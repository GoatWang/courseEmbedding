miller chief operating officer and chief scientific officer on this call we will be making forwardlooking statements involving known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause catalysts actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results a number of factors including those described in catalysts annual report on form k for the fiscal year  and its other filings with the us securities and exchange commission could adversely affect catalyst all forwardlooking statements are qualified in the interim by these cautionary statements and catalyst undertakes no obligation to revise or update this presentation to reflect events or circumstances after that date  after the date hereof at this time it is my pleasure to turn the call over to pat mcenany our chief executive officer patrick j mcenany thanks ali and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter results and update call on todays call i will give you an update of our activities and progress so far this year including our recent nda submission in firdapses precommercialization activities and infrastructure preparedness ahead of the potential fda approval steve miller will provide status report on our pipeline and give scientific updates following ali will give a brief review of the financial results for the quarter lastly we will take your questions recently we announced the initiation of a rolling submission of a new drug application to the fda for firdapse for the treatment of lamberteaton myasthenic syndrome as you know firdapse has received breakthrough therapy designation from the fda for the treatment of lems as well as the orphan drug designations for lems and congenital myasthenic syndrome our rolling nda submission for firdapse marks an important step forward in our reference to provide a safe and effective fda approved treatment option for patients in the us who develop lems which is a rare debilitating and in some cases can be a life threatening disease we expect to complete the submission of the nda in the fourth quarter of  at which time we will be requesting a priority review of our application given this timeline we would hope to receive approval of our nda by midyear  and we expect to continue to work closely with the fda as we seek approval of our nda we will also continue to provide access to firdapse through our expanded access program as part of our commitment to ensure that all eligible patients have access to firdapse we recently announced the appointment of gary ingenito as chief medical officer dr ingenito has more than  years of experience leading pharmaceutical development for drugs and biologics in this new role he will oversee all clinical development programs medical affairs regulatory and other related functions this appointment helps us to continue working towards expanding the use of firdapse for other indications furthering the development of cpp and potentially expanding our development pipeline to include new drugs for other rare diseases we expect to announce shortly the hiring of a permanent chief commercial officer given the unique commercial challenges and launching orphan drugs i am pleased that we are able to attract passionate industry veterans from senior leadership roles at very successful rare disease biopharmaceutical companies over the past few months we have accelerated our preparations for the commercial launch of firdapse we have programs underway to identify specialty prescribers at centers of excellence and large neurology practices patient identification is important for any rare disease and it is a top priority for catalyst while we believe the prevalence of lems to be approximately  patients in the united states there is no substitute for bottoms up approach that relies on finding and counting addressable patients to ensure that we identify as many patients as possible ahead of the firdapse launch we will use multiple approaches including our expanded access program clinical trial experience center of excellence profiling and holding regional meetings through patient efficacy groups with lems patients and their caregivers in addition we continue to conduct market research and are currently finalizing publication plans developing a patient support program as well as market access and pricing research with private and public payers last quarter we announced top line results in openlabel proofofconcept trial of cpp for vigabatrin used to treat patients suffering from tourettes disorder that were refractory to all other previous treatments one of four patients demonstrated a very clear clinically significant reduction in tics and two others showed about a  reduction in tics tourettes disorder is a neuro developmental disorder characterized by multiple tics and among the most traumatic and disabling complex tics can resolve in self arm complex vocal tics and other neuro behavioral problems we see this data as promising and think that the results demonstrated an encouraging signal of activity in adult treatment refractory patients with tourettes disorder we believe that cpp mechanism of action delegates the potential for cpp to be a candidate for the treatment of tourettes disorder we are evaluating our options and are in the process of determining the next steps in development i’ll now turn the call over to steve miller who will provide updates on our pipeline and scientific developments steven r miller thanks pat and good morning everyone after the recent commencement of our rolling nda submission of firdapse for lems we are continuing the exploration for additional indications including congenital myasthenic syndromes or cms and a sub group of myasthenia gravis patients that are zero positive for the musk antibodies as pat mentioned last quarter we announced top line results in open label proofofconcept trial of cpp or vigabatrin used to treat patients suffering from tourettes disorder that were refractory to all other previous treatments one of four patients demonstrated a very clear clinically significant reduction in tics and two others showed about a  reduction in tics the eightweek clinical trial was designed as an open label trial to evaluate the potential effect of gabaaminotransferase inhibition as a mechanism for reducing tics in patients with treatment refractory tourettes disorder vigabatrin was used as a research surrogate to demonstrate the utility of gabaaminotransferase blockade with the expectation that upon successfully demonstrating the utility of this mechanism further development activities would focus on the potentially safer more potent gabaaminotransferase inhibitor cpp we believe that the clinical results from this small open label trial despite its limitations are encouraging and warrant further investigation the only formerly approved medications to treat tourettes disorder are first generation antipsychotic drugs which block d dopamine receptors however they are infrequently used in clinical practice because of their severe and unacceptable side effects the gabaaminotransferase inhibitor class drugs may offer new hope to treatmentrefractory tourettes disorder patients who have no other options in march the fda granted orphan drug designation to firdapse for treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes and as previously noted we continued to explore the potential to treat a sub group of myasthenia gravis patients with firdapse myasthenia gravis animal models that are zero positive for musk antibodies respond well to diaminopyridine or dap the active ingredient in firdapse there are currently no fda approved therapies for this form of myasthenia gravis including mestinon which is approved to treat myasthenia gravis but it is not effective in treating this sub group of patients we are currently finalizing potential study designs discussing the indication with key opinion leaders that treat this form of myasthenia gravis and evaluating the competitive landscape regarding any off label therapies currently in use cpp has received orphan drug designation in both the us and the european union for infantile spasms which affects  to  infants globally including  to  in the us we continue to explore other indications such as epilepsy tourettes disorder and post traumatic stress disorder we are also investigating selected diseases in which modulation of gaba levels may be beneficial we are currently evaluating cpp in a phase b multi dose safety and tolerance study we recently revised a protocol for this study to add additional testing to assess whether the surrogate models have potential efficacy in treating tourettes disorder might be observed in study participants these changes have delayed slightly our reporting of top line results from this study and we now expect to report top line results from this study during the fourth quarter of  i will now turn the call over to ali to review our financial results alicia grande thank you steve for the quarter ended june   catalyst reported a gaap net loss of approximately  million or  per basic undiluted share compared to a gaap net loss for approximately  million or  per basic and diluted share for the same period in  excluding noncash gain of approximately  attributable to a change in fair value of liabilityclassified warrants nongaap net loss was approximately  million or  per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of  in comparison nongaap net loss for the second quarter of  was  million or  per basic and diluted share which excludes noncash expense of approximately  attributable to a change in fair value of liabilityclassified warrants research and development expenses for the second quarter of  was approximately  million compared to an rd spend of approximately  million in the second quarter of  research and development expenses increased when compared to the same period in  as we increased activities related to our nda filing for firdapse and ongoing studies and trials and decreased activities related to our completed phase  trial for firdapse we expect that our rd spend for the rest of the year will increase as we prepare for and submit our nda for firdapse and as we increased activities in our ongoing studies and trials general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of  totaled approximately  million compared to approximately  in the second quarter of  the increase from period to period is primarily due to ramping up of precommercial expenses and headcounts as we prepare for the commercialization of firdapse at the development stage biopharmaceutical company catalyst had no revenues in either the second quarter of  or the second quarter of  at june   catalyst had cash cash equivalents cvs and shortterm investments of about approximately  million and no debt this includes proceeds from our february  offering in which we sold  million shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of approximately  million we believe that these resources will give us sufficient runway to anticipate approval and subsequent product launch assuming this occurs in  additionally the company will be presenting at a number of healthcare conferences during the remaining of the year including the piper healthcare conference in december more detailed financial information and analysis maybe following the company’s quarterly report on form q which was filed with the securities and exchange commission yesterday august   and can be found in the investor relations page of our website at wwwcatalystpharmacom i would now like to turn the call back to pat patrick j mcenany thanks ali before we answer your questions i am going to summarize our major goals and potential milestones looking at the coming months firdapse has demonstrated how we can provide an important benefit to lems patients and continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile we have initiated a rolling nda submission to the fda and we are continuing to the work with the agency on a pathway to include certain types of cms in the initial label upon approval for lems we expect to complete the submission of the nda in the fourth quarter of this year and we’ll be requesting a priority review at that time we continue to build our commercial capabilities and plan to establish our marketing and sales teams over the next three quarters as our timeline moves closer to a potential fda approval by midyear  we are working to advance our pipeline in regulatory pathways for potential additional indications for both firdapse and cpp also importantly we are currently enrolling lems in cms patients and the expanded access program which continues to provide firdapse at no charge to patients who meet the inclusion exclusion requirements with that i’d like to thank all of you for your participation today and open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from charles duncan of piper jaffray please go ahead charles duncan good morning pat and the team congratulations on the progress in the initial filing for the firdapse nda patrick j mcenany thank you charles charles duncan thanks for taking my questions i have a couple of them i wanted to first ask you about that firdapse nda filing you are very clear in terms of planning to complete that in the fourth quarter i am wondering if you could provide us any additional color on the required work to be done to complete that are there any scientific studies or anything that need to be done or is this just preparation of the documents patrick j mcenany steve why don’t you take that steven r miller its primarily just preparation of the documents for the nda as we have previously publicly said we also continue to gather additional information to support the cms indication in our initial filing so there is some ongoing work in that regard as well charles duncan okay and then in filing that rolling submission steve or pat did you have any additional fda interaction regarding the unmet need in lems and activity by others to serve this indication or is that not something the fda would have talked to you about steven r miller well to begin with the fda would never discuss anything that goes on with any other company with us and naturally they would not discuss with other companies any communications they have with us they are very compartmentalized in that regard in terms of had we had any other discussions with the fda no our instructions and our path forward seemed very clear and we are just pursuing that and assembling the nda for filing in the fourth quarter as pat indicated charles duncan okay and regarding cms and the inclusion around certain sub groups the discussion that you had with fda what were the issues can you provide any more color on the design and timelines of any additional clinical work or perhaps it isn’t necessary steven r miller well i can’t provide any additional details at this time as we have previously indicated congenital myasthenic syndromes or cms is a spectrum of very rare neuromuscular disease it’s caused by at least  known genetic defects affecting the neuromuscular jumps in transmission they are characterized by fatigable weakness in skeletal muscles with onset generally at or shortly after birth certain of these genetic defects appear to adversely affect the calcium transport into the neuron and like the therapeutic effect a dap on neurons affected by autoantibodies to calcium channels dap can also be a therapeutic benefit to these genetic defects associated with cms that have affected calcium transport having said that that is not the entire spectrum of cms it appears as though based on the literature that a majority of cms patients will respond well to diaminopyridine we are as i pointed out continuing to collect data on patients that are known to respond to the drug charles duncan okay and then just a question on expanded access and one quick one for ali on the expanded access program i am sure that you are tracking the use and number of patients in can you provide us any information on the number of patients and can any characterization of the call it anecdotal experience for that patient in expanded access programs patrick j mcenany charles we have previously stated that we are not going to talk about numbers where we stand in headcount in the expanded access program we just don’t want to get into a position of having to update that quarterly we’re pleased with the progress its gaining traction for us our rare disease clinical liasons are in the field meeting with kols and centers of excellence that have a number of patients that are very interested in joining the expanded access program that had either lems or cms so i would say to one finding so far as we are surprised at a little bit this split if you will between cms and lems patients look like cms is looking like perhaps a larger indication than we thought potentially charles duncan okay so it sounds like more cms than lems patients steven r miller no but it is certainly closer than we thought charles duncan and the awareness is pretty decent of the program and of the indications patrick j mcenany well like i said its gaining traction we’re advertising in muscle  nerve publication to neuromuscular specialist who are advertising in quest which is the ndas inhouse publication that goes out to about  patients of our program so we are pleased with the response that we are getting and again its gaining traction charles duncan okay and quick question for ali and then i’ll hop back in the queue with the  million that you say will last through  including the prelaunch ph i am assuming that includes a bill of inventory for firdapse commercial inventory but does it also come back to the pipeline include fully funding tourette syndrome phase  patrick j mcenany that depends on the size the magnitude of the study that we do charles i would say to you i think that we have the room within our budget to go to a phase  study again depending on where we do it and the size of that study so it is not like we will need a partner to take this to the next step we will have the funds available charles duncan okay sounds good thanks for the added color and looking forward to in the second half of the year patrick j mcenany thanks charles operator operator instructions mr mcenany there are no further questions at this time patrick j mcenany okay operator thank you very much thanks for your participation today everybody operator the call has now ended thank you for your attendance you may now
