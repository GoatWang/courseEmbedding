forecasts so far astray and to set forth some important lessons that could lead to an improved forecasting methodology a second purpose is to provide an analysis of the current situation in the international oil market and its implications for future petroleum prices over the nearterm midterm and longterm by applying some realistic judgments about the inherent uncertainties in the principal factors likely to affect those prices a perspective is developed that is intended to be helpful to buyers sellers and governments around the world even though it does not rest upon a single trajectory

in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide based on the current concept that nuclear attack would occur only after an international crisis thus providing from several days to several months of strategic warning this study maintains that damage limiting systems can be designed that would reduce present estimates of about  million fatalities by  percent two extreme programs are

american institutions by william m brown book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide postattack recovery strategies  final report by william m brown book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide in the context of lowbudget civil defense cd programs strategies available for postattack recovery cannot rationally be separated from policies which would support a cd mobilization during an emergency an assessment is made of  areas in which federal policy would strongly affect survival and recovery preparations during a nuclear crisis many of these areas have not been adequately studied also the needed policies do not exist for nearly all of them the analysis finds however that most of the missing policies might be developed during an emergency of several weeks or more if prior studies are completed to delineate the options two important themes evolved one was that the survival of the federal government could not be assured following a large attack but that its survivability could be greatly enhanced if the needed cd policies are established in time the second was that the federal cd role should often be a supportive one rather than the controlling one that is generally assumed author a question of economics  the impact of phased increases in canadian oil and gas prices  final report by irving leveson book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide on reorganizing after nuclear attack by william m brown book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide even though a major fraction of the physical resources survive a nuclear attack the economic viability of the country is not assured for want of an effective understanding of the needs of the postattack reorganization period the country could experience economic starvation in the midst of plenty the purpose of preplanning for a civil defense mobilization is to enable it to proceed rapidly and effectively at the time it is needed thus if the preparations are satisfactory the efforts which would promote the subsequent postattack recovery could reasonably be balanced and thereby not only make the recovery more likely but more rapid changing prospects missions and roles for civil defense  by hudson institute book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the major conclusion for civil defense planning is that small or intrawar attacks arising out of deep crises are the easiest and cheapest to prepare against apparently the least unlikely and yet among the most neglected of civil defense contingencies while the possibility of massive surprise attack should not be ignored the relative overemphasis upon it has hampered realistic planning efforts a more realistic allocation of planning emphases leads to increased interest in civil defense and emergency planning programs containing some or all of the following elements  a crisis mobilization base  a tension mobilization base  a postattack recuperation base  possible arms control and increased defense agreements including cooperative civil defense and  programs that vary protection with population density to reduce the lucrativeness of population targets strategic and political aspects of such program elements are discussed and on balance they are recommended a new look at the design of lowbudget civil defense systems by william m brown book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the feasibility of designing highly effective lowcost civil defense systems is examined in relationship to various war outbreak scenarios and the utility of the associated preattack warning period it is argued that with moderate confidence such highly effective systems can be designed they would depend upon a general mobilization of civilian resources during an emergency to greatly expand and improve any existing cd capability ideally such designs can visualize attaining the goal of zero casualties however a dynamic plan would contain several options to handle the many imperfections which would almost certainly appear during implementation the essential elements of the cd designs are examined separately for technical political administrative and strategic feasibility it is concluded that this approach offers substantial promise for future cd developments a perspective on current acid rain issues by frank e armbruster book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide emergency mobilization for postattack reorganization by william m brown book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the report emphasizes the dangers to eventual reconstruction that are posed by the disorganization inevitably following a nuclear war what can go wrong in this reorganization period is examined by the use of scenarios and analogy it is then suggested that during the crisis period preceding a nuclear war a number of useful actions enhancing the chance of postattack recovery should be undertaken as part of an emergency mobilization for civil defense this mobilization might instigate actions which would help us society to negotiate the reorganization period successfully the problems of creating such countermeasures appear to be formidable but possible if a the usable warning provided by the crisis is of sufficient duration several weeks or more and b the preplanning for the mobilization action is completed in advance of the need author timecompression potential of an emergency blast shelter program by hudson institute book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide an examination is made of the nations potential for very rapid construction of an urban blast shelter system during severe nuclear crises assuming the existence of the necessary plans and preparations for a major civil defense mobilization involving nearly the entire us population it is found that the material and labor resources of the us should permit an austere shelter system to be constructed within a few ie  weeks austerity in the above sense would mean a crowded shelters  people occupying a space normally allotted for one and b deferring to a later time the installation of entrances ventilation and other habitability items the time estimates are made on technical considerations alone it is assumed that the important problems of planning organizing administrating and decisionmaking would not significantly delay the program a question of economics  the impact of phased increases in canadian oil and
