as substitutes for or superior to results determined in accordance with gaap and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap special items included in teradatas  second quarter gaap operating income results as reported in this release included  million of stockbased compensation expense  million of amortization of

development tax credit this benefit was included in teradatas nongaap results in the fourth quarter of  since the benefit related to the  tax reporting period however teradata could not include the tax benefit in its gaap results in the fourth quarter of  due to the american taxpayer relief act of  not being enacted until january  as a result the  million tax benefit was included in teradatas  gaap net income but was excluded from the companys nongaap net income the following tables reconcile teradatas actual and projected results and eps under gaap to the companys actual and projected nongaap results and eps for the periods presented which exclude certain items our management regularly uses supplemental nongaap financial measures such as gross margin operating income net income and eps excluding certain items internally to understand manage and evaluate our business and support operating decisions the company believes such nongaap financial measures  provide useful information

company believes that free cash flow is a useful nongaap measure for investors teradata defines free cash flow as cash providedused by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software free cash flow does not have a uniform definition under gaap and therefore teradatas definition may differ from other companies definitions of this measure teradatas management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations in particular free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures for among other things investment in the companys existing businesses strategic acquisitions strengthening the companys balance sheet repurchase of the companys stock and repayment of the companys debt obligations if any free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure this nongaap measure is not meant to be considered in isolation as a substitute for or superior to results determined in accordance with gaap and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed

fool answers contact us login search search  things teradata corps management wants you to know the data analytics software maker is selling its wares under a new subscriptionbased pricing model the transition is hurting teradatas revenues right now but should start paying dividends as early as next year anders bylund tmfzahrim jul   at am data analytics specialist teradata nysetdc reported secondquarter results early thursday morning adjusted earnings came in  below the yearago periods results at  per diluted share and topline sales fell  to land at  million both of these figures were at or below the low end of teradatas guidance for the quarter and they also fell short of wall streets expectations that might sound like a recipe for hurting teradata investors right in the pocketbook but thats not what happened at all instead share prices raced as much as  higher on the news swinging very close to the stocks week highs crazy i know  stocks are not supposed to soar when the company misses its earnings targets but this move actually makes sense these three key details from teradatas earnings report and conference call will show you how and why image source getty images  accelerating guidance after dodging fullyear guidance in the last two earnings reports teradata finally put together a framework for the second half of  its looking pretty good fullyear revenues should come in roughly  below the  tally thats a smaller drop than the  seen in the first quarter and obviously below the  plunge in the second quarter in other words sales trends should turn significantly more positive in the second half and teradata emphasized that the fourth quarter should outperform the third by a wide margin this guidance update played a large part in teradatas sudden stock price boost on thursday  subscription revenues peeling back one more layer of teradatas evolving business model we get to one important reason why sales are stumbling now but headed upward later on the company has been offering a new subscriptionbased pricing model for its enterprise data analytics services for less than a year in the long run management would love to move every customer to a subscription plan because it turns a onetime payment into a longterm contract with smaller fees paid over several years management sees this as a winwin for teradata and its clients with our simplified pricing tiers and subscriptionbased licenses it is easy for customers to get started quickly and affordably and pay as they go instead of working through a long capital approval process said chief product officer oliver ratzesberger in the earnings call according to a transcript compiled by seeking alpha we are seeing customers adopt subscription licenses more rapidly than expected and this is building future recurring product revenue for us teradata would not be the first enterprise computing company to move in this direction adobe systems nasdaqadbe headed down that path a few years ago and the photoshop makers revenue chart speaks volumes about how that move is working out adbe revenue ttm data by ycharts these days subscription sales account for  of adobes total quarterly revenues up from  in  and just  five years ago teradata hopes to follow a similar parabolic curve over the next few years and is arguably sitting in that uncomfortable revenue trough that adobe experienced in   the bounce is coming and soon cfo stephen scheppmann called  a building year where the company is setting the stage for greater things in the future revenue growth is coming back as soon as  as the subscriptionbased pricing model continues to evolve and the company is not afraid to invest in itself while shares are cheap customers are embracing our hybrid cloud deployment and pricing consumption options and as a result we are even more confident in our strategy and plan to acquire up to  million of our stock during the second half of  scheppmann said lowcost buybacks can be a tremendously effective use of cash assuming that the turnaround really is right around the corner as such scheppmanns statement here is a  million vote of confidence in a successful transition to subscriptiondriven sales growth so all things considered teradata cleared up some confusion around its evolving business model in this quarterly report sales are slow right now but for good reason and a big bounce is coming that was all it took to trigger a quick share price jump on thursday anders bylund has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends adobe systems and teradata

forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements in our public filings or other public statements are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements or other public statements

projected plans and objectives statements preceded by followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “projects” “estimates” “plans” “may increase” “may fluctuate” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “should” “would” “may” and “could” are generally forwardlooking in nature and not historical facts you should understand that the factors described under “risk factors” and the following important factors could affect our future results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forwardlooking statements • our ability to timely and effectively implement our business transformation plan and the execution of our new strategy • the rapidly changing and intensely competitive nature of the information technology “it” industry and the analytic data platform business including the ongoing consolidation activity threats from new and emerging analytic data technologies and competitors and pressure on achieving continued priceperformance gains for analytic data solutions • fluctuations in our operating results timing of transactions unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles and the difficulty of accurately estimating revenues particularly in light of our strategic shift to more revenue over time and the difficulty predicting the extent to which our customers will choose these deployment options • our ability to successfully leverage acquisitions • the impact of global economic fluctuations on the markets in general or on the ability of our suppliers and customers to meet their commitments to us or the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers and • risks inherent in operating in foreign countries including the impact of foreign currency fluctuations economic political legal regulatory compliance cultural and other conditions abroad other factors not identified above including the risk factors

highpriority and complex analytical needs our offerings include analytics solutions ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions these solutions include software and hardware technology components such as data warehousing big data and tools for data integration data discovery and business intelligence our services help companies architect manage and  table of contents integrate their complex and everchanging analytic ecosystem and include technology and data architecture consulting analytic business consulting open source consulting and “asaservice” offerings in the cloud additionally we offer a comprehensive set of support services in  we announced our new teradata everywhere tm offering through which we provide our teradata database software in a productionscale and deployment agnostic manner as a result we now offer our customers flexible deployment options onpremises in a private cloud in the public cloud in the cloud at a teradata data center or as a hybrid combination of these offeringsteradata operates from numerous locations within the united states us with the primary locations being dayton ohio johns creek atlanta georgia and rancho bernardo san diego california in addition we have sales services research and development and administrative offices located in  countries for the full year ended december    we had net income of  million and total revenues of  billion  of which approximately  was derived from the data and analytics segment and  from the marketing applications segment which was sold on july   for financial information about these segments and geographic information see “note —segment other supplemental information and concentrations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report history teradata was formed in  as a delaware corporation driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data in  teradata established a massively parallel relational database management system that enabled companies to easily scale their data management needs revolutionizing data analysis for customers in  att corp att acquired ncr corporation ncr and later that year the combined company of att  ncr purchased teradata in  att spun off ncr including teradata to form the independent publiclytraded ncr on september   the independent publiclytraded teradata corporation nyse tdc was created when ncr was effectively separated into two independent publiclytraded companies through the distribution of  of its teradata data warehousing business to shareholders of ncr since that time we have increased our investments and focus to be the best analytical partner to the world’s leading firms we continue to invest to extend our research and development in analytics and analytic consulting on july   we completed the sale of our marketing applications business to exclusively focus on our analytics solutions business in support of our transformation plans industry and market opportunity our view is that analytics is and will continue to be a management priority for most companies and in particular for the majority of our customers we believe we have a large market opportunity as teradata’s strategy encompasses the multibillion dollar and growing markets of data management analytic tools and consulting and packaged analytics as well as the related consulting and accompanying maintenance services as organizations work to manage the evolution to increasing digital environments we believe that they will need help leveraging analytics to deliver highimpact business outcomes we also believe that companies will need help to implement the right analytic ecosystem architecture leveraging both commercial and open source technologies we have tailored teradatas offerings to meet these needs and to help companies navigate the multitude of ecosystem options as well as various alternatives for deployment we are focused on the  largest analytic opportunities globally as we believe that this portion of the market will have the highest growth in the amount of data analytic processing power they consume we plan to grow revenue in this market segment by expanding our existing customers analytical ecosystems as well as adding new customers overall we believe that key differentiators for teradata include the following • proven experience in solving complex analytical problems • realworld expertise deploying ecosystems and analytics and • leading productionscale deployment agnostic technologies customers our new strategy prioritizes our sales focus on business users as well as technology buyers at leading companies across a broad set of industries including bankingfinancial services communications including telecommunications ebusiness and media and entertainment energy government insurance and healthcare  table of contents manufacturing oil and gas retail travel and transportation logistics and utilities these industries provide a good fit for our analytics solutions and services as they tend to have the greatest analytic potential with large and growing data volumes and expanding sources of data complex data management requirements or large and varied groups of users the extent to which any given customer contributes to our revenues generally varies significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter therefore a customer with a large order in one quarter is likely to generate additional revenue for teradata in subsequent periods as we provide support services and additional capacity as their analytical ecosystem evolves and grows to meet their business requirements for the year ended december   our top ten customers collectively accounted for approximately  of our total revenues moreover teradata’s revenue can vary considerably from period to period given the different growth and purchasing patterns of our existing customers’ data warehouse systems discovery platforms and data management platforms as well as the variable timing of new customer orders due to the size and complexity of these transactions purchases the sales cycle for a new analytic solution is often fairly long typically more than a year historically our results in any particular quarter have generally been dependent on our ability to generate a relatively small number of large orders for that quarter however we are actively converting customers from perpetual to over time pricing models which will likely create many more smaller but more frequent transactions which will likely decrease the overall variability in the timing of our revenue as we transition to new operating expensebased deployment and purchasing options our strategy teradata is focusing on addressing the needs of the analytics future as we enable organizations to deliver value through analytics through our consultative approach focused on leading with business outcomes our goal is to serve as a trusted advisor to both the business and technical leaders in our customers’ organizations our business analytics solutions are ideally suited for the world’s largest companies who have the most complex

thirdparty influencers these strategies include targeted accountbased marketing our global website webinars physical and virtual trade shows and conferences public and media relations social media and an extensive customer reference program sources of materials our hardware components are assembled and configured by flextronics international ltd “flextronics” our platform line is designed to leverage the components from industry leaders our data storage devices and memory components utilize industrystandard technologies but are selected and configured to work optimally with our software and hardware platform flextronics also procures a wide variety of components used in the assembly process on our behalf although many of these components are available from multiple sources teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality cost and delivery typically these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes andor facilities to ensure business continuity of supply given our strategy to outsource product assembly activities to flextronics and to source certain components from single suppliers a disruption in production at flextronics or at a supplier or a global shortage of components could impact the timing or profitability of customer shipments competition  we compete in a large and growing market that is attractive to both legacy and new competitors our competition includes new analytics services companies cloud vendors and open source providers as well as large traditional competitors such as ibm and oracle corporation oracle we believe our focus on business outcomes and proven success will enable us to successfully compete and win with the largest analytic opportunities in the market we believe our proven architecture for both structured and unstructured data integrated solutions with highperforming and scalable technology flexible deployment options in the cloud and onpremises deep and broad consulting and support services capabilities strong customer relationships and our successful track record will collectively enable us to continue to compete successfully we also compete successfully in the marketplace by offering our ecosystem architecture consulting to help customers bring together our leading software hardware and related services with open source offerings for more information see item a risk factors elsewhere in this annual report competitors take different technical and integration approaches to addressing data analytic needs and therefore they often recommend a different architecture than we do we believe that our customers recognize the advantages of our technologies and our approach as described above key factors used to evaluate competitors in these markets include data analytics experience business outcome delivery hybrid cloud offerings and experience customer references technology leadership product quality performance scalability availability and manageability support and consulting services capabilities management  table of contents of technologies in a complex analytical ecosystem industry knowledge and total cost of ownership we believe we have a competitive advantage in providing complete integrated and optimized analytic data platforms and analytic services that address customers’ business technical and architecture requirements our differentiation is especially strong with customers that have mission critical complex large scale environments and requirements many companies participate in adjacent areas of the analytics market such as enterprise analytic and business intelligence application software the status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete our products also complement offerings of some of our competitors with whom we have formed partnerships to work with their business intelligence and application software businesses examples of these companies include both ibm and oracle due to their acquisitions of other business intelligence and consulting companies in recent years seasonality historically our sales are seasonal in line with capital spending patterns of our customers with lower revenue typically in the first quarter and higher revenue generally in the fourth quarter of each calendar year such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume timing and mix of product sales typically cash provided by operating activities is higher in the first half of the year due to the higher receivable balances at december  and the increase in deferred revenue resulting from the timing of annual renewals of our maintenance support agreements in addition revenue in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months these factors among others as more fully described in item a risk factors elsewhere in this annual report make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results research and development rd we remain focused on designing and developing hybrid cloud solutions that anticipate our customers evolving technological and delivery needs as we seek improvements in our products and services we also consider our customers current needs as we design our new technology so that new generations of the teradata database software and platform technology are compatible with prior generations of our technology we believe our extensive rd workforce is one of our core strengths the global rd team is located in multiple facilities around the world to take advantage of global engineering talent we anticipate that we will continue to have significant rd expenditures which may include complementary strategic acquisitions in order to help support the flow of innovative highquality products cloudbased offerings services

carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this annual report based on the information currently known to us we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company in each of these categories of risks however the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business in addition past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our business transformation plan and execution of our new strategy  including transition to new business focus areas and delivery models sales structures talent management restructuring and cost rationalization initiatives could adversely impact our business and financial results the successful implementation of our business transformation plan to evolve with the market and expand our market opportunity presents significant organizational and infrastructure challenges as a result we may not be able to implement and realize the anticipated benefits from our plan events and circumstances such as financial or unforeseen difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing desired outcomes any failure to implement the plan in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized there may be consequences internal control issues or business impacts that were not expected additionally as a result of our restructuring efforts in connection with our business transformation plan we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows from time to time the company exits businesses or attempts to sell assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives such as the marketing applications business which was sold on july   any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition risks related to obtaining necessary government or regulatory approvals risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company’s control and risks related to the need to provide transition services to the disposed business which may result in the diversion of resources and focus as part of our transformation strategy the company will release new offerings and employ new product and services delivery methods such as softwareonly software as a service and cloud offerings it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary business models infrastructure and systems to support the business this includes having or hiring the right talent to execute our business strategy market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirements and optimally price our products and services to meet customer demand and cover our costs our gotomarket strategy also must adjust to customers changing buying preferences and our new products and delivery options and there can be no assurance that our new gotomarket plans will adequately and completely address such preferences new product and services offerings may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical legal or other costs for example with our cloudbased offerings market acceptance is affected by a variety of factors including information security reliability performance the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data and access this data once a contract has expired and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or  table of contents regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers if we are unable to respond to these threats our business could be harmed economic pressures and uncertaintyour business is affected by the global economies in which we operate and the economic climate of the industries we serve our business and results of operations are affected by international national and regional economic conditions in particular the it industry in which we operate is susceptible to significant changes in the strength of the economy and the financial health of companies and governmental entities that make capital commitments for new technologies since mid we have seen a shift in the market and in customers’ buying patterns with respect to large capital investments and related services accordingly downturns or uncertainty in the global or regional economies in which we operate or certain economic sectors such as retail manufacturing financial services or government may adversely impact our business for example adverse changes to the economy could impact the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us in addition decreased or more closely scrutinized capital spending in our customers’ businesses and in the industries we also serve may adversely impact our business uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments accordingly global economic and market conditions may cause material impacts on our results of operations prospects and financial condition the company’s success in periods of economic uncertainty is also dependent in part on our ability to reduce costs in response to changes in demand and other activity competitionthe it industry is intensely competitive and evolving and competitive pressures could adversely affect our pricing practices or demand for our products and services we operate in the intensely competitive it industry which is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and models for consuming and delivering business and it services frequent new product introductions and price and cost reductions in general as a participant in the analytic data solutions market we face • changes in customer it spending preferences and other shifts in market demands which drive changes in the companys competition • continued pressure on priceperformance for analytic data platform solutions due to constant technology improvements in processor capacity and speed • changes in pricing marketing and product strategies such as potential aggressive price discounting and the use of different pricing models by our competitors or other factors • rapid changes in computing technology and capabilities that challenge our ability to maintain differentiation at the lower range of business intelligence analytic functions • new and emerging analytic data technologies competitors and business models • continued emergence of open source software that often attempts to rival current technology offerings at a much lower cost despite its limited functionality • rapid changes in product delivery models such as onpremises solutions versus cloud solutions • changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets and • continuing trend toward consolidation of companies which could adversely affect our ability to compete including if our key partners merge or partner with our competitors to compete successfully in this environment we must rapidly and continually design develop and market solutions and related products and services that are valued in the marketplace to do this we must react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands our market position depends on our ability to continually improve the priceperformance of our solutions while maintaining efficient operations to sustain our competitive operating margins we must also maintain the quality of our products and services throughout these shifts in market demand if we are unable to react quickly when and as needed to improve the value of our product offerings our operating results could be negatively impacted our competitors include certain larger companies such as ibm and oracle which are wellcapitalized companies with widespread distribution brand recognition and penetration of platforms and service offerings the significant purchasing and market power of these larger competitors which have greater financial resources than we do could  table of contents allow them to surpass our market penetration and marketing efforts to promote and sell their products and services in addition many other companies participate in specific areas of our business such as enterprise applications analytic data platforms and business intelligence software in some cases we may partner with a company in one area of our business and compete with them in another the status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete for analytic data solutions opportunities in such areas we also expect additional competition from both established and emerging companies failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors in these and other areas could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate additional revenues or sustain existing revenue levels analytic data solutions marketif the overall analytic data solutions market declines or does not grow we may sell fewer products and services and our business may not be able to sustain andor grow its current level of operations as the market trends toward more limited it spending there could be fewer customer transactions or smaller transactions or customers delaying investments in our products and services in the past we have seen periodic breaks in the buying patterns from some of our larger customers which indicate a level of maturation of their current data warehouse implementation or a shifting of it priorities when these customers are still leveraging the investments they have made in their core data warehousing infrastructures during past years in addition reduced prices and improvements in analytic data solutions may increase pressure on our product revenues and margins as well as on the annuity streams we receive from our maintenance business if the growth rates for the analytic data solutions market decline for any reason there could be a decrease in demand for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results renewal rates and support servicesif our existing customers fail to renew their support agreements if customers do not license updated software products on terms favorable to us or if customers do not renew their subscription license arrangements with us our revenues could be adversely affected we currently derive a significant portion of our overall revenues from maintenance services and unspecified whenandifavailable upgrades and we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from maintenance services and upgrades to updated products the terms of our standard maintenance services and software upgrade arrangements generally provide for the payment of license fees and prepayment of firstyear support fees and are generally renewable on an annual basis the it industry generally has been experiencing increasing pricing pressure from customers when purchasing or renewing support agreements mergers and acquisitions in certain industries that we serve could result in a reduction of the software and hardware being serviced and put pressure on our maintenance terms with customers who have merged given this environment there can be no assurance that our current customers will renew their maintenance agreements or agree to the same terms when they renew which could result in our reducing or losing maintenance fees if our existing customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements or if we are unable to generate additional maintenance fees through the license of updated products to existing or new customers our business and future operating results could be adversely affected replacements of older teradata systems often result in less hardware maintenance revenue since teradata’s newer hardware is designed to be more powerful use less energy and require less floor space as a result less hardware is needed for the same workload and therefore less maintenance may be required on the newer generation system however it is been common that when a customer replaces an older platform they often have also expanded the size and scope of their teradata system resulting in an increase in maintenance revenue though not at the same rate of increase as product revenue additionally teradata’s solution offerings have been expanded to include subscription licenses hosting arrangements and software as a service which can change the timing of when revenues are recognized additionally future revenue streams could be adversely affected if customers do not renew their subscription licenses hosting arrangements or software as a service arrangements  table of contents operating result fluctuationsour financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results our quarterly and annual financial results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control in particular if transactions that we expect to close by the end of a quarter are not closed until a later date our revenue andor net income for that quarter could be substantially below expectations especially given the large size of our transactions these and any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us not to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations the resulting failure to meet market expectations could cause a decrease in our stock price these factors include the risks discussed elsewhere in this section and the following • downturns in our customers’ businesses in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business • changes in demand for our products and services including changes in growth rates in the analytic data solutions market • the size timing and contractual terms of large orders for our products and services which may impact in particular our quarterly operating results either positively or negatively • possible delays in our ability to recognize revenue as the result of contract terms • the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers • changes in pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors new pricing strategies or other factors • changes in how customers prefer to purchase analytical solutions • our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and services • changes in the mix of pretax earnings attributable to domestic versus international sales • seasonal fluctuations in buying patterns • future acquisitions and divestitures of technologies products and businesses • unexpected needs for capital expenditures or other unanticipated expenses and • changes in certain assumptions estimates and judgments of management which are required in connection with the preparation of the company’s financial statements that could affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities acquisitions and alliancesour ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and effectively manage acquisitions may be an important element of future growth we are continually evaluating the most effective ways to extend teradata’s core technology and expand our family of compatible analytic platforms and solutions to address multiple market segments and solution offerings from time to time this includes acquisitions equity investments or joint ventures such transactions entail various risks including risks associated with • assimilating and integrating different business operations corporate cultures personnel infrastructure and technologies or products acquired or licensed • retaining key employees and maintaining relationships with employees customers clients or suppliers of the acquired companies • recurring revenue of the acquired company may decline or fail to be renewed • the potential for unknown liabilities as well as undetected internal control compliance or quality issues within the acquired or combined business or additional costs not anticipated at the time of acquisition • disruptions of our ongoing business or inability to successfully incorporate acquired products services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality • failure to achieve the projected synergies after integration of acquired companies or a decline in value of the acquired business and related impairments • funding acquisition activities whether through the use of existing cash reserves or through the use of debt and the related impact on our liquidity and financial condition and • failure to realize all the economic benefits from these acquisitions equity investments or joint ventures could result in an impairment of goodwill intangible assets or other assets which could result in a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  table of contents our operating results may fluctuate as a result of acquisitions and related integration activities as well as other strategic growth transactions and there is a risk that our financial results may be adversely affected changing tax ratesa change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns changes in available tax credits especially surrounding tax credits in the us for our research and development activities and the repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition changes in us or international tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside the us until those earnings are repatriated to the us in addition unilateral or multijurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity to address “base erosion and profit shifting” by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows sales cycle variationsunanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles make accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results the size and timing of large orders for our products and services varies considerably which can impact results from quarter to quarter the process we use to forecast sales and trends in our business relies heavily on estimates of closure on a transactionspecific basis it is very difficult to predict sales in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles make accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results the length of our sales cycle varies depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control including the size and complexity of a potential transaction the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities and our current and potential customers’ internal budgeting and approval process as well as overall macroeconomic conditions as a result of a generally long sales cycle we may expend significant effort over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order but ultimately not complete the sale or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated our revenue from different customers varies from quarter to quarter and a customer with a large order in one quarter may generate significantly lower revenue in subsequent periods our results in any particular quarter have generally been dependent on the timing of a relatively small number of large transactions due to resulting fluctuations we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue margins and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance in addition the budgeting and it capital spending cycles of our customers and potential customers make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results spending may be particularly heavy in our fourth quarter because of large enterprise customers placing orders before the expiration of it budgets tied to that calendar year our operating expense budgets including such categories as headcount real estate and technology resources are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term failure to generate projected revenues for a specified period could adversely impact our operating results reducing net income or causing an operating loss for  table of contents that period the deferral or nonoccurrence of such sales revenues could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter and could negatively impact our business in future periods seasonal variabilityseasonal trends in sales of our products and services could adversely affect our quarterly operating results in general we see fluctuations in buying patterns with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume timing and mix of product sales in addition revenue in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months which further impacts our ability to predict financial results accurately and enhances the enterprise risks inherent in our business these and other factors make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately revenue mix variabilityour revenue is variable depending on the mix of products and services in any given period and changes in the mix of products and services that we sell could materially adversely affect our operating results our business model is based on our anticipated mix of products and services and the corresponding profit margins for such products and services unfavorable shifts in such mix could adversely impact our results of operations and require changes to our business model consulting services margins are generally lower than the other elements of our analytic data solutions in addition when we use third parties to supplement some consulting services we provide to customers this generally results in lower margin rates as a result increases in consulting services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues may decrease overall margins we also realize different average selling prices and margins on different versions of our analytic data platforms as well as certain components we resell as part of our solutions and the mix of such hardware and software varies from quarter to quarter depending on customer requirements in addition changes in the price and performance of our analytic data platforms particularly for certain hardware components could negatively impact maintenance and support services revenues additionally as we implement part of our business transformation plan and shift from upfront perpetual licenses to recurring over time models for both onpremises and cloud offerings our revenue mix may be impacted advancement of our solutionsthe solutions we sell are advanced and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions in a competitive demanding and rapidly changing environment to succeed in the intensely competitive it industry we must continually improve refresh and expand our product and service offerings to include newer features functionality delivery options or solutions and keep pace with pricetoperformance gains in the it industry shortened product life cycles due to customer demands and competitive pressures impact the pace at which we must introduce and implement new technology this requires a high level of innovation by both our software developers and the suppliers of the thirdparty software components included in our systems in addition bringing new solutions to the market entails a costly and lengthy process and requires us to accurately anticipate customer needs and technology trends we must continue to respond to market demands develop leading technologies and maintain leadership in analytic data solutions performance and scalability or our business operations may be adversely affected we must also anticipate and respond to customer demands regarding the compatibility of our current and prior offerings these demands could hinder the pace of introducing and implementing new technology our future results may be affected if our products cannot effectively interface and perform well with software products of other companies and with our customers’ existing it infrastructures or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enter into agreements allowing integration of thirdparty technology with the teradata database and software platforms our efforts to develop the interoperability of our products may require significant investments of capital and employee resources in addition many of our principal products are used with products offered by third parties and in the future some vendors of nonteradata products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products technical information and marketing and sales support  table of contents as a result of these and other factors our ability to introduce new or improved solutions could be adversely impacted there can be no assurance that our innovations will be profitable and if we cannot successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions our business and operating results could be impacted if we were to lose our significant technology advantage our market share and growth could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to deliver products features and functionality as projected we may be unable to meet our commitments to customers which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business highly advanced productsour products include highly advanced technology and as we develop new products with greater capacity and performance capabilities the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems despite rigorous testing prior to their release and welldesigned quality processes our software and hardware products may contain undetected errors or security flaws which may be found after the products are introduced and shipped this risk is enhanced when products are first introduced or when new versions are released as well as when we develop products with more advanced technology since the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability quality or operability problems the correction and detection of errors may cause delays lost revenues and incremental costs errors in our software products could also affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products while we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors our customers who rely on our solutions for businesscritical applications are more sensitive to product errors which could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as harm our reputation these and other risks associated with new product and service offerings may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and future performance product introductions and certain enhancements of existing products by us in future periods may also reduce demand for our existing products or could delay purchases by customers awaiting arrival of our new products as new or enhanced products are introduced we must successfully manage the transition from older products in the ordinary course of business we continually evaluate opportunities for new product and service offerings new markets and new geographic sectors and development of such opportunities could entail certain business risks which could affect our financial condition in addition due to the complexity of many of our offerings we may not be able to meet customer requirements with respect to consulting services without incurring costs greater than expected levels information systems and securitya breach of security disruption or failure of our information systems or those of our third party providers could adversely impact our business and financial results our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases and the computer equipment and database information of certain suppliers and other third parties from damage by among other things earthquake fire natural disaster cyberattacks power loss telecommunications failures unauthorized intrusions malicious or unintended insider actions that cause loss of data or loss of systems and other events despite our contingency planning events of this nature may still result in system failures and other interruptions in our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we generally operate pursuant to a businesstobusiness model such that our customers buy or lease hardware systems used in connection with our solutions and the customers deploy and operate those solutions with respect to these kinds of customer onpremises solutions the customer directly or through its selected services providers manages all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions including any personally identifiable data or information  such as nonpublic data regarding our customers’ employees customer’s customers consumers data subjects individuals’ identities individual financial accounts and health information regulated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  however some of our services including our software as a service or cloud offerings may require us to deploy or operate solutions for our customers directly or through the use of third  table of contents party services providers either onpremises at customerselected data center facilities or at thirdpartyhosted data center facilities selected by us with respect to these kinds of cloud and nontraditional solution deployments and operations we and such service providers have increased roles responsibilities and risk exposures regarding some or all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions on our systems or those of selected thirdparty providers if unauthorized access to or use of such information or systems occurs despite data security measures and third party commitments to protect them our results of operation reputation and relationships with our customers could be adversely impacted additionally experienced computer programmers nation state sponsored advanced persistent code “nssapc” attacks from countries such as iran china and certain european eastern bloc countries and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or that of our third party providers and misappropriate or compromise our intellectual property or other confidential information or that of our customers create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products we have reason to believe that at least one attempted nssapc cyberattack occurred against our systems in  although we do not believe that it was successful or that there was any adverse impact to the company in connection with the incident despite the fact that our preventative and remediation tools and actions may have mitigated or preempted this attack we have since taken additional steps designed to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems however there can be no assurance that our defensive measures will be adequate to prevent them in the future also like many other companies our workstations are regularly subject to penetration attempts and malicious threats by hackers and despite our defensive measures we may not always be able to detect mitigate or preempt them all breaches of security and disruptions of our information systems have not historically had a material impact on our results of operations and we have no reason to believe that attempts by hackers such as those described above have negatively impacted our it infrastructure operations confidential information or intellectual property however there is risk that these types of activities will recur and persist that one or more of them may be successful in the future that one or more of them may have been or will be successful but not detected prevented remediated or mitigated by us and the costs to us to eliminate detect prevent remediate mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could adversely impact our future results of operations reliance on third partiesour future results depend in part on our relationships with key suppliers strategic partners and other third parties our development marketing and distribution strategies depend in part on our ability to form strategic alliances with third parties that have complementary products software services and skills our strategic partners include consultants and system integrators software and technology providers and indirect channel distributors in certain countries these relationships create risks beyond our control of our partners changing their business focus entering into strategic alliance with other companies being acquired by our competitors failing to meet performance criteria or improperly using our confidential information if we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with strategic partners our business may be adversely affected thirdparty vendors provide important elements to our solutions if we do not maintain our relationships with these vendors or if these vendors cease to be going concerns interruptions in the supply of our products may result there are some components of our solutions that we purchase from single sources due to price quality technology or other reasons for example we have relied on flextronics as a key single source contract manufacturer for our hardware systems for the last several years in addition we buy silicon computer chips and microprocessors from intel corporation and storage disk systems from netapp inc some components supplied by third parties may be critical to our solutions and several of our suppliers may terminate their agreements with us without cause with  days notice if we were unable to purchase necessary services parts components or products from a particular vendor and had to find an alternative supplier our shipments and deliveries could be delayed also disruption in our supply chain or the need to find alternative suppliers could impact the costs andor timing associated with procuring necessary products components and services in either case our operations could be adversely impacted similarly our suppliers’ products and services have certain dependencies with respect to their own supply chain networks and supply issues among our suppliers’ suppliers may also adversely impact our business  table of contents in addition smaller suppliers have operating risks that could impact our business these risks could create product time delays inventory and invoicing problems staging delays and other operational difficulties we could also be impacted by their inability to provide highquality products or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements which could negatively impact our business and operating results reliance on the intellectual property of third partiesthe loss of our rights to use software licensed to us by third parties could harm our business we have an active partner program that offers rights to sublicense third party software as part of a complete suite of solutions for our customers this offering as well as our reliance on third party software and licenses in our operating system software and business creates risks that are not present when developing software inhouse for example the viability reliability and quality of such partners’ businesses as well as their ability to fulfill their obligations to us are factors that come into play and could adversely affect our financial condition our operations could also be impacted if we are forced to seek alternative technology or technology for new solutions that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms also many of our offerings are complemented by technologies developed by others and if we are unable to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies at competitive prices our business could be impacted intellectual propertyif we are unable to develop preserve and protect our intellectual property assets our operating results may be adversely affected as a technology company our intellectual property portfolio is crucial to our continuing ability to be a leading analytic solutions provider we strive to protect and enhance our proprietary intellectual property rights through patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through technological safeguards these efforts include protection of the products and application diagnostic and other software we develop to the extent we are not successful our business could be materially adversely impacted we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization or independently developing technology that is similar to ours particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us such as iran china and certain european eastern bloc countries who may use nssapc to advance their own industries with respect to our pending patent applications we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims and our competitors may already have applied for patents that once issued will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products while we take steps to provide for confidentiality obligations of employees and third parties with whom we do business including customers suppliers and strategic partners there is a risk that such parties will breach such obligations and jeopardize our intellectual property rights many customers have outsourced the administration and management of their data warehouses to third parties including some of our competitors who then have access to our confidential information although we have agreements in place to mitigate this risk there can be no assurance that such protections will be sufficient in addition our ability to capture and reuse fieldbased developed intellectual property is important to future business opportunities and margins we are actively engaged in efforts to protect the value of our intellectual property and to prevent others from infringing our intellectual property rights however due to the complex and technical nature of such efforts and the potentially high stakes involved such enforcement activity can be expensive and time consuming and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts research and developmentwe make significant investments in research and development and cannot assure that these investments will be profitable as part of our business strategy we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain and advance our competitive position including our initiatives to provide our offerings for cloud environments however we may not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our discretionary fixed costs we believe these new technologies could significantly improve our products and services over the longterm however if we have invested inappropriately our results of operations could be adversely affected  table of contents intellectual property infringement claims by third partiesclaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition we have seen a trend towards aggressive enforcement of intellectual property rights as the functionality of products in our industry increasingly overlaps and the volume of issued software patents continues to grow as a result there is a risk that we could be subject to infringement claims which regardless of their validity could • be expensive time consuming and divert management attention away from normal business operations • require us to pay monetary damages or enter into nonstandard royalty and licensing agreements • require us to modify our product sales and development plans or • require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers regardless of whether these claims have any merit they can be burdensome to defend or settle and can harm our business and reputation open source softwarethe growing market acceptance of open source software and lower cost alternatives present challenges for our industry we have developed a version of the teradata database software to operate on open source and alternative platforms and have incorporated other types of open source software into our products allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs and expand our solution offerings “open source” software is made widely available by its authors and is licensed for a nominal fee or in some cases at no charge open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software when combined in specific ways with open source software becomes subject to the open source license we take steps to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with or does not incorporate open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to an open source license however few courts have interpreted the open source licenses and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty additionally there are certain open source software applications in the data analytics market that are being offered free of charge or for a nominal fee open source software offerings available in the marketplace such as hadoop and others can place additional competitive pressure on teradata even though we believe our offerings are unique and add value through software enhancements and services and we may have difficulty in marketing our products to certain customers against available open source options international operationsgenerating substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps us to meet our strategic goals but poses a number of risks in  the percentage of our total revenues from outside of the us was  we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations  eg  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and deteriorating economic environments or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties however our ability to sell our solutions internationally is subject to the following risks among others • general economic and political conditions in each country that could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets • currency exchange rate fluctuations that could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses • the impact of civil and political unrest relating to war terrorist activity or other turmoil on the economy or markets in general or on our ability or that of our suppliers to meet commitments which may occur in other countries where we have significant operations • changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations that may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets • cultural and management challenges with managing new and growing consulting services and engineering functions overseas in developing countries • difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices and the increased travel infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations  table of contents • longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable • tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment • costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages • the impact of catastrophic weather or other negative effects of climate change on our facilities operations andor workforce as well as those of our customers supply chains and distribution channels throughout the world particularly those in coastal areas and • changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets our products are subject to us export controls and when exported from the us or reexported to another country must be authorized under applicable us export regulations changes in our products or changes in export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or in some cases prevent the export of our products to certain countries or customers altogether any change in export regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations foreign currencyour revenue and operating income are subject to variability due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar we have exposure to more than  functional currencies the primary foreign currencies to which we are exposed include the euro british pound japanese yen the australian dollar the canadian dollar and other asian and south american currencies a significant portion of our revenue and operating income is generated outside the us and therefore our financial results may fluctuate due to the effects of such foreign currency fluctuations which are difficult to predict for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency teradata sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established in addition currency variations can affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us risks relating to the referendum of the united kingdom’s membership of the european union   on june   the united kingdom the “uk” held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union the “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results the announcement of brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows dependence on key employeeswe depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees our employees are critical to our success our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of senior management and key personnel in all functional areas of our company including engineering and development marketing and sales professionals and consultants competition for highly skilled personnel in the it industry is intense no assurance can be made that key personnel will remain with us and it may be difficult and costly to replace such employees our failure to hire retain and replace our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business operations internal controlsinadequate internal control over financial reporting and accounting practices could lead to errors which could adversely impact our ability to assure timely and accurate financial reporting  table of contents internal control over financial reporting no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control objectives will be met these inherent limitations include system errors the potential for human error and unauthorized actions of employees or contractors inadequacy of controls temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight or resources and other factors consequently such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under sec and new york stock exchange “nyse” rules which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances and it is necessary to replace upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time in addition unforeseen risks may arise in connection with financial reporting systems due to inefficient business processes business process reengineering projects or changes in accounting standards if management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment material weaknesses could occur causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information this could lead to a decline in our stock price limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures legal contingencies and regulatory matterslike other technology companies we face uncertainties with regard to lawsuits regulations and other related matters in the normal course of business we are subject to proceedings lawsuits claims and other matters including those that relate to the environment health and safety employee benefits export compliance intellectual property and other regulatory compliance and general matters see “note —commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report because such matters are subject to many uncertainties their outcomes are not predictable while we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results in addition we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations including those relating to corporate governance public disclosure and reporting which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future from time to time we may conduct internal investigations in connection with our efforts to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations the costs or results of which could impact our financial results in addition we may be subject to unexpected costs in connection with new public disclosure or other regulatory requirements that are issued from time to time laws and regulations impacting our customers such as those relating to privacy data protection and digital marketing could also impact our future business because we do business in the government sector we are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil or criminal fines penalties or administrative sanctions including debarment from future government business which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition in addition our facilities and operations including former facilities and former operations for which we may have liabilities are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws there have not been any known actual material effects that compliance with environmental provisions has had upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company or its subsidiaries and there are no material estimated capital expenditures for environmental remediation or liabilities planned however we do expect to incur some costs in connection with compliance with these matters and given the uncertainties inherent in such activities there can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not adversely impact future operating results there is active enforcement and ongoing focus by the sec and other governmental authorities on the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of  the “bribery act” and similar antibribery anticorruption laws in other countries given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees despite our high ethics governance and compliance standards which could put the company at risk regarding possible violations of such laws including the fcpa or the bribery act management time and resources are spent to understand and comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to such matters as corporate governance accounting principles public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of  sec regulations basel iii and the rules of the nyse where our shares are listed although we  table of contents do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations rapid changes in accounting standards and federal securities laws and regulations among others may substantially increase costs to our organization challenge our ability to timely comply with all of them and could have an impact on our future operating results our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our financial flexibility   the companys indebtedness could • expose us to interest rate risk since our indebtedness is at variable rates • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions • limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing at attractive rates • require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and other general corporate purposes • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry and • place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  further our outstanding indebtedness is subject to financial and other covenants which may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness we may be in default under the loan which may entitle the lenders to accelerate the debt obligations in order to avoid defaulting on our indebtedness we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity

read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k “annual report” this annual report contains certain statements that are forwardlooking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  certain statements contained in the mda are forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed

onpremises or in the cloud as a service  financial overview as more fully discussed in later sections of this mda the following are the financial highlights for   • revenue decreased  in  from  to  million  the yearoveryear revenue comparison was negatively impacted by  percentage point from foreign currency fluctuations and the sale of the marketing applications business in  • gross margin was  in   up from  in   which was largely due to improved deal mix and product mix • operating income was  million in   up from operating loss of  million in   the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to more significant impairments of goodwill and acquired intangibles in  than  as well as a decrease in operating expenses • net income of  million in  versus a net loss of  million in   net income

contents strategic overview teradata’s strategy is based around our core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies we empower companies to achieve highimpact business outcomes through scalable analytics on an agile data foundation through our focus on leading with business outcomes and a consultative approach our goal is to serve as a trusted advisor to both the business and technical leaders in our customers’ organizations our business analytics solutions are ideally suited for the world’s largest companies who have the most complex analytics requirements and the need to scale our strategy is to provide a differentiated set of offerings to this target market through the following portfolio of solutions including the following • hybrid cloud  leading technology and services to deliver an analytic ecosystem deployed in a hybrid cloud architecture including offerings such as managed cloud private cloud public cloud and on premises software and hardware • business analytics solutions  deliver highvalue business outcomes realized by engaging with business users through solutionbased selling that leverages analytic consulting and repeatable analytical intellectual property ip • ecosystem architecture consulting  bestinclass architecture consulting expertise to help customers build optimized analytical ecosystems independent of technology leveraging both open source and commercial solutions and we deliver our solutions onpremises via the cloud and as a service offering customers choice in how they deploy a teradata analytics environment and leverage the power of our solutions these flexible delivery options are designed to extend our market opportunity in support of our strategy we plan to optimize our gotomarket and sales approach to improve effectiveness in demand creation and address new and expanded market opportunities such as with our consultative business solutions and cloud offerings we will continue investing in partnerships to increase the number of solutions available on teradata platforms maximize customer value and increase our market coverage we believe that our more consultative solutionselling approach and portfolio of offerings that support customers’ choice in procuring and deploying analytics will best position us to be our customers’ trusted advisor and partner of choice for architecting implementing and managing their analytic solutions in summary our longterm strategic objectives are to • deliver business outcomes for our customers through technologyenabled analytics at scale • by focusing on companies with the largest analytic opportunities • by offering marketleading hybrid cloud technology • that is enabled by a world class gotomarket sales and support team • with the ultimate goal of generating revenue earnings and cash flow growth future trends we believe that future demand for our analytic solutions will increase based on the growth of new high volume data sources such as sensor and machinegenerated data and based on data and analytics enabled use cases in areas such as seismicexploration genomics and biological research connected cars and smart cities analytic environments are becoming more complex to design and manage as there are increasing types of analytic tools and techniques multiple data management systems both onpremises and in the cloud commercial and open source technologies to be integrated varying service level requirements and the growth and volume of data this  table of contents complexity drives the need for an overall architecture to manage such environments demand for valueadded consulting and services is growing as customers seek help with evolving their analytic architectures rapidly deploying their analytic architectural solutions and increasingly look to purchase analytic capabilities “as a service overall analytics are growing in importance as global businesses seek new means to drive business value from the everincreasing amounts and types of data as a result we expect that teradata’s leadership status and investments in our strategic areas of focus will position us for future growth this growth however is not expected to be without its challenges from general economic conditions competitive pressures alternative technologies and other risks and uncertainties over the past few years we have seen a shift in the market that included a reduction in customers’ large capital investments in traditional data analytic systems and related services specifically customers have been focusing investments in their analytical ecosystems on products which have lower average selling prices than traditional integrated data warehouse idw environments and changing their buying behavior with decisions shifting from it to business users who typically want operating expense purchasing options as a result our revenue has been impacted by our customers’ focus on less capital intensive options like cloud subscriptionbased licenses rental and usagebased models in addition an increasing percentage of our customers want to buy easytouse vendor managed online delivery “asaservice” analytics rather than analytic systems currently we believe that the greatest challenge for future revenue growth relates to our ability to adapt and respond to this market shift with respect to the way customers want to purchase and deploy analytic technologies overall we believe that the idw will remain a critical part of companies’ analytical ecosystems and teradata’s technology is highly differentiated with our ability to handle the concurrency and service level agreements of hundreds to thousands of missioncritical users and applications further we believe the company has the opportunity for continued revenue growth from both the expansion of our existing customers’ analytical ecosystems as well as the addition of new customers teradata has expanded our offerings as well as our pricing options to make it easier for customers to buy and expand with teradata including flexible offerings including availability in the cloud and over time pricing programs there is risk that pricing and competitive pressures on our solutions could increase in the future as major customers evaluate and rationalize their analytics infrastructure particularly to the extent that cost becomes the top focus and lowercostlower performing alternatives are more seriously and frequently considered however such alternatives generally do not enable companies to perform missioncritical complex analytic workloads to address customers needed business outcomes from largescale analytics discovery analytics and data management such as those enabled by teradata’s portfolio of offerings as the market continues to evolve we will be challenged to generate revenue growth shorter term as customers purchase in smaller deal sizes and more of our customers shift from upfront perpetual licenses to over time models at a pace which is difficult to predict as described above we are also transforming our gotomarket approach to better position teradata with both business buyers and it buyers and to expand with our existing customers as well as add more customers to meet this objective we will focus on execution and monitoring our progress with respect to this evolution as well as working to infuse talent into our organization with key skill sets to support our strategy we continue to believe that analytics will remain a high priority for companies and longer term will drive growth for teradata’s leading solutions moreover we continue to be committed to new product development and achieving a positive yield from our research and development spending and resources which are intended to drive future demand in addition we will continue to optimize our gotomarket structure to focus on the greatest analytic opportunities and to manage our cost structure as we work to broaden our product and consulting services portfolios and market penetration as a portion of the company’s operations and revenue occur outside the united states us and in currencies other than the us dollar the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates based on currency rates as of january   teradata is expecting one point of negative impact from currency translation on our full year projected revenue growth rate  table of contents business transformation teradata continues to advance in the execution of its business transformation plan to return the company to profitable growth as described above we are strengthening our consultative approach to selling data analytics that enable highimpact business outcomes for our customers and extend our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions we are also realigning our gotomarket approach to improve sales effectiveness and achieve better financial results we will continue to invest and prioritize initiatives that strengthen our ability to be our customers’ trusted advisor for data and analytics in addition our broadreaching transformation is intended to drive change across our company including in the following key areas • cloud  we plan to continue to expand our data warehouse offerings in the public cloud and in teradata’s managed cloud environments with our teradata everywhere initiative we offer our customers greater flexibility and agility through the same teradata database that we offer on premises now in a managed cloud public cloud or private cloud environment teradata everywhere is designed to speed time to value save costs and encourage analytics use throughout the organization we are building new services for cloud migration as well as for design implementation and management of cloud and hybrid cloud environments • onpremises data warehouse  we have introduced methods to make it easier to buy expand and seamlessly upgrade data warehouses we expect that our intelliflex platform architecture released in early  will provide more flexible configurations and seamless expansions of our customers’ idw environments and that the softwareonly version of our teradata database will allow us to expand with both new and existing customers • analytical ecosystem  we are adding to our data load and integration software and service offerings capabilities that manage customers analytical ecosystems with new products such as teradata unitytm querygridtm and listenertm these offerings help connect and manage the customers ecosystems to help manage and extract value from their data we expect the mix of our revenues to shift toward cloud analytical ecosystem and analytic consulting services over time as these are faster growing markets which we believe will help increase our recurring revenue over time another element that is critical to teradatas successful transformation plan is modifying our gotomarket efforts to a more consultative approach to better address the increasing relevance of business buyers and to help customers build analytical ecosystems that include our own technologies as well as open source and other commercial solutions we have actions underway to adjust our gotomarket efforts to address these new approaches and to align with the way we believe that our customers want to buy data analytics solutions we have reviewed and rationalized the companys expense structure and are now moving from a cost reduction initiative to a cost management approach as we invest for teradata’s future including investments to support our cloudbased initiatives analytical solutions realignment of our gotomarket approach and modernizing our infrastructure one of teradata’s key strategic initiatives is to enable analytics for companies by making it easier to buy and easier to grow from traditional onpremises deployments to hybrid cloud solutions these hybrid solutions offer simplified and consistent approaches with operating expense alternatives in addition to traditional capital intensive outlays this strategy should accelerate our move away from traditional upfront revenue sales and deployment models to a model where revenue is recognized over time as a result the company’s revenue could decline in the shortterm as customers transition to these purchasing models therefore teradata is introducing additional financial and performance measures to allow for greater transparency regarding the progress we are making toward achieving our strategic objectives these new financial and performance measures currently include the following • tcore growth  a measure of consumption of the teradata database solution it is based on the performance of a system as calculated by number of cores reduced by an inputoutput io factor recognizing that an io starved central processing unit cpu will not provide optimum performance    table of contents • annual recurring revenue arr  is the annual value at a point in time of all of our recurring contracts including support software upgrade rights subscription licenses rental and cloud • recurring revenue as a  of total revenue  revenue from all recurring contracts including support software upgrade rights subscription licenses rental and cloud divided by total company revenue • business consulting revenue growth  revenue growth from our strategic service offerings around analytics consulting business consulting and ecosystem architecture consulting although the revenue from business consulting represents a small percent of total company revenue it is a leading indicator of future tcore growth and measures our effectiveness of becoming a “trusted advisor” within our customers and targeted prospects results from operations for the years ended december    and

total revenue decreased  in  as compared to  the revenue decrease included a  adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations the revenue decline was primarily due to customers increasingly opting for subscriptionbased term licenses rental of hardware and cloud adoption this has an impact on the amount of revenue that is booked upfront versus over the term of the contract in addition the sale of the marketing applications business which generated  million in revenue in  before the sale on july   compared to  million in  had a negative impact on total revenue of  product revenue decreased  in  from  primarily due to customers increasingly opting for our subscriptionbased purchase options service revenue decreased  in  from  with an underlying  decrease in consulting services revenue and

a  adverse impact on services revenue in  total revenue decreased  as compared to  the revenue decrease included a  adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations the revenue decline was due primarily to constrained information technology budgets extended sales cycles and a reduction in large customer orders as well as the impact currency translation had on reported revenue growth product revenue decreased  in  from  primarily due to a decrease in customers large capital expenditures and foreign currency fluctuations which had a  adverse impact on product revenue service revenue decreased  in  from  with an underlying  decrease in consulting services revenue and  increase in maintenance services revenue compared to  services revenue declined due to foreign currency fluctuations which had a  adverse impact on services revenue gross margin the company often uses specific termsdefinitions to describe variances in gross margin the terms and definitions most often used are as follows • revenue mix  the proportion of products and services that generates the total revenue of the company changes in revenue mix can have an impact on gross margin even if total revenue remains unchanged • services mix  the proportion of highermargin maintenance revenue versus lowermargin consulting revenue that generates the total services revenue of the company • product mix  the proportion of various products that generate the total product revenue of the company for example a higher mix of idw products versus departmental data mart aster our extreme data  table of contents appliance or hadoop products would have a positive impact on product gross margins this definition also includes the mix of company sourced and third party products • deal mix  refers to the type of transactions closed within the period and includes such transactions as capacity on demand “cod” floor sweeps versus capacity additions enterprise license agreements ela hardware versus software and discounting new customers versus existing customers large customers versus smaller customers ◦ cod is a common offering used by teradata and other information technology vendors that allows the customer to purchase extra capacity in the future which is already delivered and integrated into their existing systems typically within  months cod enables customers to activate or add capacity quickly product cost is recognized upon delivery with no corresponding revenue when customers activate the cod we record and recognize the revenue associated with the added capacity and the gross margin is recovered ◦ floor sweeps take place when an existing customer replaces their older teradata platform with a new teradata platform which can result in a large revenue transaction but typically also results in a higher mix of lowermargin hardware revenue versus highermargin software revenue ◦ ela transactions allow customers to purchase as much software as needed for current production use for a period of time in exchange for a fixed fee that is typically recognized as revenue upfront or as payments become due if the terms of the payments are extended additional capacity during the term results in lowermargin hardware revenue versus highermargin software revenue gross margin for the following years ended december  was as follows        of        of        of in

liquidity and capital resources teradata ended  with   million in cash and cash equivalents a   million increase from the december   balance after using approximately  million for repurchases of company common stock and approximately  million for acquisitions and investment activities which were completed during the year cash provided by operating activities increased by  million to  million in   the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable changes in net working capital primarily due to a larger collection of receivables as compared to the prior year teradata’s management uses a nongaap measure called “free cash flow” which is not a measure defined under gaap we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software as one measure of assessing the financial performance of the company and this may differ from the definition used by other companies the components that are used to calculate free cash flow are gaap measures taken directly from the consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow information is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations in particular free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for among other things investments in the company’s existing businesses strategic acquisitions and repurchase of teradata common stock free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure this nongaap measure should not be considered a substitute for or superior to cash flows from operating activities under gaap the table below shows net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures for the following periods   in millions        net cash provided by operating activities           less           expenditures for property and equipment           additions to capitalized software           free cash flow           financing activities and certain other investing activities are not included in our calculation of free cash flow in  and   these other investing activities primarily consisted of immaterial complementary business acquisitions and equity investment activities that were closed during these years along with the sale of the marketing applications business on july   teradata’s financing activities for the years ended december   primarily consisted of cash outflows of  million for share repurchases repayments of credit facility borrowings of  million repayment of existing

price per share of  in  and  million shares at an average price per share of  in  share repurchases were made under two share repurchase programs initially authorized by our board of directors in  the first program the “dilution offset program” authorizes the company to repurchase teradata common stock to the extent of cash received from the exercise of stock options and the teradata employee stock purchase plan “espp” to offset dilution from shares issued pursuant to these plans on february   the board approved a new  million share repurchase authorization to replace a prior  million authorization the “general share repurchase program” that was to expire on february   since february  teradata’s board of directors has approved in  million increments additional share repurchase authorizations for a total of  billion under the company’s general share repurchase program on each of the following dates december  table of contents   october   may   december   and may   an additional share repurchase authorization of  million was approved by the board on august   as of december    the company had  million of authorization remaining to repurchase outstanding shares of teradata common stock under the general share repurchase program share repurchases made by the company are reported on a trade date basis our share repurchase activity depends on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for capital investments our stock price and economic and market conditions as well as merger and acquisition opportunities proceeds from the espp and the

 million as of december    under current tax laws and regulations if cash and cash equivalents held outside the us are distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and potential foreign withholding taxes as of december   we have not provided for the us federal tax liability on approximately  billion of foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside of the us on march   teradata replaced its existing fiveyear  million revolving credit facility with a new  million revolving credit facility the “credit facility” the credit facility ends on march   at which point any remaining outstanding borrowings would be due for repayment unless extended by agreement of the parties for up to two additional oneyear periods the interest rate charged on borrowings pursuant to the credit facility can vary depending on the interest rate option the company chooses to utilize and the company’s leverage ratio at the time of the borrowing in   teradata chose a floating rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” the credit facility is unsecured and contains certain representations and warranties conditions affirmative negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for such facilities as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings on the credit facility leaving  million in additional borrowing capacity available the company was in compliance with all covenants as of december    also on march   teradata closed on a new senior unsecured  million fiveyear term loan the proceeds of which were used to pay off the remaining  million of principal on its existing term loan pay off the  million outstanding balance on the prior credit facility and fund share repurchases the  million term loan is payable in quarterly installments which commenced on march   with all remaining principal due in march  the outstanding principal amount under the term loan agreement bears interest at a floating rate based upon a negotiated base rate or a eurodollar rate plus in each case a margin based on the leverage ratio of the company as of december    the term loan principal outstanding was  million and carried an interest rate of  the company was in compliance with all covenants as of december   management believes current cash cash flows from operations and the  million available under the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy future working capital research and development activities capital expenditures pension contributions severance benefits and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months the company principally holds its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits and highlyrated money market funds the company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions competitive pressures and other business and risk factors described elsewhere in this annual report if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or otherwise to comply with the terms of the credit facility and term loan agreement the company may be required to seek additional financing alternatives  table of contents contractual and other commercial commitments in the normal course of business we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity the following table and discussion outlines our material obligations at december    with projected cash payments in the periods shown   total              and in millions amounts            thereafter principal payments on longterm debt                  — interest payments on longterm debt             — lease obligations              purchase obligations             — total debt lease and purchase obligations                   our principal payments on longterm debt represent the expected cash payments on our  million term loan and do not include any fair value adjustments or discounts and premiums our interest payments on longterm debt represent the estimated cash interest payments based on the prevailing interest rate as of december    as of december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility leaving  million in additional borrowing capacity available our lease obligations in the above table include company facilities in various domestic and international locations purchase obligations are committed purchase orders and other contractual commitments for goods and services and include noncancelable contractual payments for fixed or minimum amounts to be purchased in relation to service agreements with various vendors for ongoing telecommunications information technology hosting and other services additionally the company has  million in total uncertain tax positions recorded as noncurrent liabilities on its balance sheet as of december    these items are not included in the table of obligations shown above the settlement period for the noncurrent income tax liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing and the amount of the payments if any will depend on possible future tax examinations with the various tax authorities however it is not expected that any payments will be due within the next  months we also have product warranties and guarantees to third parties as well as postemployment and international pension obligations that may affect future cash flow these items are not included in the table of obligations shown above product warranties and thirdparty guarantees are described in detail in “note —commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements postemployment and pension obligations are described in detail in “note —employee benefit plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements offbalance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of these financial statements we are required to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities these assumptions estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment our critical accounting policies are those that require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances our management periodically reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct  table of contents in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result the significant accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below teradata’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of teradata’s board of directors for additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap see “note —description of business basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements requires judgment including a review of specific contracts past experience creditworthiness of customers international laws and other factors specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting we must also apply judgment in determining all deliverables of the arrangement and in determining the relative selling price of each deliverable considering the price charged for each product when sold on a standalone basis and applicable renewal rates for services changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods the company reviews the relative selling price on a periodic basis and updates it when appropriate to ensure that the practices employed reflect the company’s recent pricing experience the company maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates which includes review and approval by the company’s management for the year ended december   there was no material impact to revenue resulting from changes in the relative selling price nor does the company expect a material impact from such changes in the near term capitalized software costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product that will be sold leased or otherwise marketed are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established technological feasibility is established when planning designing and initial coding activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications are complete in the absence of a detailed program design or for agile development activities a working model is used to establish technological feasibility once technological feasibility is established all development costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established the timing of when various research and development projects become technologically feasible or ready for release can cause fluctuations in the amount of research and development costs that are expensed or capitalized in any given period thus impacting our reported profitability for that period in the fourth quarter of  the company began moving towards more frequent releases of its products which significantly shortens the opportunity to capitalize software development costs our research and development efforts have become more driven by market requirements and rapidly changing customers needs in addition the company started applying agile development methodologies to help respond to new technologies and trends agile development methodologies are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent and iterative revisions to a product releases features and functions as the software is being developed due to the shorter development cycle and focus on rapid production associated with agile development the company does not anticipate capitalizing significant amounts of external use software development costs in future periods due to the relatively short duration between the completion of the working model and the point at which a product is ready for general release prior capitalized costs will continue to be amortized under the greater of revenuebased or straightline method over the estimated useful life income taxes in accounting for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities the deferred tax assets and liabilities  table of contents are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized the company’s intention is to permanently reinvest its foreign earnings outside of the us as a result the effective tax rates are largely based upon the pretax earnings mix and allocation of certain expenses in various taxing jurisdictions where the company conducts its business these jurisdictions apply a broad range of statutory income tax rates the us statutory corporate income tax rate is currently  as compared to the overall statutory effective tax rate of our various foreign jurisdictions of approximately  as of december    the company has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of approximately  billion from its foreign subsidiaries we account for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing thresholds and attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position we record any interest andor penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line on our consolidated statements of income as of december    the company has a total of  million of unrecognized tax benefits of which  million is included in the other liabilities section of the company’s consolidated balance sheet as a noncurrent liability the remaining balance of  million of uncertain tax positions relates to certain tax attributes both generated by the company and acquired in various acquisitions which are netted against the underlying deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized we recorded  million in  and  million in  for valuation allowances due to a change in tax law enacted in the state of california in the fourth quarter of  the company established a valuation allowance to partially offset its california rd tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset as the company expects to continue to generate excess california rd tax credits into the foreseeable future stockbased compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for which awards are expected to vest we utilize pricing models including the blackscholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of stockbased compensation at the date of grant these valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including expected volatility and expected term in addition we issue performancebased awards that vest only if specific performance conditions are satisfied the number of shares that will be earned can vary based on actual performance no shares will vest if the threshold objectives are not met in the event the objectives are exceeded additional shares will vest up to a maximum payout the cost of these awards is expensed over the performance period based upon management’s estimate and analysis of the probability of meeting the performance criteria because the actual number of shares to be awarded is not known until the end of the performance period the actual compensation expense related to these awards could differ from our current expectations goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable the company tests goodwill by first performing a qualitative analysis step  to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic market and industry conditions and overall financial performance of the reporting unit if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value after assessing these qualitative factors then the guidance on goodwill impairment requires the company to perform a twostep impairment test in the first step the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value the company typically determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income and market approaches under the income approach the company calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and  table of contents earnings derived from comparable companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination the implied fair value of the goodwill in step two analysis is determined by the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations which requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities and to allocate the fair value between net assets and goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference teradata reviewed two reporting units in its  goodwill impairment assessment as each operating segment was deemed as a reporting unit for purposes of testing based on the companys evaluation and weighting of the events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent step  test the company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was below its carrying value therefore the company determined that it was not necessary to perform a step  goodwill impairment test for the reporting units in  see “note —goodwill and acquired intangible assets for additional information the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate any excess purchase price consideration between net assets and goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets determining the fair value of goodwill and acquired intangibles is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows discount rates and future economic and market conditions the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which may not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur pension and postemployment benefits we measure pension and postemployment benefit costs and credits using actuarial valuations actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans these factors include assumptions we make about interest rates expected investment return on plan assets total and involuntary turnover rates and rates of future compensation increases in addition our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations we review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing

by reference  table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the company’s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro the british pound the japanese yen the australian dollar the canadian dollar and other asian and south american currencies exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of twelve months or less the potential loss in fair value at december   for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical  adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately  million this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures for additional information regarding the company’s foreign currency hedging strategy see “note — derivative instruments and hedging activities” in the notes to consolidated

note  description of business basis of presentation and significant accounting policies description of the business teradata corporation “teradata” or the “company” is a global leader in analytic data platforms analytic applications and related services the company’s analytic data platforms are comprised of software hardware and related business consulting and support services for data warehousing and big data analytics basis of presentation the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported on an ongoing basis management evaluates these estimates and judgments including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts the valuation of inventory to net realizable value impairments of goodwill and other intangibles stockbased compensation pension and other postemployment benefits and income taxes and any changes will be accounted for on a prospective basis actual results could differ from those estimates revenue recognition teradata’s solution offerings typically include software unspecified whenandifavailable upgrades hardware maintenance support services and other consulting implementation and installationrelated “consulting” services teradata records revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned teradata considers these requirements met when • persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists • the products or services have been delivered to the customer • the sales price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties • collectibility is reasonably assured teradata reports revenue net of any taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions the company assesses whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale standard payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed but are generally between  days and  days payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on a successful collection history on such arrangements and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition teradata delivers its solutions primarily through direct sales channels as well as through alliances with system integrators other independent software vendors and distributors and valueadded resellers collectively referred to as “resellers” in assessing whether the sales price to a reseller is fixed or determinable the company considers among other things past business practices with the reseller the reseller’s operating history payment terms return rights and the financial wherewithal of the reseller when teradata determines that the contract fee to a reseller is not fixed or determinable that transaction is deferred and recognized upon sellthrough to the end customer the company’s deliverables often involve delivery or performance at different periods of time revenue for software is generally recognized upon delivery with the hardware once title and risk of loss have been transferred revenue for unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a whenandifavailable basis are recognized straightline over the term of the arrangement revenue for maintenance support services is also recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the contract revenue for other consulting implementation and installation services is recognized as services are provided in certain instances acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer in such cases revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria have been met delivery and acceptance generally occur in the same reporting period the company’s arrangements generally do not include any customer negotiated provisions for cancellation termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue the company evaluates all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and if the contract  table of contents includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of teradata most of the company’s products and services qualify as separate units of accounting and are recognized upon meeting the criteria as described above for multiple deliverable arrangements that contain nonsoftware related deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based upon the relative selling price hierarchy and if software and softwarerelated deliverables are also included in the arrangement to those deliverables as a group based on the best estimate of selling price “besp” for the group the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” if vsoe is not available or besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the company then recognizes revenue when the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met for each deliverable for the software group or arrangements that contain only software and softwarerelated deliverables the revenue is allocated utilizing the residual or fair value method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance and the remaining portion of the software arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue the fair value method is similar to the relative selling price method used for nonsoftware deliverables except that the allocation of each deliverable is based on vsoe for software groups or arrangements that contain only software and softwarerelated deliverables in which vsoe does not exist for each deliverable fair value method or does not exist for each undelivered element residual method revenue for the entire software arrangement or group is deferred and not recognized until delivery of all elements without vsoe has occurred unless the only undelivered element is postcontract customer support “pcs” in which case the entire software arrangement or group is recognized ratably over the pcs period teradata’s analytic database software and hardware products are sold and delivered together in the form of a “node” of capacity as an integrated technology solution because both the analytic database software and hardware platform are necessary to deliver the analytic data platform’s essential functionality the database software and hardware node are excluded from the software rules and considered a nonsoftware related deliverable teradata software applications and related support are considered softwarerelated deliverables additionally the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered items utilizing the relative selling price or fair value method is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions the noncontingent amount vsoe is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately teradata uses the stated renewal rate approach in establishing vsoe for maintenance and whenandifavailable upgrades collectively referred to as pcs under this approach the company assesses whether the contractually stated renewal rates are substantive and consistent with the company’s normal pricing practices renewal rates greater than the lower level of our targeted pricing ranges are considered to be substantive and therefore meet the requirements to support vsoe in instances where there is not a substantive renewal rate in the arrangement the company allocates revenue based upon besp using the minimum established pricing targets as supported by the renewal rates for similar customers utilizing the bellcurve method teradata also offers consulting and installationrelated services to its customers which are considered nonsoftware deliverables if they relate to the nodes these services are rarely considered essential to the functionality of the data warehouse solution deliverable and there is never software customization of the proprietary database software vsoe for consulting services is based on the hourly rates for standalone consulting services projects by geographic region and are indicative of the company’s customary pricing practices pricing in each market is structured to obtain a reasonable margin based on input costs in nearly all multipledeliverable arrangements the company is unable to establish vsoe for all deliverables in the arrangement this is due to infrequently selling each deliverable separately such is the case with our nodes not pricing products or services within a narrow range or only having a limited sales history when vsoe cannot be established attempts are made to establish tpe of the selling price for each deliverable tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately however teradata’s offerings contain significant differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot typically be obtained this is because teradata’s products contain a significant amount of proprietary technology and its solutions offer substantially different features and functionality than other available products as teradata’s products are significantly different from those of its competitors the company is unable to establish tpe for the vast majority of its products  table of contents when the company is unable to establish selling prices using vsoe or tpe the company uses besp in its allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a standalone basis the company determines besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to geographies market conditions product life cycles competitive landscape internal costs gross margin objectives purchase volumes and pricing practices the primary consideration in developing besp for the company’s nodes is the bellcurve method based on historical transactions the besp analysis is at the geography level in order to align it with the way in which the company goes to market and establishes pricing for its products the company has established discount ranges off of published list prices for different geographies based on strategy and maturity of teradata’s presence in the respective geography there are distinctions in each geography and product group which support the use of geographies and markets for the determination of besp for example the company’s us market is relatively mature and most of the large transactions are captured in this market whereas the international markets are less mature with generally smaller deal size additionally the prices and margins for the company’s products vary by geography and by product class besp is analyzed on a semiannual basis using data from the four previous quarters which the company believes best reflects most recent pricing practices in a changing marketplace the company reviews vsoe tpe and its determination of besp on a periodic basis and updates it when appropriate to ensure that the practices employed reflect the company’s recent pricing experience the company maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates which includes review and approval by the company’s management for the year ended december   there was no material impact to revenue resulting from changes in vsoe tpe or besp nor does the company expect a material impact from such changes in the near term teradata’s new gotomarket offerings introduced in the second half of  which are part of the overall business transformation strategy include the following offerings • subscription license  teradata’s subscription licenses include a righttouse license and are typically sold with pcs the revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized ratably over the contract term the term of these arrangements varies between one and five years • software as a service or cloud  these arrangements include a righttoaccess software license that the customer does not have a right to take possession of without significant penalty during the hosting period and the services can be delivered through a managed cloud private cloud or public cloud these arrangements are recognized outside the software rules and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term the term of these arrangements typically varies between one and five years • rentals  teradata owns the equipment and may or may not provide managed services the revenue for these arrangements is generally recognized straightline over the term of the contract the term of these arrangements typically varies between one and three years and are generally accounted for as operating leases • utility model  teradata owns the equipment and may or may not provide managed services utility models typically include a minimum fixed amount that is recognized ratably over the contract term in addition to an elastic amount for usage above the minimum which is recognized monthly based on actual utilization the term of these arrangements varies between one and five years shipping and handling product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products in the consolidated statements of income loss cash and cash equivalents all shortterm highlyliquid investments having original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents allowance for doubtful accounts teradata establishes provisions for doubtful accounts using both percentages of accounts receivable balances to reflect historical average credit losses and specific provisions for known issues inventories

company’s property and equipment for december  was as follows in millions        depreciation expense           capitalized software  direct development costs associated with internaluse software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the resulting software the costs are capitalized when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that computer software being developed will be completed and placed in service teradata typically amortizes capitalized internaluse software on a straightline basis over three years beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use costs incurred for the development of big data and analytic applications are expensed as incurred based on the frequency and agile nature of development prior to december   costs incurred for the development of analytic database software that will be sold leased or otherwise marketed were capitalized between technological feasibility and the point at which a product is ready for general release technological feasibility is established when planning designing and initial coding activities that are necessary to establish the product can be produced to meet its design specifications are complete in the absence of a program design a working model is used to establish technological feasibility these costs are included within capitalized software and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of four years using the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straightline method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product beginning when the product is available for general release costs capitalized include direct labor and related overhead costs costs incurred prior to technological feasibility and after general release are expensed as incurred the following table identifies the activity relating to capitalized software

recorded to cost of sales for external use software is based on capitalized software at december   and does not include any new capitalization for future periods our research and development efforts have recently become more driven by market requirements and rapidly changing customers needs in addition the company started applying agile development methodologies to help respond to new technologies and trends agile development methodologies are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent and iterative revisions to a product release features and functions as the software is being developed due to the shorter development cycle and focus on rapid production associated with  table of contents agile development the company does not anticipate capitalizing significant amounts of external use software development costs in future periods due to the relatively short duration between the completion of the working model and the point at which a product is ready for general release prior capitalized costs will continue to be amortized under the greater of revenuebased or straightline method over the estimated useful life valuation of longlived assets longlived assets such as property and equipment acquired intangible assets and internal capitalized software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill amounts are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment annually or upon occurrence of an event or change in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount see note  goodwill and acquired intangibles for additional information assets and liabilities held for sale the company classifies assets and liabilities disposal groups to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met • management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the disposal group • the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups • an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated • the sale of the disposal group is probable and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year except if events or circumstances beyond the company’s control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year • the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and • actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn the company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met conversely gains are not recognized until the date of sale the company assesses the fair value of a disposal group less costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale the company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group under assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets refer to note  for further information on the company’s assets and liabilities held for sale warranty provisions for product warranties are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized the company accrues warranty reserves using percentages of revenue to reflect the company’s historical average warranty claims research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of the capitalized software development costs discussed above research and development costs primarily include laborrelated costs contractor fees and overhead expenses directly related to research and development support pension and postemployment benefits the company accounts for its pension and postemployment benefit obligations using actuarial models the measurement of plan obligations was made as of december    liabilities are computed using the projected unit credit method the objective under this method is to expense each participant’s benefits under the plan as they accrue taking into consideration salary increases and the plan’s benefit  table of contents allocation formula thus the total pension or postemployment benefit to which each participant is expected to become entitled is broken down into units each associated with a year of past or future credited service the company recognizes the funded status of its pension and postemployment plan obligations in its consolidated balance sheet and records in other comprehensive income certain gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred under pension accounting rules foreign currency assets and liabilities of nonus subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates income and expense accounts are translated at daily exchange rates prevailing during the period adjustments arising from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income income taxes income tax expense is provided based on income before income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which the company conducts its business deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes these deferred taxes are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized teradata recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the company records valuation allowances related to its deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized stockbased compensation stockbased payments to employees including grants of stock options restricted shares and restricted share units are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value the fair value of each stock option award on the grant date is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following assumptions expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility weightedaverage riskfree interest rate and weighted average expected term of the options the company’s expected volatility assumption used in the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on teradatas historical volatility the expected term for options granted is based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees prior to  the expected term assumption was based on the simplified method under gaap which is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each vesting tranche of awards the midpoint between the vesting date and the expiration date was used as the expected term under this method the riskfree interest rate used in the blackscholes model is based on the implied yield curve available on us treasury issues at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the company’s expected term assumption the company has never declared or paid a cash dividend treasury stock prior to the fourth quarter of  when all treasury stock shares were retired shares of the company’s common stock repurchased through the share repurchase programs were held as treasury stock treasury stock was accounted for using the cost method beginning in the fourth quarter of   stock repurchased through the share repurchase programs will be retired upon repurchase the excess repurchase price over the par value is charged to retained earnings earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding during the reported period the calculation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share except that the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding includes the dilution from potential shares added from stock options restricted share awards and other stock awards refer to note  for share information on the company’s stock compensation plans the components of basic and diluted earnings loss per share are as follows    table of contents

n may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance that affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards the new guidance will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in the current revenue recognition guidance and most industryspecific guidance in addition the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement in this update the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services to achieve that core principle the fasb defines a five step process which includes the following  identify the contract with a customer  identify the performance obligations in the contract  determine the transaction price  allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and  recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation in july  the fasb issued a oneyear delay in the effective date of the new standard under this guidance the new revenue standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early application permitted the standard allows entities to apply the standard retrospectively for all periods presented or alternatively an entity is permitted to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance as an opening balance sheet adjustment to retained earnings in the period of initial application in march  the fasb issued an update that amends and clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations for reporting revenue gross rather than net in april  the fasb issued an update that amends and clarifies the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property in may  the fasb issued an update which addresses the narrowscope improvements to the guidance on collectibility noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition additionally the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers all updates issued in  have the same deferred effective date the company plans to adopt the new accounting guidance effective january   the company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows as well as the method of transition that will be used in adopting the standard  table of contents although the company is still evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements including evaluating the different adoption methodologies the company believes the most significant impacts may include the following items • as the company transitions to the new gotomarket offerings such as subscription licenses the company could potentially see a more significant impact in the amount of revenue recognized over time under the current rules but upfront under the new rules • the company currently expenses contract acquisition costs and believes that the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the contract to which the costs relate could have an impact especially as the company transitions to longerterm overtime revenue contracts • the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered items and recognized upfront utilizing the relative selling price model is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions ie the noncontingent amount under current rules under the new rules the amounts allocated to delivered items and recognized upfront could be higher if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur in future periods upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions the company does not expect that the new standard will result in substantive changes in our deliverables or the amounts of revenue allocated between multiple deliverables with the exception of contingent revenue discussed above the company is still in the process of evaluating these impacts and our initial assessment may change as the company continues with implementing new systems processes accounting policies and internal controls leases   in february  the fasb issued new guidance which requires a lessee to account for

financial statements simplifying the measurement for goodwill  in january  the fasb issued guidance to simplify the accounting for the impairment of goodwill the guidance removes step  of the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill the guidance is required to be applied prospectively and is effective for periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted the company expects to early adopt this accounting guidance effective january   the company does not expect any impact from the adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements recently adopted guidance accounting for sharebased payments with performance targets   in june  the fasb issued new guidance that requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition a reporting entity should apply existing guidance as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered the

consolidated financial statements  table of contents stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting   in march  the fasb issued an update which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows the company elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended december   retroactively to january   the impact of early adoption resulted in the following • the new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies shortfalls from vested or settled sharebased awards to be recorded in the provision for income taxes on the income statement rather than in paidin capital this change was applied on a prospective basis as of january   which resulted in additional tax expense of  million for the year ended december   • the tax withholding threshold for triggering liability accounting on a net settlement transaction has been increased from the minimum statutory rate to the maximum this change was applied on a modified retrospective basis as of january   which resulted in no impact to retained earnings as of january   where the cumulative effect of this change is required to be recorded • the company elected to change its accounting policy for forfeitures to record them as they occur the change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of less than  million as of january   • the company no longer reflects the cash received from the excess tax benefits within cash flows from financing activities but instead now reflects this benefit within cash flows from operating activities this change in presentation was applied prospectively as of january   which resulted in an increase in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used by financing activities of  million for the year ended december   • the presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented on our consolidated statement of cash flows since these cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity • the company excluded excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our

deferred us tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the company reflects any interest and penalties recorded in connection with its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense as of december    the company’s uncertain tax positions totaled approximately  million  of which  million

these awards determined to be the fair market value at the date of grant is expensed ratably over the vesting period for substantially all restricted share grants at the date of grant the recipient

subject to restrictions on transferability and risk of forfeiture for both restricted share grants and restricted share units any potential dividend rights would be subject to the same vesting

company determines the expected return on assets based on individual plan asset allocations historical capital market returns and longterm interest rate assumptions with input from its actuaries investment managers and independent investment advisors the company emphasizes longterm expectations in its evaluation of return factors discounting or ignoring shortterm market fluctuations expected asset returns are reviewed annually but are generally modified only when asset allocation strategies change or longterm economic trends are identified the discount rate used to determine yearend  us benefit obligations was derived by matching the plans’ expected future cash flows to the corresponding yields from the citigroup pension liability index this yield curve has been constructed to represent the available yields on highquality fixedincome investments across a broad range of future maturities international discount rates were determined by examining interest rate levels and trends within each country particularly yields on highquality longterm corporate bonds relative to our future expected cash flows gains and losses have resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience including among other items changes in discount rates and differences between actual and assumed asset returns these gains and losses except those differences being amortized to the marketrelated value are only amortized to the extent that they exceed  of the higher of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit

investment strategies across its various international pension plans in some countries particularly where teradata does not have a large employee base the company may use insurance annuity contracts to satisfy its future pension payment obligations whereby the company makes pension plan contributions to an insurance company in exchange for which the pension plan benefits will be paid when the members reach a specified retirement age or on earlier exit of members from the plan in other countries the company may employ local asset managers to manage investment portfolios according to the investment policies and guidelines established by the company and with consideration to individual plan liability structure and local market environment and risk tolerances the company’s investment policies and guidelines primarily emphasize diversification across and within asset classes to maximize longterm returns subject to prudent levels of risk with the overall objective of enabling the plans to meet their future obligations the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixedincome investments furthermore equity investments are diversified across domestic and international stocks small and large capitalization stocks and growth and value stocks fixedincome assets are diversified across government and corporate bonds where applicable real estate investments are made through real estate securities partnership interests or direct investment and are diversified by property type and location cash flows related to employee benefit plans cash contributions the

other than the us dollar the company is exposed to potential gains and losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in an attempt to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactional exposures resulting predominantly from foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables the forward contracts are designated as fair value hedges of specified foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables and generally mature in three months or less the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates the company exposes itself to credit risk the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the applicable contracts all derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value the fair values of foreign exchange contracts are based on market spot and forward exchange rates and represent estimates of possible value that may not be realized in the future changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability are recorded in current period earnings the notional amounts represent agreedupon amounts on which calculations of dollars to be exchanged are based and are an indication of the extent of teradata’s involvement in such instruments these notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and therefore are not a measure of the instruments across its portfolio of contracts teradata has both long and short positions relative to the us dollar as a result teradata’s net involvement is less than the total

in the normal course of business the company is subject to proceedings lawsuits governmental investigations claims and other matters including those that relate to the environment health and safety employee benefits export compliance intellectual property tax matters and other regulatory compliance and general matters guarantees and product warranties guarantees associated with the company’s business activities are reviewed for appropriateness and impact to the company’s financial statements periodically the company’s customers enter into various leasing arrangements coordinated with a leasing company in some instances the company guarantees the leasing company a minimum value at the end of the lease term on the leased equipment as of december    the maximum future payment obligation of this guaranteed value and the associated liability balance was  million  the company provides its customers a standard manufacturer’s warranty and records at the time of the sale a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such as labor rates average repair time travel time number of service calls and cost of replacement parts for each consummated sale the company recognizes the total customer revenue and records the associated warranty liability using preestablished

customers in the form of maintenance contracts the company accounts for these contracts by deferring the related maintenance revenue over the extended andor enhanced coverage period costs associated with maintenance support are expensed as incurred amounts associated with these maintenance contracts are not included in the table above in addition the company provides its customers with certain indemnification rights in general the company agrees to indemnify the customer if a third party asserts patent or other infringement on the part of the customer for its use of the company’s products the company has indemnification obligations under its charter and bylaws to its officers and directors and has entered into indemnification agreements with the officers and directors of its subsidiaries from time to time the company also enters into agreements in connection with its acquisition and divesture activities that include indemnification obligations by the company including the sale of the marketing applications business the fair value of these indemnification obligations is typically not readily determinable due to the conditional nature of the company’s potential obligations and the specific facts and circumstances involved with each particular agreement as such the company has generally not recorded a liability in connection with these  table of contents indemnification arrangements historically payments made by the company under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of

subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments and cash and cash equivalents credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals credit limits selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures teradata’s business often involves large transactions with customers and if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses however management believes that the reserves for potential losses were adequate at december   and   the company is also potentially subject to concentrations of supplier risk our hardware components are assembled exclusively by flextronics international ltd “flextronics” flextronics procures a wide variety of components used in the manufacturing process on our behalf although many of these components are available from multiple sources teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality cost and delivery typically these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes andor facilities to ensure continuity of supply given the company’s strategy to outsource its manufacturing activities to flextronics and to source certain components from single suppliers a disruption in production at flextronics or at a supplier could impact the timing of customer shipments andor teradata’s operating results note  fair value measurements fair value measurements are established utilizing a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  defined as significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in lessactive markets for identical assets and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include money market funds and foreign currency exchange contracts a portion of the company’s excess cash reserves are held in money market funds which generate interest income based on the prevailing market rates money market funds are included in  table of contents cash and cash equivalents in the company’s balance sheet money market fund holdings are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and are classified within level  of the valuation hierarchy when deemed appropriate the company minimizes its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments specifically forward foreign exchange contracts the fair value of these contracts are measured at the end of each interim reporting period using observable inputs other than quoted prices specifically market spot and forward exchange rates as such these derivative instruments are classified within level  of the valuation hierarchy fair value gains for open contracts are recognized as assets and fair value losses are recognized as liabilities the fair value derivative assets and liabilities recorded in other current assets and accrued liabilities at december   and   were not material any realized gains or losses would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures further information on the company’s use of forward foreign exchange contracts is included in

february    table of contents item  form k summary none  exhibit  teradata change in control severance plan as amended and restated january   to be effective as of february   introduction the board of directors of teradata corporation the “ board ” recognizes that from time to time the company may explore potential transactions that could result in a change in control of the company this possibility and the uncertainty it creates may result in the loss or distraction of certain key employees of the company to the detriment of the company and its stockholders the board considers the avoidance of such loss and distraction to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the company and its stockholders the board also believes that when a change in control is perceived as imminent or is occurring the board should be able to receive and rely on disinterested service from employees regarding the best interests of the company and its stockholders without concern that employees might be distracted or concerned by the personal uncertainties and risks created by the perception of an imminent or occurring change in control in addition the board believes that it is consistent with the company’s employment practices and policies and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to treat fairly its employees whose employment terminates in connection with or following a change in control accordingly the board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to assure the company of the continued employment and attention and dedication to duty of its employees and to seek to ensure the availability of their continued service notwithstanding the possibility or occurrence of a change in control therefore in order to fulfill the above purposes the board has caused the company to adopt this teradata change in control severance plan the “ plan ” the plan is intended to comply with the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “ erisa ” and other applicable laws to the extent the separation pay portion of the plan is a pension plan it qualifies for exemption from parts ii iii and iv of erisa as a plan
