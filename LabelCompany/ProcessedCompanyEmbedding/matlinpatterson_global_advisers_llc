blended trading and private equity skills to invest in control opportunities balancing perspectives to realize value among a range of complex situations in approaching control investments matlinpatterson typically employs two approaches accumulating deeply discounted securities and other obligations of distressed companies as a first step toward acquiring a controlling or influential ownership interest generally through the conversion of debt to equity and directly acquiring significant ownership stakes or injecting capital into businesses that are in bankruptcy or in financial distress we manage our investments and businesses actively whether managing our liquid portfolios or private equity investments we are active investors we focus on balance sheet optimization and operational excellence in our control positions—engaging with the company actively throughout the reorganization and ownership process following a successful financial restructuring we focus on stability and building the longterm value of the firm in our ownership role we focus on enhancing human capital providing guidance on strategic and operational issues facilitating ongoing financing and funding the business to bring greater stability as we build value for the firm and our investors leading to a successful exit coalescing around disparate credit experience our team is greater than

turnarounds enhances our ability to capitalize on market inefficiencies additionally our knowledge of the us bankruptcy code insolvency litigation and regulatory environment in key jurisdictions enables us to understand the legal pitfalls that could impact returns on investment risk management must be proactive and dynamic many of the credit market segments in which we invest carry inherent risks associated with a lack of liquidity uncertain cash flows imperfect information and inefficient pricing each portfolio team has a strong focus on risk relative to projected return we utilize several strategies designed to mitigate downside risk associated with credit specific risk market volatility and tail risk each manager also employs strategyspecific risk tools portfolio construction requires broad perspective and big picture thinking while individual investments within portfolios are selected primarily through fundamental bottomup analysis in constructing and managing our
