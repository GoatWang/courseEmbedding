my vocations included tree trimmer steeplejack and tuckpointer tool and die maker and lastly an electrician from which i retired what do nuns do nuns  origin and history  the institution of nuns and sisters who devote themselves in various religious orders to the practice of a life of perfection dates from th…e first ages of the church and women may claim with a certain pride that they were the first to embrace the religious state for its own sake without regard to missionary work and ecclesiastical functions proper to men st paul speaks of widows who were called to certain kinds of church work  timothy  and of virgins  cor vii whom he praises for their continence and their devotion to the things of the lord the virgins were remarkable for their perfect and perpetual chastity which the catholic apologists have extolled as a contrast to pagan corruption st justin apol i c  migne pg vi  st ambrose de virginibus bk i c  migne pl xvi  many also practiced poverty from the earliest times they were called the spouses of christ according to st athanasius the custom of the church apol ad constant sec  migne pg xxv  st cyprian describes a virgin who had broken her vows as an adulteress ep  migne pl iv  tertullian distinguishes between those virgins who took the veil publicly in the assembly of the faithful and others known to god alone the veil seems to have been simply that of married women virgins vowed to the service of god at first continued to live with their families but as early as the end of the third century there were community houses known as partheuones  and certainly at the beginning of the same century the virgins formed a special class in the church receiving holy communion before the laity the office of good friday in which the virgins are mentioned after the porters and the litany of the saints in which they are invoked with the widows shows traces of this classification they were sometimes admitted among the deaconesses for the baptism of adult women and

abbreviated to just m on …tombstones  for example sr m monica gaffney mary being understood the overdraft of marie posed obvious personnel problems male and female names of nun i cannot see any connection with lions so we will tackle your question about nuns i assume you mean female religious i cant explain it but in some religious orders it is …quite common for sisters to take names of male saints and you will have such oddities as sister paul  not paula in some cases basically male names are genderadapted such as sister roberta which is at least feminine and there are also such odd combinations as mary luke which mix genders so to speakl it would appear there are more female saints than male and there would be not problems of a shortage of feminine names i could never entirely understand this practice i knew of a sister saint ignatius obviously named after the jesuit founder this is very strange as there are no jesuit nuns sister st ignatius was of the ihm or immaculate

answered in catholicism what is the name of a nuns uniform a nuns clothes are called her habit edit share to corby di praglia  contributions answered in catholicism why do many nuns take mens names there is no one answer to your question here are a few of the reasons in some communities nuns have been assigned the names that they are known by in religious life this …is an older tradition not as common now as it once was but it is true that some nuns have no say in what their religious idenitities will besometimes especially in past centuries but true even today names were unisex or were pronounced differently for men and women julian is considered today to be a mans name which puzzles some who wonder why julian of norwich had a mans name but in her day the feminineversion of the name was pronounced julianne today the same name is spelled julianne when given to a womanin some cases when the choice has been the nuns a particular name whether male or female is taken simply because the nun has a devotion to that particular saint indeed in some communities there is a communitywide devotion to a particular saint and variations of that saints name is given to all of the members this is why youll sometimes find that entire communities of nuns all have double names that start or end with either mary or joseph the easy answer is tradition a longstanding custom it is true many religious orders to which the nuns belong  there being no lay or unattached sisters were founded by men such as saint francis and st dominic hence franciscans dominicans oddly there are more female than male saints so there is no shortage of religious names without any gender hopping sometimes they will combine male and female names such as a sister martin mary of the ihm  no she did not invert the name of the actress mary martin mary is of course the blessed virgin but martin is a male saint you will also find such combinations as mary luke and more normallike male names adapted to a female role i knew of a sister roberta i suggest you ask about at a local convent or religious book store  they could shed some light on this veiled tradition no pun intended by the way both sister martin

in the tv stand the flying nun retrophilia by scott lydon  years ago it never hit the top ten its often the punchline to a joke and the premise… well nobodys ever dared a remake but its also still in syndication today and even has a loyal fanbase today were peeling open the dark corners of classic television to take a quick peek at the one of the most charmingly goofy ideas for a sitcom ever dreamed up by a studio thats right get ready children because after the jump scotts talking about the flying nun so lets be clear right off the bat there are  episodes of the flying nun and i didnt watch all of them when preparing for this post what i did do was watch sit down and watch the first half of the first season i feel safe talking about the show after that because im pretty sure the flying nun wont throw in some amazing plot twist conversion to islam as a first season cliffhanger just be aware in advance that the scope of my review might be limited     but i have to say and maybe its just stockholm syndrome but after about two hours the flying nun really began to earn my respect the first episode covered the premise pretty well introducing the sweet sister bertrille sally field a young novice whos come to puerto rico to learn how to be a nun of course she has all sorts of groovy phrases that really shake up the other nuns and she quickly offends her mother superior by being well too cool for catholic school   the power of christ compels you   this isnt really anything groundbreaking especially for those of us who survived the s but this next part this is where it gets a little more interesting because sitcoms just arent sitcoms without the romantic male lead or at least thats what hollywood assumes and so meet carlos much like job hes about to be tested by god you see her too right honey   carlos is the first person sister bertrille meets in puerto rico hes a nonreligious gambler who also owns a nightclub and spends his free time trying to score with bikini models this is the sort of lifestyle that really ends badly when a nun suddenly imprints on you and decides to be your special friend   sorry mr hefner i thought the gate was locked   and this is where the writing team really gets to shine we all know the hollywood formula has invented literally thousands of different ways to play will theywont they with the main characters now think about how many shows went bad when the male and female lead hooked up moonlighting xfiles batman the animated series all of them fell apart quickly when the gender tension vanished for good but with a nun that can never ever ever be a problem shes not after his heart shes after his soul its a brand new thing in same old drag baby of course its still sort of creepy how many people in this show act like theyre trying to score with a nun but it was the swingin sixties right that was just how people acted back then   this is exactly how ellen stole anne heche from steve martin   and then theres the flying part for people who havent seen the show how can that nun fly is the secondbiggest question just after are you sure there isnt anything else on tv right now so how do the writers solve this issue is it some mutant power some divine gift from a loving god maybe alien nanites sent back through time nope stop thinking so st century people in  its just plain old physics   when lift plus thrust is greater than load plus drag… well anythingll fly   read that quote again because there it is thats the reason thats why she flies and even when other nuns try to make a big deal out of it and they tell her that shes special sister bertrille stays humble and goes out of her way to stress that its just regular old physics in action this isnt the story of a saint with some weird dr strangestyle magic this is the story of a lightweight lady with a big solid hat on a very windy day the faith presented here relies on a trust in gods greater plan remembering that if he created the universe he created physical laws too i thought this made for a very nice character decision as so many writers forget that pride is also one of the seven deadly sins and the truly pious dont ever hold their blessings over other peoples heads were all only human but such modesty is a nice touch in a show about a nun and even better than that the humble sister bertrille absolutely loves the idea of flying and who wouldnt so she reads aerodynamics textbooks until she can control herself in the air its not some innate talent shes born with its just a skill she has to work to master admittedly totally off camera but one can only ask so much from  and that makes her more tony stark than clark kent there are times when she flies without wanting to fly there are even a few times when she wants to but cant get enough lift and so ends up completely unable to fly its very strongly implied that assuming that all the conditions were met any one of gods children could be zipping around up there right beside her which if you think about it opens the door to redefining what genre this show is technically still just as probable as warp one   that one little idea that a flying nun is just the result of solving an equation that one little idea turns what seems to be a religious sitcom into a sciencebased fantasy obeying its own strict internal rules in this universe with the right hat and the right wind you always fly if were being honest with ourselves thats practically arthur c clarke territory right there could the flying nun have been the most realistic scifi show that that late s had to offer oh before you start yelling star trek fans a quick question… have you guys finished making your transporters yet no well then youre still currently neck and neck with the theoretical physics shown by the flying nun try not to choke on your rage   hey you ever fly so fast that you turned into a lizard no   of course theres lots of other stuff ripe for overthinking from the very impressive lack of white authority figures after all why wouldnt puerto ricans be in charge of puerto rico to the ridiculous way sister bertrille always finds some excuse to fly oh carlos your girlfriend lost her favorite parrot why i should go look for it now but theres only so much room jasons willing to offer me to make a post about the flying nun so ill end by saying that i think the show ultimately turns out to be a little more daring now than it appeared to be back then and maybe after im done with all of spartacus blood  sand i might just go back and check out the flying nun
