his claim paying only a moderate return he did however invest his modest earnings in becoming a trader and drove mules between salt lake city and the boomtowns of montana supplying the residents with eggs and other basic needs tiring of that career clark became a banker in deer lodge montana and made a small fortune by repossessing mining properties when their owners defaulted on their loans he also invested in small smelting operations electric power companies newspapers railroads and many other montana businesses his investments were so profitable that he became known as one of the three �copper kings� of butte the others were marcus daly and f augustus heinze and between  and  he constructed a room tiffany decorated multimillion dollar mansion it is now the copper king bed and breakfast and museum entering into politics clark served as president of both of the montana state constitutional conventions held in  and  and became a hero in helena by campaigning for its selection as the state capital instead of anaconda clark used his newspaper the butte miner to further his political ambitions and was successfully elected to the united states senate in  it was discovered

to the university of california at los angeles the presently offered document is a very attractive stock certificate from the �moulton mining company� of �butte city montana� one of the many companies operated by clark printed in bold blue ink the central vignette features three individuals at work in a mine each one engaged in a different activity one uses a bar to pry at the rock another uses a drill while the third holds a light so the others can see a partly filled wheelbarrow can be seen between the two standing figures while the one operating the drill must avoid hitting a jack that apparently supports the ceiling the name of the company appears in an arc above this interesting scene along with the information that they were �incorporated under the laws of the territory of montana� though by the date of this certificate montana had achieved statehood immediately below the vignette is a lengthy financial obligation which states in part that �this certifies that john a wood is entitled to one hundred shares of the capital stock of the moulton mining company � with the value of each share being noted as  a second vignette divides the lower portion of the financial statement this one depicting a brawny miner standing before a mountainous landscape at the conclusion of the statement also separated by the vignette are the signatures of �john hanna� and �w a clark� who sign in their capacities of �asst secretary� and �president� respectively above clark�s signature is the date of issue �june th  while below the lower vignette is the imprint of the �american bank note company� the printers of this document a third signature this one punch cancelled appears vertically at left a decorative border frames the entire piece the verso is dominated by a lengthy transfer statement with the blank areas filled in with stamps and ink the shares were transferred only five months after they were purchased this interesting document is in extremely fine condition with sharp contrast the blue ink is especially bold against the white paper and wonderful eye appeal one very light vertical paper bend is present at the right affecting the area between the �w� and �a� in clark�s signature two small pinholes can be seen upon close examination one at the upper right and the other at the lower left these are neatly hidden in the decorative border and can only be seen when the piece is held to the light one small stain is present at the upper right and several areas of show through from the transfer on the verso are noted for accuracy as mentioned in the general description four cancellation holes are present at the left a very nice example of this attractive stock certificate boldly signed at the conclusion by one of america�s financial elite overall

king and queen county and were of english and possibly scots ancestry the clarks were common planters in virginia owners of modest estates and a few slaves and members of the anglican church clark did not have any formal education like many of his contemporaries he was tutored at home in later years he was selfconscious about his convoluted grammar and inconsistent spelling—he spelled sioux  different ways in his journals of the lewis and clark expedition—and sought to have his journals corrected before publication the spelling of american english was not standardized in clarks youth but his vocabulary suggests he was well read clarks five older brothers fought in virginia units during the american revolutionary war – but william was too young his oldest brother jonathan clark served as a colonel during the war rising to the rank of brigadier general in the virginia militia years afterward his secondoldest brother george rogers clark rose to the rank of general spending most of

they killed a total of eight men women and children in  clark was commissioned by general arthur st clair governor of the northwest territory as a captain in the clarksville indiana militia one older source says he was sent on a mission to the creek and cherokee whom the us hoped to keep out of the war in the southeast his responsibilities are unclear he may have visited new orleans at that time his travels prevented him from participating in general josiah harmars disastrous campaign into the northwest territory that year in  clark served as an ensign and acting lieutenant with expeditions under generals charles scott and james wilkinson he enlisted in the legion of the united states and was commissioned as a lieutenant on march   under anthony wayne on september   he was assigned to the th sublegion he was involved in several skirmishes with indians during the continuing northwest indian war at the battle of fallen timbers in  clark commanded a company of riflemen who drove back

william clark resigned his commission on july   and retired due to poor health although he was only  years old he returned to mulberry hill his familys plantation near louisville in  meriwether lewis

sovereignty of the us they were to find a waterway from the us to the pacific ocean and claim the oregon territory for the united states before european nations did clark spent three years on the expedition to the pacific coast a slave owner known to deal harshly with his slaves he brought york one of his slaves with him the indigenous nations treated york with respect and many of the native americans were interested in his appearance which played a key role in diplomatic relations although clark was refused a promotion to the rank of captain when jefferson asked the senate to appoint him at lewis insistence he exercised equal authority and continued the mission clark concentrated chiefly on the drawing of maps the management of the expeditions supplies and leading hunting expeditions for game indigenous nations and war in  president jefferson appointed clark as the brigadier general of the militia in the louisiana territory and the us agent for indian affairs at the time trade was a major goal and the us established the factory system the government and its appointees licensed traders to set up trading posts in native american territory native american relations were handled in what became the war department clark set up his headquarters in st louis missouri there he became a member of the freemasons a secret fraternal group the records of his initiation do not exist but on september   saint louis lodge no  issued a traveling certificate for clark as a reward for their contributions during their expedition to the pacific lewis and clark were given government positions jefferson appointed meriwether lewis territorial governor of upper louisiana commanderinchief of the militia and superintendent of indian affairs although he was in charge of indian affairs clark was under the supervision of the governor of the louisiana territory the governor had final say of all decisions made in the territory although clark had primary duties in dealing with the native americans the territorial governor held the title of ex officio superintendent of indian affairs clarks experiences during his crosscontinent expedition gave him the tools to be the ideal candidate for a diplomat to the native americans that was jeffersons motives behind giving clark these duties although it would not be until madisons presidency that clarks title became official president james madison appointed clark as missouri territorial governor and thus ex officio superintendent of indian affairs in that region during the summers of  and  in the earlier period clark performed the same duties that he would have if he held the title during the years while clark held position under governor lewis he was continuously involved in decisionmaking with him clark was consulted on affairs on a regular basis in louisiana and missouri clark served the united states government for the longest term in history as diplomat to the native american peoples indian diplomacy occupied much of clarks

time the dutiful soldier and bureaucrat never wavered in his commitment to an expansionist national agenda that expected indians to surrender their lands abandon their traditional ways and acquiesce to the dictates of the us government but he was aware of the consequences and he demonstrated genuine concern for the plight of destitute native people increasingly threatened with extinction clarks expeditions and frontier settlement gave him unique views and feelings toward native americans he felt as though he held a firm hand when he had to but at the same time he had passion towards them as

american people as well clark recognized indians nationalism their history language culture and territory and negotiated treaties between the various nations and his he tried to protect indians and

reasons by the time he was appointed governor clark appreciated his own capabilities and embraced them rather than turning them away when he took office america was involved in the war of  with the british clark feared the influence the british would have on the native americans british tactics would include the use of indians as allies in the fighting against the united states in return for british victory indians would either be able to continue to occupy their current land or receive lands back that were taken from them previously by the united states government clark held office for

americans the territorial governor held the title of ex officio superintendent of indian affairs clarks experiences during his crosscontinent expedition gave him the tools to be the ideal candidate for a diplomat to the native americans that was jeffersons motives behind giving clark these duties although it would not be until madisons presidency that clarks title became official president james madison appointed clark as missouri territorial governor and thus ex officio superintendent of indian affairs in that region during the summers of  and  in the earlier period clark performed the same duties that he would have if he held the title during the years while clark held position under governor lewis he was continuously involved in decisionmaking with him clark was consulted on affairs on a regular basis in louisiana and missouri clark served the united states government for the longest term in history as diplomat to the native american peoples indian diplomacy occupied much of clarks time the dutiful soldier and bureaucrat never wavered in his commitment to an expansionist national agenda that expected indians to surrender their lands abandon their traditional ways and acquiesce to the dictates of the us government but he was aware of the consequences and he demonstrated genuine concern for the plight of destitute native people increasingly threatened with extinction clarks expeditions and frontier settlement gave him unique views and feelings toward native americans he felt as though he held a firm hand when he had to but at the same time he had passion towards them as people still deserving of rights at times he was said to be too compassionate clark took his position as one of extreme importance to not only the government of the united states but to the native american people as well clark recognized indians nationalism their history language culture and territory and negotiated treaties between the various nations and his he tried to protect indians and preserve their culture by removing them from the evil influences of white society providing lifesaving inoculations having their portraits painted and assembling a museum of indian artifacts at the same time he removed indians from their ancestral lands encouraged federal civilization and education programs to change native lifestyles religious beliefs and cultural practices and usually promoted the interests of american citizens over indian needs and desires during the war of  clark led several campaigns among them in  one along the mississippi river up to the prairie du chienarea he established the shortlived fort shelby the first post in what is now wisconsin soon the post was captured by the british when the missouri territory was formed in  clark was appointed as the governor by president madison he was reappointed to the position by madison in  and in  by president monroe william clark appeared before supreme court judge john bc lucas in st louis on july   to take the oath of office as governor of the missouri territory clarks road to a gubernatorial appointment was long and complex upon lewis appointment by jefferson clark backed him and at times filled the role of governor without holding official position due to lewis complications in life whether it was debt loneliness or drinking upon the death of lewis in  clark declined to take office for varying reasons by the time he was appointed governor clark appreciated his own capabilities and embraced them rather than turning them away when he took office america was involved in the war of  with the british clark feared the influence the british would have on the native americans british tactics would include the use of indians as allies in the fighting against the united states in return for british victory indians would either be able to continue to occupy their current land or receive lands back that were taken from them previously by the united states government clark held office for the next seven years until he was voted out of office in  in the first election after missouri became a state he was defeated by alexander mcnair in  clark was appointed superintendent of indian affairs by president james monroe a new position created by congress after the factory system was abolished clark served in that position until his death his title changed with the creation of the office of indian affairs in  and finally the bureau of indian affairs in  both within the war department from  to  he was additionally appointed surveyor general of illinois missouri and the territory of arkansaw it was around this time that clark received as a gift from a potowatomi chief in missouri a rare smoking pipe or calumet that is now in the british museums collection as the superintendent of indian affairs clark was the most important man on native american matters west of the mississippi as superintendent at st louis clark took on some additional duties he issued licenses and granted passports to traders and travelers provided payments for injuries and injustices to both whites and indians invoked military force to arrest lawbreakers prevented or terminated hostilities between tribes removed unauthorized persons from indian country or confiscated their property established marked and surveyed boundaries distributed annuities and made sure that treaty provisions were delivered and conducted treaty councils of the four superintendents of indian affairs the others were the governors of michigan florida and arkansas territories clark had by far the largest superintendency though clark tried to maintain peaceful relations with indigenous nations and negotiated peace treaties he was involved in president andrew jacksons indian removal policy this included his duty to oversee removal he managed retaliation against black hawk and those allied with him in the black hawk war when hostilities arose between them and the americans clark issued an extermination order which he gave to lewis cass a man who played a central role in jacksons removal policy clark believed in the jeffersonian ideology in which assimilation would be the best course of action for native americans however in the end relocation of the indians from their native lands became the governments primary goal clarks government position on native american affairs kept him at the forefront of countless relocations he expressed sympathy for those uprooted tribes and promoted their interests as he understood them nevertheless he agreed with and implemented the policy of indian removal negotiating  or onetenth of all ratified treaties between american indians and the united states over the course of his career millions of acres passed from indian to us ownership
