strong start in the first quarter of  thanks to an improving economic outlook in february small business optimism as measured by the national federation of independent businesses was at its highest level in  years in addition the university of michigan’s march consumer confidence survey showed that consumers were more confident in the economy than they have been at any time since  against this backdrop growth stocks outperformed value stocks led by technology health care and consumer discretionary companies the recent strength in infrastructure companies banks and hightaxrate stocks stalled late in the quarter when following congress’s failure to agree on a health care reform bill investors began to question the trump administration’s ability to enact elements of its progrowth agenda within commodities the price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil fell  during the quarter in response to better than expected us oil inventories and production the russell  index advanced  in the first quarter and larger cap stocks outperformed smaller cap stocks the russell  index returned  followed by the russell mid cap index return of  and the russell  index result of  the russell micro cap index advanced just  in the quarter the russell  growth index outperformed the russell  value index by  technology was the best performing sector during the quarter while the energy sector was the worst performer driven by the decline in crude oil performance commentary the buffalo dividend focus fund posted a return of  for the quarter and outperformed the sp  index return of  for the quarter the fund’s relative outperformance was driven by the financials real estate and energy sectors while the top detracting sector was information technology the top contributors on an individual security standpoint were apple inc noble midstream partners and corecivic while hess corp exxonmobil corp and qualcomm inc were the top detractors within the financials sector the fund’s relative outperformance during the quarter was driven by stock selection as sp global inc gained  and visa inc rose  sp global’s performance was driven by strong fourth quarter earnings as each of its business segments ratings market intelligence and index reported better than expected revenue results while margins also improved relative to expectations visa’s performance also reflected strong fourth quarter earnings driven by the continued shift towards electronic payments as well as the consolidation of visa europe information technology was a drag on relative results during the period due to the sector allocation impact while the fund’s holdings performed slightly better than the index during the quarter the portfolio was underweight the second best performing benchmark sector which detracted from relative results taking a closer look at this area we note that most of the underperformance within the information technology sector was specific to the internet software  services subsector which does not consist of many dividend paying companies that meet our investment criteria outlook we expect the market to experience continued volatility in the coming quarters as the federal reserve continues to normalize interest rates along with a focus on the ability of the trump administration to enact infrastructure spending deregulation and corporate tax reform prospective tailwinds for the economy include further job growth wage increases lower tax rates and simply more optimism from both businesses and consumers all of which could lead to higher gross domestic product gdp growth on the other hand potential headwinds include potential strengthening of the us dollar further increases in interest rates and valuation metrics that are above historical market averages leading us to believe that the stock market may have a hard time achieving further multiple expansion despite the expectation of continued volatility we continue to focus on wide moat large capitalization companies that are trading at reasonable valuations in our view as always the fund will continue to focus on competitively advantaged companies that can be purchased at a fair price in our opinion as the stock market has continued to climb it is getting harder to find companies that fit our investment criteria but we continue follow our process of finding new investment ideas and to be ready when market declines provide better opportunities the opinions expressed are those of the portfolio managers and are subject to change are not guaranteed and should not be considered

commentary for q  capital market overview equity markets got off to a strong start in  thanks to an improving economic outlook around the globe the postelection reflation trade which caused massive sector rotation towards financials industrials and materials at the expense of growth sectors like technology and healthcare unwound toward the end of the first quarter of  as investors better understood the amount of political capital required to accomplish trump’s legislative agenda an uptick in inflation in china japan and europe continued to keep international market participants hopeful that some of the world’s major economies continued to improve within that backdrop international markets performed well with the russell global exus index advancing  versus the sp  index which increased  in the quarter performance commentary the buffalo international fund returned  for the quarter which outperformed the russell global exus return of  outperformance in the period was primarily driven by stock selection with a small benefit coming from our sector allocation impact the top contributors to the fund’s performance in the quarter were jenoptik ag and broadcom ltd jenoptik ag is an optoelectronics group that offers optical systems lasers and material processing the company benefited from increased purchases of defense systems as well as increasing penetration of optical solutions for metrology broadcom a stock we’ve owned almost since the fund’s inception is a semiconductor manufacturer continued to benefit as cellular handset and base station suppliers continued their rollout of g capabilities which requires greater use of semiconductor filters to handle the bandwidth and spectrum density top detractors during the period included the leisure equipment company amer sports oyj the specialty retailer yoox netaporter and healthcare holding teva pharmaceuticals amer sports oyj develops and manufactures sports and fitness equipment and clothing including the brands wilson precor and salomon the brands had a poor showing during the holiday season amid delays in new product launches yoox netaporter is a global online luxury retailer and although sales continued to grow strongly in the most recent quarter the company failed to bring as much of that revenue to the bottom line as expected as they continued to work on integrating disparate systems overall the healthcare market is facing a great deal of uncertainty due to efforts to repeal and replace the affordable care act as well as from intense scrutiny on pharmaceutical pricing practices teva has been a recipient of this scrutiny and the stock has suffered accordingly in addition teva’s acquisition of actavis hasn’t provided the anticipated synergies outlook having shrugged off hysteria caused by britain’s vote to exit the european union brexit in midyear  and gotten past a fed rate hike last december the outlook for global growth has turned positive with reflationary forces being felt in china europe and japan we are however concerned that some of the reflationary forces being propagated are due to another credit push from china which may not be sustainable in the medium turn in any event the markets are acting with relief that the worst has passed and perhaps central banks may be moving toward market price discovery among and between assets classes elections are front and center in the european union eu but for now polls seem to indicate that the status quo will continue we believe the political uncertainty in europe should ameliorate as we move to the second half of the year and attention again will focus on future central bank actions overall we continue to expect modestly improving economic growth around the globe our investment process is designed to favor a longterm secular growth perspective coupled within the context of our valuation and country specific macro analyses while our process remains unchanged we are taking incremental risks were it makes sense while continuing to keep an eye towards the pursuit of hedging capital from potential downside risks we continue to look for opportunities to buy or add to

improving economic outlook in february small business optimism as measured by the national federation of independent businesses was at its highest level in  years in addition the university of michigan’s march consumer confidence survey showed that consumers were more confident in the economy than they have been at any time since  against this backdrop growth stocks outperformed value stocks led by technology health care and consumer discretionary companies the recent strength in infrastructure companies banks and hightaxrate stocks stalled late in the quarter when following congress’s failure to agree on a health care reform bill investors began to question the trump administration’s ability to enact elements of its progrowth agenda within commodities the price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil fell  during the quarter in response to better than expected us oil inventories and production the russell  index advanced  in the first quarter and larger cap stocks outperformed smaller cap stocks the russell  index returned  followed by the russell mid cap index return of  and the russell  index result of  the russell micro cap index advanced just  in the quarter the russell  growth index outperformed the russell  value index by  technology was the best performing sector during the quarter while the energy sector was the worst performer driven by the decline in crude oil performance commentary the buffalo emerging opportunities fund posted a return of  in the quarter and outperformed the russell  growth index return of  the index returns this quarter were led by strong gains in the healthcare and information technology sectors of  and  respectively this was in stark contrast to the previous quarter after the presidential election where these two sectors were two of the worst performing sectors as investors favored financials and industrials given the expectations for progrowth policies and the anticipated impact on inflationinterest rates and infrastructure spending the fund’s outperformance during the period was led by the industrials sector where the fund’s holdings delivered an average of  return compared to the index return of  leading the way for the fund in industrials were kornit digital and installed building products kornit is the leading provider of digital direct to garment and rolltoroll printing allowing for high throughput of custom apparel and other use cases based on demand with kornit hardware and proprietary ink online apparel designers can produce short runs of custom pieces based solely on demand kornit has been a prime beneficiary in the shift in consumer’s increasing desire to purchase apparel online and a desire to have more unique pieces of clothing in january amazon selected kornit to deliver a large number of its avalanche  printers in support of amazon’s growing merch program in conjunction with this agreement kornit granted amazon warrants that do not vest until amazon purchases significant amounts of equipment and supplies from kornit installed building products ibp posted strong returns in the quarter as the housing market continues to perform well in an era of solid job market historically low interest rates and a demographic boost from millennials entering the housing market ibp is the second largest new residential insulation installer in the us with over  locations ibp has benefited from the scale of their operation which provides them purchasing power with vendors and labor capacity to meet demand we believe that demographics will continue to push new single family housing starts closer to historical levels as household formation trends could potentially benefit from millennials entering prime home buying ages the fund’s technology sector holdings also contributed to the outperformance in the quarter returning  on average compared to the index’s return of  for the sector instructure was one of many contributors to the outperformance in the sector the fund has owned instructure a provider of learning management systems for education institutions globally online lessons syllabi grades projects etc since its initial public offering ipo in november  the company has been a disruptor in the industry delivering a cloudbased solution with an enhanced user interface improved mobile usability and less downtime and upkeep for its schools and universities compared to legacy providers such as blackboard and moodle the fund looks for disruptors of industries that can execute on their strategy and instructure has fit the bill by continuing to take market share from the legacy providers putting up revenue growth above  and gross margins above  that point to the potential for an attractive bottom line margin profile as the company matures the healthcare sector represented a modest drag to benchmarkrelative performance results given our underweight in a quarter in which the sector was the strongest performer delivering a  return for the index regarding stock selection in the sector the fund’s return of  bested the index return and was led by omnicell omnicell is a leading provider of medication dispensing cabinets and management systems for acute care hospitals and has been a multiyear holding in the fund their solutions provide hospitals with more effective control of medications from the time they hit the loading dock until they are given at the patient’s bedside much like instructure in the previous paragraph omnicell has been a disruptor taking share in a ratio of  in terms of winloss ratio versus the legacy player and market leader that is now a subsidiary of becton dickinson omnicell is in the middle of a new medical cabinet hardware release in which the upgrade cycle should last five to seven years and could provide them with a revenue opportunity of  billion while hospital spending could be a concern given the changing healthcare reimbursement landscape we believe omnicell’s multiyear technology lead over their peer and the upgrade cycle has the fund positioned in the best disruptor in the industry we remain focused on valuations and fundamentals and continue to monitor the riskreward profile of our holdings we will make changes based on market moves intra quarter that could provide either an opportunity to trim or add to a position based on potential inefficiencies in the smaller end of the market cap spectrum we ended the quarter with  holdings and continue to look for prudent ways to deploy cash as we remain longterm focused aiming to be shrewd when the market environment presents opportunity outlook as the daily political headlines pass geopolitical tensions heat up and the realization that getting legislation passed in washington is never easy we aim to stay consistent to our strategy of building a portfolio of securities that should benefit from underlying secular growth trends that could have thriving business models over the long term regardless of the political climate the buffalo emerging opportunities fund is focused primarily on identifying innovation within us companies with north american revenue bases therefore the universe of companies we review for inclusion in the fund is typically much more uscentric than most mid and large cap companies we like this positioning given the dollar appreciation and foreign policy uncertainty in addition us consumer and small business confidence are near or at alltime highs which should also bode well for our smaller uscentric companies additionally we continue to believe the landscape for potential acquisitions could benefit the fund as larger companies continue to search out areas for growth as we enter year nine of the current bull market the opinions expressed are those of the portfolio managers and are
