vc technology startups and what ive learned skip to content homeabout ← business lessons learned from harry potter a guest blog by lauren roth for many startups summiting the mountain is only half the job → sales vs marketing at saas companies posted on july   by douglas j roth it is amazing to me how many earlystage companies don’t really know the difference between sales and marketing and therefore aren’t able to drive or manage either exceptionally well my first job was as a sales rep responsible for selling telecommunications transmission infrastructure equipment  the difference between sales and marketing responsibilities was described to me in this way “sales is getting rid of what we have marketing is making sure we have what we can get rid of” tomasz tunguz of redpoint ventures had a great blog recently  the marketing math behind scaling a saas salesforce  the focus is on the marketing side of the equation and the gist is that as a saas company scales the company must begin to mechanize the sales process  mechanization is about making sure that not only has sales figured how to sell in an efficient repeatable manner but sales also has a pretty good idea of when more resources are needed and the level of production that can be expected by the addition of new sales reps  successful marketing is a prerequisite to this mechanization process  tomasz’s states “in saas companies one of the marketing department’s primary responsibilities is generating sufficient customer interest to enable the company to achieve their revenue targets”  said another way marketing’s job is to get the snowball rolling down the hill such that it collects more snow grows in size rolls faster and gains momentum my dad’s retirement gift to himself was a john deere tractor  one of the attachments we use is a wood chipper  the wood chipper runs off the drivetrain of the tractor  once you engage the wood chipper the tractor engine starts spinning the wood chipper’s heavy flywheel with its teeth or blades  it is the momentum of this spinning flywheel that enables you to chewup and spitout branches four inches in diameter or greater  however it takes some time for the flywheel to get up to cutting speed before the power of the system becomes truly impressive and productive saas businesses are a lot like a wood chipper  it takes a lot of customers to generate the kind of momentum that generates truly impressive revenue generation  the wood chipper will actually keep cutting for a time even after the tractor is turned off  similarly a saas business will continue to generate revenue even if no new customers are added – although churn will slowly cause that revenue to diminish over time similar to the flywheel slowing down and diminishing its cutting ability the mechanization of sales is no different than getting the flywheel of a chipper spinning at a fastenough speed that it becomes an efficient cutting machine  marketing is the tractor drivetrain providing the power to the sales team  there are a number of ways – or levers – marketing can help sales and therefore the company improve the rate of sales growth and ensure its sustainability  tomasz lays out some simple saas sales math that suggests some of these levers in a basic finance class at business school we learned about one way to measure the success of a company and compare it to others operating in the same or other industries  return on equity roe is a measure of the productivity or efficiency with which shareholders’ equity is employed and is defined as the company’s net income divided by its shareholder equity  this simple equation can be expanded into three financial ratios   net incomesales  salesassets and  assetsshareholders’ equity  these ratios are commonly referred to as  profit margin  asset turnover and  financial leverage  this says that management has three levers for controlling roe  the earnings squeezed out of each dollar of sales  the sales generated from each dollar of assets employed and  the amount of equity used to finance those assets see analysis for financial management by robert c higgins just as there are various levers that can be adjusted to improve roe there are levers available to marketing to improve the saas math  one lever tomasz suggests “before investing heavily in growing a sales team saas companies should understand if the marketing team can generate sufficient leads to feed the sales team’s pipeline”  marketing can take actions that increase the total number of leads in the pipeline  but not all leads however are the same – quality versus quantity  by improving the quality of the leads before they eventually become sales’ responsibility marketing is adjusting another lever at its disposal one focused on improving the leadtoclose success rate  another lever average selling price can also be manipulated to some degree by marketing  getting back to my early definition of marketing – making sure you have what you can get rid of – marketing must have a solid understanding of the needs of the market and develop a product roadmap that delivers a compelling solution to customers’ problems  you can charge more if you can solve more of a customer’s problems i’ve seen far too many companies staff up well in advance of expected demand only to find demand never materialize or develop at a much slower pace  the results are an increase in burn with no corresponding increase in revenue or customer adoption  this generally doesn’t end well  for saas companies in particular we know ahead of time that it will take a while for sales momentum to grow  but with a solid understanding of the distinct roles both sales and marketing can play in the organization entrepreneurs can leverage their marketing team to create sales momentum  then you can feed your competition into the wood chipper… advertisements share thistwitterfacebookgoogleemaillinkedinlike

potter a guest blog by lauren roth for many startups summiting the mountain is only half the job →  responses to sales vs marketing at saas companies jlc says july   at  pm so true – i can’t tell you how many softwaresaas developers i’ve talked to that don’t know the difference between sales and marketing the simple way i think about it is that generally sales is driving shortterm revenue and marketing is teeing up what’s needed for longterm revenue reply douglas j roth says july   at  pm thanks for your comment i totally agree with your description of marketing’s role there is an even larger continuum that i think about described in generalities of course a company’s labs are focused on scientific and technology research that will generate revenue  years out product development teams are developing product concepts and platforms that will generate revenue in  years the corporate venture arm is seeking revenues in  –  years business development is developing partnerships channels and strategic relationships to resulting in revenue  –  years out marketing is teeing up revenue  –  years out sales is generating now – monthly quarterly and annually and corporate development is able to purchase revenue streams across all these time periods in addition to “teeing up” revenue marketing should also be making the sales job easier – higher qualified leads leads primed to purchase leads preferring your brand to others etc reply leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here fill in your details below or click an icon to log in email required address never
