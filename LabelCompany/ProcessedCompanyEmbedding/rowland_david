stacking chair with a wire frame and sculpted seat and back forty of them could be stacked just  feet high on a specially designed dolly it not only stacked with ease but could be ganged together to form rows in a matter of seconds the slim slender profile of the design completely belies the comfort it offers an attribute achieved only after long testing to find the contour that would best fit the greatest number of human shapes for a long time however rowland had difficulty finding a manufacturer willing to take a license to make his versatile chair they would always turn it down because they couldn’t imagine the chair would be strong enough when it looked so light the tide turned when the architectural firm of skidmore owings and merrill ordered  of the chairs on behalf of the university of illinois at chicago circle now the university of illinois at chicago then the general fireproofing co gf willingly took a license from rowland to make the chairs david rowlands  stacking

rowland’s work is that of innovator problem solver futurist minimalist and artist it is intelligent purposeful refined and enduring  automobiles rowland’s automobile designs and renderings from his time at the university of southern california foreshadow his propensity for sleek uncluttered form exquisite attention to detail and of course his skill as an artist  molded veneer chairs rowland’s first chair the ribbon chair is an experimental design constructed of molded veneer the second chair also of molded veneer has a tubular steel cantilever frame which adds flexibility to the design both designs are exceptionally elegant  magic carpet chair designed and created by rowland during his time at cranbrook the magic carpet chair is “the padded spring chair that isn’t” it has the comfort of an upholstered chair without all the padding the seat and back are constructed of flexible steel wires woven with wool yarn by his classmate textile designer jack lenor larsen and the design can be easily adapted to seating in cars buses airplanes and even tanks the seats and backs are also bulletproof a response to rowland’s fear as a wwii bomber pilot of being hit by bullets from beneath his seat one of rowland’s cranbrook professors says that this chair is “better than eames”—the highest praise for the young industrial designer  spider chair an experimental chair of woven steel wire and yarn the spider chair is developed and created by rowland in california and at cranbrook where jack lenor larsen wove the seat in a manner similar to the magic carpet chair it also has a unique torsion bar suspension  license plate gas cap cover rowland had a summer job pumping gas and he never knew which side of the car the gas cap would be on this gave him the idea of moving the gas cap to under the rear license plate of the car where it would be centrally located and neatly hidden while at cranbrook he takes his design to the chief stylist of a major automobile company in the detroit area in the hopes of securing a summer job they tell him they aren’t interested in his feature or in hiring him six months later his license plate gas cap cover appears on their cars over the years the feature is incorporated on over  million cars this is a pivotal moment in rowland’s career as he learns early about the importance of patenting and protecting his ideas  transparent chair the nosag spring company of detroit gives rowland his first commission an experimental chair that would showcase their springs the transparent chair is a thin resilient chair at just ¼inch thick and is soft without being bulky rowland wanted the design to be as pure as possible while highlighting the company’s sinuous springs the chair is shown to wide acclaim at the national home furnishing show in new york’s grand central palace and is called “a chair ahead of its time”  lamps rowland designs a number of chandeliers and lamps featuring diffused light he wins first prize for one of them in a contest sponsored by the new york residential lighting forum and the illuminating  engineers society the second photo shown here includes a glass  top desk and office of rowland’s design  outdoor furniture suite for maria bergson rowland’s first job in new york is designing and fabricating an  outdoor furniture suite for maria bergson bergson best known  for revolutionizing and modernizing commercial office design  commissions rowland to design and build a complete set of terrace  furniture for the executive offices of the pacific coast borax  company in beverly hills ca  lounge set in the early s during the work on the bergson project  rowland continued to experiment with his key elements of seating—thin cushions minimal and efficient base structure and simple lines that respond to the inclined and draped human form  norman bel geddes renderings norman bel geddes futurist and “father of industrial design” a title shared with raymond loewy seeks out rowland an excellent draftsman to work freelance on architectural renderings for him the three drawings shown here are examples of rowland’s work for bel geddes two of the renderings are of the walless house designed with walls that could be opened or closed depending on the weather in  bel geddes takes his staff with rowland as head draftsman to jamaica for the summer there rowland makes hundreds of renderings including many for the interiors of seagram’s liquor stores  drain dry cushion at an outdoor furniture showroom in new york rowland introduces himself to a furniture company president who asks him to create a special product—a seating cushion that water would easily pass through for the next two years rowland studies different materials and waterproofing processes until he devises a successful design the drain dry cushion  he patents the product and licenses it to lee woodward  sons the royalty income pays rowland’s rent for the next  years and allows him to open his own studio  cohen house rowland’s design for an architectural renovation of a residence  in riverdale ny recalls the work of frank lloyd wright an early  childhood influence  residential and commercial interiors rowland’s interior designs include an apartment on sutton place and an office at  th avenue in new york in keeping with his commitment to making the greatest impact with the least amount of material he sometimes used diaphanous screens or beaded dividers to separate space as in these examples as well as the simplest contemporary furniture  mod maximum order  dimensioning system after extensive research on the measurements of human anatomy rowland invents his maximum order dimensioning system or the mod when one mod which is  ” long is multiplied by small whole numbers the result is a series of optimal product dimensions for people—such as the ideal height for seats desks doors beds etc rowland’s dimensioning system is intended to help create furniture that is the most comfortable for the greatest number of people his  chair is based on the mod  museum wall system rowland creates this singular wall system for hanging works of art in museums and galleries the ingenious design consists of a metal mesh underside covered with panels of yarn which eliminates the need for the museum or gallery walls to be repainted when an  exhibition changes it is an example of rowland’s forwardthinking approach in which he designs a simple straightforward product to replace the conventional—burdensome and inefficient—way things had been done  mesh chair this experimental chair is another example of rowland’s exploration  of minimalist design the seat and back are made of either knitted steel or plastic mesh stretched across a tubular steel frame  zig zag cantilever chair the zig zag cantilever chair further develops the principles rowland worked out in his earlier transparent chair its unique patented  mechanical and design features include a weatherproof and squeakproof method of attaching springs to frame where the springs are simply snapped over the tubular frame and the assembly dipcoated in vinyl plastic the chair is included in the prestigious th triennale exhibition in milan italy

snug stretch slipcover that could be purchased in different colors—no upholstery needed it is another example of rowland’s desire for compactness simplicity practicality and efficiency in his design work the take home sofa is the forerunner of his modulus seating system  introduced twenty years later  disposable safety ashtray rowland did not smoke himself but observed the need for a safer ashtray in order to prevent cigarettes from causing burns and fires he invents an ashtray where cigarettes would always fall into the tray this patented design is composed of two concentric and stackable cupshaped receptacles configured in such a way to prevent  cigarettes from falling out and is made of a disposable fireproof  material the topmost ashtray could be easily lifted off leaving a clean one underneath  the earl rowland foundation david rowland establishes this nonprofit foundation in honor of his father earl rowland who had been a california plein aire artist and the director of the pioneer galleries and haggin museum in stockton ca from  to  the principle purpose of the foundation was to develop a library of narrated filmstrip documentaries recording significant museum exhibitions which were then circulated to smaller museums and educational institutions across the country and abroad  soflex soflex is a material invented by rowland in which sinuous metal springs are dipped in vinyl plastisol when cured the plastisol hardens and holds the springs together forming a thin openmesh resilient seating material previously if designers wanted a thin seating material they had to rely on something hard like plastic or molded plywood conversely if they wanted something soft it had to be thick and unwieldy such as foam cushioning soflex solved this predicament by yielding an extremely thin material that was also soft and flexible affording a comfortable seat it is made in individual units to be applied to unique seat frames  softec chair the softec chair incorporates soflex rowland’s resilient seating material described above the chair stacks compactly and is produced in numerous variations in addition to the side chair there are arm chairs bar chairs outdoor

nearly a century organized medicine tried to discredit and destroy chiropractic  on  august  a us court ruled that the american medical association and its officials were guilty of participating in an illegal conspiracy to destroy the chiropractic profession today this suppression is being carried on by quackwatch wwwquackwatchorg – not only against chiropractic but also every established profession that competes with orthodox medicine – including acupuncture homeopathy naturopathy herbal medicine orthomolecular medicine and nutrition  quackwatch has gone so far as to discredit the nobel prize winning scientists dr linus pauling and dr otto warburg quackwatch is headed by stephen barrett a delicensed medical doctor who proudly admits his intention is to damage practitioners and businesses that dare to make alternative therapies and products available  barrett often resorts to libel and character assassination in his false propaganda campaigns to be targeted by quackwatch is

dhms city tv health expert medical advisor to dr oz show vitamost® over  years featured posted on july   by drowland for  years david rowland’s formulas have been sold by wordofmouth without advertising of any kind  people simply telling others about the results they have achieved have enabled many thousands of people in  countries to overcome significant health challenges we wish as many people as possible to be able to access these unique formulas that excel at correcting the causes of degenerative health conditions to view or buy rowland formulas™ products  wwwvitamostcom   effective formulas posted on july   by drowland vitamost® foodbased medicines are so effective primarily because they are formulated for totality by prof david w rowland  each formula is like a symphony orchestra with certain instruments playing lead parts and others supporting roles  and every instrument influences the result nutrients work interactively with each other  every factor needed by the body for a particular purpose has to be present in optimal amounts and must also have its supporting copartners present in optimal amounts  if even one nutrient is lacking the formula becomes like the proverbial chain that is only as strong as its weakest link the body has its own wisdom  it heals itself if given the raw materials it needs  each   formulas provides a buffet of all of the factors the body needs to do a particular job  and if everything it could possibly use is provided the body selectively chooses what it needs and in proportion to its need  just as you eat more when you’re hungry and less when you’re not the body consumes large portions of what it lacks and little or none of what it doesn’t need each of is unique biochemically  we are as different on the inside as we are on the outside  our bodies require the same nutrients but in different proportions  every vitamost®  formula is so complete for its purpose that people with widely differing needs benefit from it  someone may have deficiencies in say four nutrients and also require another seven to assist in utilizing those four  others will need a quite different combination of nutrients and copartners  if all are present in optimal amounts each person will get what their unique body requires david’s formulas also emphasize essential or primary nutrients – the ones that we have to get from our food supply because the body cannot produce them internally  if the body gets enough of these basics then it can produce all of the secondary or intermediate factors it needs – according to its own wisdom and priorities  for example if the body gets enough vitamin c it can make all of the coenzyme q it needs  or if the body gets enough linoleic acid eg from flaxseed oil and enough vitamins and minerals it can make all the gammalinolenic acid it needs without having to take supplements of evening primrose oil form of delivery also makes a difference to effectiveness  tablets are used for complex formulations in order to prevent interaction of ingredients eg choline reacting with vitamin c to produce choline ascorbate  capsules are used for ingredients that don’t interact  liquids are used for sublingual absorption of homeopathics  timedrelease forms are never used because of their inefficiency many people’s digestion isn’t strong enough to break down the multiple layers of wax on the ingredients and many timedrelease products end up in the toilet to view or buy vitamost® supplements  wwwvitamostcom     vitamost®  results posted on july   by drowland unique purpose  each vitamost® formula is a foodbased medicine that provides specific support for a particular bodily system of health challenge broad spectrum  each tablet provides a unique blend of up to  nutrients working together interactively and synergistically high potency  each active ingredient is present in quantities high enough to deliver optimal results balanced ratios  all nutrients are in complementary balance in ratios that are well utilized by the body  no gaps  no excesses natural ingredients  every molecule of each ingredient in vitamost® formulas is bioidentical to the same molecule found in nature hypoallergenic  vitamost® tabelts are hypoallergenic in that they do not contain sugar starch colourings flavourings preservatives milk wheat soy corn or yeast rapid release  tablets disintegrate rapidly in gastric fluid to ensure optimal absorption quality assured  vitamost® products are manufactured to dr rowland’s exacting specifications in a licensed fda compliant

vitalized® difference posted on july   by drowland                 the vitalized® patents prof david rowland discovered a way to manufacture vitaminmineral tablets that enhances their bioenergetic qualities  for this innovation he was awarded us patent no  and canadian patent no  documented tests and kirlian photographs show that tablets made by the unique vitalized® method have a significantly higher vibratory rate “vital force“ than the identical formulas made by conventional methods  this higher energetic frequency stimulates cells to make more efficient use of nutrients the above photos of tablets were taken with a highly sensitive kirlian camera  this is an instrument that captures the electromagnetic field of energy that surrounds living beings and physical objects  the camera’s lighting aperture timing and frequency settings were kept constant for the pair of photos the photo on the left is of a vitaminmineral tablet that was manufactured in the conventional way  the photo on the right is of the identical vitaminmineral formula but manufactured by the vitalized® method  notice the brighter more intensely radiant beams of energy emanating from the vitalized®

expert david is a featured author at amazoncom    httpwwwamazoncomauthordavidwrowland   mineral absorption posted on july   by drowland myth  chelated minerals citrates and picolinates are more efficiently absorbed than most other mineral compounds truth  not necessarily  if mineral supplements are taken with meals there is usually no significant difference in absorption if mineral supplements are taken with meals there is no difference in their rate of absorption regardless of the form that those minerals happen to be in  always take mineral supplements with meals in order to enable the body to do its own chelating  the minerals need to be present with food for this to happen in the stomach  if digestion is weak then overcome this weakness by taking supplementary digestive enzymes that will improve the body’s ability to utilize both food and supplements  this approach is far more effective for overall health than taking prechelated minerals which bypass digestive weakness  chelated minerals may be better absorbed on an empty stomach but offer no particular advantage compared to minerals taken with food  in one study fasting subjects were given  mg of calcium from each of five calcium compounds and milk  no significant differences in absorption were found among the various sources of calcium  the mean net calcium absorption in each case was  from calcium carbonate  from calcium acetate  from calcium lactate  from milk  from calcium citrate and  from calcium gluconate  calcium from calcium carbonate is well absorbed if taken with a meal– even if stomach acid is otherwise too low  calcium carbonate provides the highest amount of calcium  of all supplementary sources eg calcium citrate provides  and calcium gluconate   similarly magnesium oxide provides the highest amount of magnesium  and potassium chloride has the highest amount of potassium  to view or buy vitamost® supplements  wwwvitamostcom buy book recent posts nutritional solutions
