amateur sports administration market in which there are many competitors some competitors focus on the top of the pyramid for example sports federations leagues and clubs providing data storage and manipulation for the league and club management other competitors focus on providing more specific services at the lower end of the pyramid to amateur sports teams these services typically include player sign up scheduling and communications data collection storage and data manipulation the services are typically provided using downloadable native applications there are some companies that address both markets the leagues and providing federations leagues and clubs and teams the most significant competitors are teamsnap and sportsngn they are both well funded organization competing in the same marketplace their products are well designed and popular in the market place however from a user’s prospective their services are not as easy to identify we intend to compete by making our products easy to use and understand our prices and services are clearly listed on the website they do not have to search and go through a series of hoops to find out the actual cost of our services our main competitors have large marketing budgets and will be difficult to compete with competitors to a lesser extent are eteamz and sportslogic their product is equally concentrated on larger sports organizations leagues and clubs versus teams these companies also provide a mix of applications that are similar to ours they are also well capitalized with large marketing budgets and will be difficult to compete with other competitors there is a myriad of small companies that provide some or all or more of the services we provide overall there is a barrier to entry to this market due to
