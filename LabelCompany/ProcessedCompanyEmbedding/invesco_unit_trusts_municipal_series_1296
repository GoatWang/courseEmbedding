the bonds by appraisal or  by any combination of the above security cost  the original cost to the trust investment grade municipal trust intermediate series  was based on the determination by the evaluator of the offering prices of the bonds on the date of deposit march   since the valuation is based upon the bid prices the trust investment grade municipal trust intermediate series  recognized a downward adjustment of  on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices this downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized

an issue of bonds pr indicates a bond has been prerefunded redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par to the extent that the bonds were deposited in the trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units conversely to the extent that the bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed bonds and there will be distributed to unitholders the principal amount in excess of  per unit semiannually for trusts with a date of deposit prior to april   or in excess of  per unit monthly for trusts with a date of deposit on or after april   and any premium received on such redemption however should the amount available for distribution in the

interest exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption that would have been payable if redemption had not been made determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate which varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on municipal obligations with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate from the dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made over ii the aggregate principal amount of the bonds being redeemed insurance  insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on certain of the bonds in the trust may have been obtained by the trust or by one of the preinsured bond insurers as indicated in the bond name however certain other bonds may not be insured such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units for bonds covered under the trusts insurance policy the insurance is effective only while bonds thus insured are held in the trust and the insurance premium which is a trust obligation is paid on a monthly basis the premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the bond involved is payable by the issuer asc states that for financial reporting purposes insurance coverage of the type acquired by the trust does not have any measurable fair value in the absence of default of the underlying bonds or of indications of the probability of such default fair value measurements  as described in note  the trust utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of its investments asc establishes both a framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes

desiring to dispose of his units may be able to do so only by tendering such units to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price  note   other continued cost to investors  the cost to original investors was based on the evaluator s determination of the aggregate offering price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investor s purchase plus a sales charge of  of the public offering price

will remain outstanding until redeemed by unitholders or until the termination of the trust agreement objectives and bond selection the trusts seek to preserve capital and to provide federal taxexempt income and in the case of most state trusts federal and state taxexempt income the trusts invest in portfolios of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united states

trusts state and if applicable local personal income tax purposes under existing law an imit laddered series has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of interestbearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately  to  years in which roughly  of the bonds mature every five years beginning in approximately the tenth year of the trust a state intermediate laddered maturity trust has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of intermediateterm interestbearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately  to  years in which roughly  of the bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the trust there is of course no guarantee that the trusts will achieve their objectives a trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxexempt fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually diversification of a trust s assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in each insured trust has been obtained from municipal bond insurance companies see insurance on the bonds in addition these bonds are often not available in small amounts in selecting bonds for the trusts the sponsor considered the following factors among others the ratings criteria applicable to your trust as listed under principal investment strategy b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsor s determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration  in particular the ratings of the bonds in any investment grade municipal trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa  during the trust s life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors the bonds your trust invests in municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds we seek to diversify your portfolio by type of bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds a percentages they represent in your portfolio as listed under summary of essential financial information these bonds are described in greater detail in the information supplement see additional information general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuer s general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds  health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer

other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on

issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic

and government regulation and rate approvals more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond s par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond s par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond s par value municipal bond risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poor s rating services downgraded the longterm sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trust s holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bond s issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant credit risk is the risk that a bond s issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bond s call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond s par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is listed in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and  view more similar documents invesco unit
