posted on june     views as a rule i dont buy penny stocks and ive definitely never written an article about one  some companies trading as penny stocks may have good intentions from management and actually be on the upandup but they still lack the industry contacts products revenue growth and earnings potential to interest me ive made an exception in the case of sigma labs inc sglb and that exception is made based on research that i will share in this article   business overview sigma labs inc is a development stage corporation that was founded in  by highlevel scientists from the worldrenowned los alamos national lab  the company consists of two operating subsidiaries sumner associates inc which is a consulting firm for government agencies and the public sector and b sigma inc which specializes in the development  commercialization of innovative manufacturing and materials technologies in the additive manufacturing d printing industry sigma labs is a true microcap with a current trading valuation of just m and a handful of employees   revenue generation projected to ramp up to date the company has not generated a profit and  of the modest revenue in  just under m came from their consulting subsidiary and not their additive manufacturingd printing subsidiary however revenue from the companys additive manufacturing solutions and the potential for positive earnings should increase dramatically in  and into next year due to the commercialization of their patentpending printrited™ technology  in their q filed in may probably unseen by many investors management made some remarkably bullish statements which they have not discussed as yet in a press release these statements include “we believe that continued development of our manufacturing quality control technologies will enable us to reach commercialization of this technology during the remainder of  ” “based on the funds we have as of may   and the revenues we expect to receive under our consulting agreements we believe that we will have sufficient funds to pay our administrative and other operating expenses for the balance of ” “management anticipates that additional contracts and their recent business acquisitions will allow the company to achieve profitable operations ” there are no guarantees that sigma labs will be profitable soon but based on their low cash burn rate and total expenses last quarter of just   the potential for a turn to profitable operations with their printrited ™ products on deck for commercialization in the second half of this year is very real   new product offerings to drive growth the ability of any company to generate meaningful organic revenue growth and positive earnings is largely dependent on new product offerings that effectively address a need or limitation experienced by their customers sigma labs has patented products in advanced munitions and advanced reactive materials and structures which are currently in commercialization  however management predicts that the major revenue and income driver will be from sales and licensing of their printrite ™ technology   there are three current problems with d printing of metal parts that sigma labs is addressing getting the right quality  for the most critical applications in d printing like defense and aerospace there is still a lot of variation part to part run to run and machine to machine this requires extensive postprocess inspection time and financial resources getting the right shape because melting of metal powder is a very high temperature process layers of parts built up can distort or change shape during buildup this must be either measured or compensated for to ensure that the right part geometry gets built every time once again postprinting process inspections require additional time and money for customers targeted by sigma labs current printing speed too slow on any one region of the part the buildup speed is  cubic inch per hour although several parts can be built in a single build run this rate is too slow to allow d printing of metal parts to go beyond aerospace defense and biomedical to automotive and general industrial applications printrited™ inspect from sigma labs sigma labs addresses these issues with the printrited inspect module which verifies part quality onmachine in realtime and their printrited deform module which verifies part geometry beta testing of these sigma labs technologies is being carried out in a partnership with ge aviation  a worldleading provider of commercial and military jet engines and components this ge aviation press release announcing a cooperative development agreement with sigma labs last month validates printrite d ™ technology from sigma labs as a cutting edge product that addresses a real need in the d printing industry “today postbuild inspection procedures account for as much as  percent of the time required to produce an additively manufactured engine component said greg morris ge aviations business development leader for additive manufacturing by conducting those inspection procedures while the component is being built ge aviation and sigma labs will expedite production rates for ges additive manufactured engine components like the leap fuel nozzle the leap engine with multiple d printed parts represents a huge market opportunity for ge less than two weeks ago it was announced that they have received over b in orders for the engine the accelerated production of the leap engines d printed components has also been noted in engineering and d printing news sources as being due in large part to sigma labs “ge aviation said it will speed up the process of d printing jet engine parts by  percent to support an ambitious production schedule with the help of inprocess inspection technologies as part of a new agreement with sigma labs inc” spar point group “ge aviation looking to speed up d print times” “each engine will contain  dprinted fuel nozzles each of which will be  percent lighter and  times more efficient than conventionally manufactured nozzles” and “ the sigma labs and ge aviation partnership marks another step forward in the development of d printing as viable end product production technique” engineeringcom “sigmas printrited is designed to give engineers micro structural control during additive manufacturing offering unique quality control capabilities” d printer world ge aviation expects to chop off about  percent of the total d printing time of metallic production components for its leap leading edge aviation propulsion turbofan engine thats pretty amazing considering how slow the build times usually are for additive manufacturing am techniques the secret lies in some inprocess inspection technologies ge aviation will jointly develop with sigma labs design news   from beta testing to sales now that their products have been shown to successfully address several obstacles in metal d printing the next step for sigma labs is to commercialize the printrite d ™ system management was clear in their q filing on may  th that this is exactly what they intend to do stating “we believe that our continued development in fiscal  of our manufacturing quality control technologies will enable us to reach commercialization of this technology during the remainder of   we will continue to refine ipqa ®  printrite ™ technology  for the emerging additive manufacturing market” sigma labs ceo mark cola also stated during an investor presentation held this month “we have definite revenue projections in  and  that we are aggressively pursuing and will be reporting on quarterly we anticipate that our internal business plans and models will lead us to profitability and we will be reporting on our progress quarterly through our qk filings”   sigma labs balance sheet not the typical mess you find in a penny stock sigma labs has a current ratio of  which is better by far than organovo holdings onvo and comparable to d systems ddd at  for newer investors the current ratio is used to give an idea of the companys ability to pay back its shortterm liabilities debt and payables with its shortterm assets cash inventory receivables the higher the current ratio the more capable the company is of paying its obligations a ratio under  suggests that the company would be unable to pay off its obligations if they came due at that point investopedia sigma labs based on their current ratio isnt likely to go under even though their current share price seems to suggest they will their balance sheet really is quite unusual for a penny stock management has definitely been controlling costs while still developing and preparing to roll out what i believe will be a gamechanging product for them moreover the company managed to turn slightly cash flow positive in q due in part to a decrease in accounts receivable operating activities       net income loss       adjustments to reconcile net income loss  to net cash provided used by operations noncash expenses              amortization            depreciation            stock compensation     change in assets and liabilities              decrease in accounts receivable            decrease in prepaid assets            decrease in accounts payable             decrease in accrued expenses      net cash provided used by operating activities    its not all good one  million negative there is one rather significant problem with sigma labs from my standpoint and that is the large number of shares outstanding m while founders insiders and major stakeholders control about  of the shares the float is still huge and that might present difficulty for sustained price movement trading in the stock is volatile and  daily price swings are not unusual one thing management might consider is a massive reverse split to get the price closer to share and eventually meet reporting requirements to get uplisted to a major exchange this would allow more significant institutional participation also however my guess is that for the moment management is fully engaged in the process of commercialization of the printrite ™ products one bright spot in the share structure is sigma labs has not diluted shares over the last  months to any meaningful extent shares increased by less than m between march  and march    conclusion sigma labs is not your typical penny stock despite the negative share structure noted above the company has a healthy balance sheet and even managed to generate a very small amount of positive cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter from my experience its unusual to find this in a  stock whats far more unusual is for that same tiny company to have a cutting edge product that by all reports addresses several problems in the d printing industry the fact that the beta testing has been run with ge aviation who confirm they are realizing time money and materials savings with sigma labs and the printrite d™ system tells me sigma labs is the real deal with a real product on the verge of commercialization in the d printing industry i believe that the stock is very likely going to appreciate a great deal from the current price as signed sales contracts and managements predictions of profitability take place perhaps as soon as this year gary anderson please enable javascript to
