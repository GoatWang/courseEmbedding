their investment mix the securities held in a uit generally remain fixed how are uit securities chosensome uit securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index other uits are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics according to specific objectives once securities are selected the uit portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust can a security held in a uit be removed at any timewhile it is rare
