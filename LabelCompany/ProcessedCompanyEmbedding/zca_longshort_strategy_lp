long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline a longshort equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions although this may not always be the case the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions or the other way around the longshort equity strategy is popular with hedge funds many of which employ a marketneutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal breaking down longshort equity while many hedge funds also employ a longshort equity strategy with a long bias such as  where long exposure is  and short exposure is  comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their longshort strategy longshort equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography advanced economies emerging markets europe etc sector energy technology etc investment philosophy value or growth and so on an example of a longshort equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund a popular variation of the longshort model is that of the “pair trade which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector for example an investor in the technology space may take a long position in microsoft and offset that with a short position in intel if the investor buys  shares of microsoft at  each and intel is trading at  the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing  intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal the ideal situation for this longshort strategy would be for microsoft to appreciate and for intel to decline if microsoft rises to  and intel falls to  the overall profit on this strategy would be  even if intel advances to  – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at  although much less so to get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison longshort strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs for example if interest rates are rising a hedge fund may short interestsensitive sectors such as utilities and go long on defensive sectors such as health care trading center longshort
