natural gas hess owns  percent of a refinery it operates in the us virgin islands and owns a smaller one in new jersey it sells gasoline through more than one thousand gas stations primarily in the eastern united states a thirdgeneration oil and gas businessman john hess took over the company in  from his father leon hess following his fathers death john hess found himself walking in the footsteps of a giant a patriarchs american dream mores hess leons father was a lithuanian immigrant trained to be a kosher butcher who also ran a fueldelivery business coal yard and gas station his business faltered during the depression leon hess was a delivery boy for his father when he took over the bankrupt company in  he began building the company with a product for which other oil companies had little use no  residual fuel oil a black tarry substance left over after refining hess saw that utilities and other big users were switching from coal to no  when they could get it and he built a fleet of trucks capable of keeping the fuel oil warm until delivery gradually expanding his reach far beyond new jersey and new york by  leon hess had  trucks and was able to build his first oil terminal at perth amboy new jersey the oil terminal expanded during world war ii while leon hess served in the us army under general george patton ultimately hess landed at normandy just after dday and was wounded following the war hess returned to work and by  had bought an oil terminal in houston by  the company started crude oil exploration and production in mississippi buying both a pipeline and petroleum reserves in  hess acquired a refinery in corpus christi texas and then built the biggest project of his life the virgin islands refinery in  the company merged with amerada petroleum to create amerada hess by the time of his death in  leon hesss personal stock holdings were worth more than  million leon hess granted only one interview over his year career during which he said my parents always told me to guard my reputation i was brought up all my life to stay out of the limelight and im never going to change  newsday  january   a privileged childhood while john hess grew up with many of the trappings of wealth he still pumped gas for the family hess stations the only son among three siblings he joined his father on foreign oil fields at age seven and began working for the family business in  as a graduate trainee as a harvard undergraduate he studied in beirut became fluent in arabic and farsi and later befriended middle eastern oil ministers by  he was a senior vice president managing exploration and production operations and contributing to the development of fields in canada and the gulf of mexico at a  event bringing together various leaders in the oil industry he introduced abu dhabis oil minister mana said alotaiba in faultless arab dialect by  he was earning  a year and being groomed to succeed his father william p tavoulareas retired president of mobil corporation said he had confidence in his abilities but added how can any son follow an act like that  businessweek  june   a father passes the reins from  to  amerada hess struggled with erratic performance that seemed attributable to leon hesss advancing age the firm had a  million loss in  as sales dropped to  billion a rebound in  was modest a  million net on  billion in sales in s opening quarter hess earned just  million on  billion in sales down from the previous year like his father before him leon hess worked well past  at a press conference during which he passed the torch to his son leon hess wept and said you have a good young management team in place  platts oilgram news  may   oil analysts noted that a change of management was long overdue at the company lehman brothers oil analyst bernard picchi stated its fair to say that the company has been a little out of step with the rest of the industry he noted the companys parochial and inward looking way of operating and how this extended even to its representation in trade associations  platts oilgram news  may   john hess was cut from a different cloth than his father he had an ivy league education while his father never went to college he also had a lot in common with his predecessor including a competitive spirit and fierce work ethic said nicholas brady a board member of amerada hess and a former treasury secretary like his father john is tireless theyre the same in their preoccupation with business its a way of life for john  new york times  may   another trait that hess shared with his father was an aversion to the media both routinely turned down requests for interviews john hess quickly and quietly emerged as the antithesis to the modern highprofile ceo of a leading publicly traded company although john hess was thought to be very close to his father who was the best man at his wedding the relationship had a drawback hess may have had the title and control of the firm but from  to  he was still symbolically under the shadow of his father who controlled  percent of hess stock compared with his sons  percent said eugene l nowak oil analyst with dean witter reynolds leon is not going to fade away  businessweek  may   the shadow receded when leon hess died on may   of complications from blood disease at the age of  a change in course after taking over the daytoday responsibilities of the company john hess crafted a plan to put a new face on the company moving away from the less profitable business of refining and marketing and shifting more business into oil production the company was in dire need of a new direction in  it lost  million on revenues of  billion in  hess attempted to seize a piece of the international oil arena with a takeover bid for ukbased independent oil company lasmo but failed after losing out to a competitor it was a major setback for hess he seemed to recover in  with the companys agreement to buy the exploration and production company triton energy and its stakes in latin america africa and southeast asia hess bought triton energy for  billion in cash and about  million in assumed debt said gene nowak analyst with abn amro initially investors were concerned john hess was going to continue to tilt the company into refining and marketing which is traditionally a lowreturn business but he has strongly tilted the company to exploration and production this deal puts over  percent of its assets into that sector  lloyds list  july   in  however elements of the triton deal came back to haunt john hess the company announced a  million aftertax impairment charge related to the triton acquisition ubs warburg analyst matthew warburton placed part of the blame on triton which he said made poor decisions regarding reservoir mechanics and field management moreover warburton also cited hesss failure to do its homework in evaluating tritons value noting that hess had written off  percent of the value of the total price paid for triton see also entry on amerada hess corporation in international directory of company histories  sources for further information ceiba field triton deal haunt hess

because it is owned by a jewish family  claim   hess oil does not buy product from middle eastern countries because it is “owned by a jewish family” false example   collected on the internet  there is documented evidence that companies like exxon mobil shell and many others buy their oil from the arab countries that support terrorism like iraq and saudi arabia b u t…there is a company called hess gas not only have i checked them out with a chemical engineer i met on a plane but he told me hess produces a quality product based on the caliber of oil hess buys now the “punchline” you are saying why wouldn’t hess buy from those companies b e c a u s e………… hess gas is owned by hess oil company and hess oil company is owned by a jewish family that supports israel and its battle for survival tell your friends to check out the closest hess station to their residence or business and patronize them send this message on to your friends that sympathize with israel and oppose terrorism   origins   hess oil technically known as the amerada hess corporation since a  merger between hess oil  chemical corp and amerada petroleum was founded by leon hess the son of a jewish hungarian immigrant in  hess sold a tow truck given to him by his father bought a gallon chevrolet truck and began selling heating oil in asbury park new jersey from those humble beginnings hess and his father established the hess oil  chemical corp which by  had become a  billion corporation and the thlargest us oil company and now includes among its operations about  retail gasoline stations primarily in new york new jersey and florida leon hess who was also the sole owner of the new york jets football team died in  at age  and his son john b hess now serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of amerada hess it is true that hess has little or no dealings with middle eastern countries as their exploration and production activities take place primarily in the united states the united kingdom norway denmark equatorial guinea gabon algeria thailand malaysia indonesia azerbaijan brazil and colombia however it is not quite accurate to claim that hess “doesn’t buy” from middle eastern companies because it is “owned by a jewish family” although john hess serves as chairman and ceo of amerada hess the company is publicly traded and therefore is “owned” by a variety of stockholders not a single family moreover amerada hess does not have a policy of not dealing with middle eastern companies as a show of support or sympathy for israel but simply because they have no established exploration or production facilities in that part of the world the same is true of some other large oil companies such as sinclair and sunoco consumers wishing to purchase gasoline from retailers whose product does not originate in middle eastern countries can accomplish their goal by patronizing hess service stations of course but not because hess has a corporate policy of supporting israel last updated    june  sources     needell paul   “oil baron presided over his jets ‘family’”     the newark starledger    may    p  got a tip or a rumor contact us here get daily

different cloth than his father he had an ivy league education while his father never went to college he also had a lot in common with his predecessor including a competitive spirit and fierce work ethic said nicholas brady a board member of amerada hess and a former treasury secretary like his father john is tireless theyre the same in their preoccupation with business its a way of life for john new york times may   another trait that hess shared with his father was an aversion to the media both routinely turned down requests for interviews john hess quickly and quietly emerged as the antithesis to the modern highprofile ceo of a leading publicly traded company although john hess was thought to be very close to his father who was the best man at his wedding the relationship had a drawback hess may have had the title and control of the firm but from  to  he was still symbolically under the shadow of his father who controlled  percent of hess stock compared with his sons

piece of the international oil arena with a takeover bid for ukbased independent oil company lasmo but failed after losing out to a competitor it was a major setback for hess he seemed to recover in  with the companys agreement to buy the exploration and production company triton energy and its stakes in latin america africa and southeast asia hess bought triton energy for  billion in cash and about  million in assumed debt said gene nowak analyst with abn amro initially investors were concerned john hess was going to continue to tilt the company into refining and marketing which is traditionally a lowreturn business but he has strongly tilted the company to exploration and production this deal puts over  percent of its assets into that sector lloyds list july   in  however elements of the triton deal came back to haunt john hess the company announced a  million aftertax impairment charge related to the triton acquisition ubs warburg analyst matthew warburton placed part of the blame on triton which he said made poor decisions regarding reservoir mechanics and field management moreover warburton also cited hesss failure to do its homework in evaluating tritons value

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
