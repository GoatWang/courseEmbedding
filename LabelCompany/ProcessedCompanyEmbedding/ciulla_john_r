aspect to it theres a riskmanagement side and its good for societywithin a few years after working at peoples united banks predecessor for several more ciulla pursued his fordham university law degree

lawyer hes got an mba he brought a perspective on commercial banking that we may not have had beforewebster connectionsciulla said it was savage jerry plushs successor as websters president in  who recruited him back to connecticut to work there savage had devoted much of his banking career doing specialized lending expertise ciulla says hes tried to leverage more of within websterjohn has all the intellect and energy quotient youd expect but most importantly he checks his ego at the door and most impressively he does the right thing always savage said via email he is the real deal as bankers we must first judge a borrowers character and capacity john has the smarts and perceptual abilities to do both for instance ciulla launched several industry specialty groups such as a mediatelecommunications unit which webster commercial bankers mine for customer transaction and loan businessits been a differentiator for us ciulla said we were a thrift initially in the last  to  years weve evolved the bank into a fullservice regional commercial bank we think more like a large commercial bank than we have previouslywebster has the footprint to prove it starting with its expansion into the boston commercial market in  first with a commercial loan office webster later moved into westchester county ny before establishing its new york city beachheadbut it was in  with the first signs of a mounting crisis in the securitized homemortgage sector as well as cracks in the us economy that ciulla was named websters chief creditrisk officer that put him in charge of among other things ensuring webster didnt place too many badcredit betson his watch webster undertook an extensive review of its credit policies revising and updating as necessary ciulla said the bank also implemented a new creditmanagement information system to more timely and efficiently monitor its credit risks finally webster took a closer look at all of its lines of business and exited some like

investor warburg pincus reaped dividends cashing in on stock warrants whose value climbed as the bank and the economy recoveredboth the financial upheaval and recession still echo with ciullait changed the regulatory landscape and made it more difficult to operate he said if anything it validated how webster in good times and bad stayed with its customers we helped stabilize the economies in the markets where we operated and certainly our customers by providing them with liquidity and productsafter helping stabilize websters balance sheet and recasting its lending model as creditrisk chief ciulla moved back to the lending side where he had a hand in again expanding its footprint this time into manhattan philadelphia and washington dcjohn has a good balance between having the
