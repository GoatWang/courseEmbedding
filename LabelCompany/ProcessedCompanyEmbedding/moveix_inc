reduced risks and better data quality – these longpromised benefits of xbrl are finally becoming a reality as the xbrl landscape continues its swift evolution we discussed the latest developments with five experts – as well as with a representative of the sec  vintage question  in june the sec announced that it would start accepting structured financial data in the inline xbrl ixbrl format what do you see as the main benefits and challenges of this new format jaret klekota  as with anything new there are going to be challenges making sure that companies understand what all the requirements are and what changes there are between their current process and the ixbrl process for example there are “hidden tags” in ixbrl – companies need to understand what this means and what they should be doing in that area since the sec says that companies should really be focusing on the quality of the data having the xbrl embedded into the html financial filing could free up companies from making sure the statement was rendering on the previewer in the same way as the html and instead focus on appropriate tagging ixbrl can help them embrace and streamline that review process since there will no longer be two separate documents to compare and try to identify the differences between them for now filing the ixbrl version is voluntary but i think there’s going to be a gradual increase in filings some may wait a bit longer in the process to see how it goes and also wait until they are more comfortable around the requirements before filing ilya vadeiko  in our opinion the benefits are huge and obvious if regular xbrl requires separate reporting and creates a significant duplication of work for auditors and filers – as well as gaps in logic – ixbrl eliminates the separation between traditional html and new xbrl formats as jaret mentions this solves many existing problems in terms of consistency and accuracy in terms of implementation i would guess that this would require a fusion or transformation of old html and new xbrl reporting processes and procedures this may be challenging for large filers who have already established such parallel procedures hudson hollister  for companies that have adopted disclosure management software which is most of them it does not take any additional effort to report using ixbrl but as jaret points out this is currently voluntary companies can continue reporting two versions of the financial statements if they want to and many companies have created a review process that assumes two versions they have some people in charge of reviewing the document and other people in charge of reviewing the data even though that might be less efficient it is not without cost to change the process many companies are so busy with the compliance that they might not bother of course we would say that in the long run companies should take advantage of this opportunity to combine those review processes because it will get them ready for when the sec moves to mandatory ixbrl – and we think the commission will make it mandatory some leaders inside the sec are hoping to propose a move to mandatory within the next year the reason for moving to mandatory ixbrl is beyond just fixing the problem with the financial statement itself inline will allow huge progress think about the q and the k — right now these documents are lengthy and there is so much in them that could be structured but isn’t for example the cover page of the q and the k have checkboxes that say what kind of company the filer is right now those checkboxes are not connected to any database if the sec switched to using data fields instead of the document form they could have a field that says “check the box for which type of company you are” and we could automatically generate a list of the all the wellknown seasoned issuers campbell pryde  most of the work for ixbrl should be done by software and so one of the challenges is making sure that the

in top underwriters how is your cacm iq you know the sayonpay ratio math thing posted on october    leave a comment understanding and calculating your consistently applied compensation measure may seem a tad premature seeing how your company does not need to disclose its pay ratio in this fye of december  ’s annual reports and proxy materials for most companies these disclosures must be included in annual reports and proxy statements beginning fye for the first fiscal year beginning on or after december   that means you need to work this math very soon and the cacm should be a consideration as you’re making  compensation decisions per sullivan  crowell llp “companies may find it helpful to conduct dryruns of the calculation based on past compensation data in order to develop an appropriate methodology identify and resolve interpretive practical or disclosure issues and ensure that systems are in place to capture information necessary to support the chosen methodology companies should also be mindful that the pay ratio rule requires disclosure of the methodology used to determine the median employee and any material assumptions adjustments or estimates used to identify the median employee or to determine total compensation” on wednesday the sec’s division of corporation finance posted five new cdis faqs to help us public companies further work their the pay ratio disclosure cacms question if a registrant does not use annual total compensation calculated using item cx of regulation sk “annual total compensation” to identify the median employee how should a registrant select another consistently applied compensation measure “cacm” to identify the median employee question may a registrant exclusively use hourly or annual rates of pay as its cacm question when a registrant uses a cacm to identify the median employee what time period may it use must the period include the date on which the employee population is determined must it always be for an annual period may it use the prior fiscal year question when someone is furloughed on the date that the registrant uses to determine the population of its employees from which it is required to identify the median must the registrant include the furloughed person in the employee population used to identify the median employee and if included in the population how should the furloughed employee’s compensation be calculated question under what circumstances is a worker employed and his or her compensation determined by an unaffiliated third party such that the worker is considered an independent contractor or leased worker under the rule when is a registrant considered to be determining the compensation of a worker you can read their answers here also ask your securities law firm

stateofthexbrlunion today posted on october     comment  extensible business reporting language is becoming mainstream as costs stabilize data quality improves and investor analysis capabilities expand substantially greater transparency lower filing costs reduced risks and better data quality – these longpromised benefits of xbrl are finally becoming a reality how can issuer and investors take full advantage when the xbrl data reporting standard became mandatory in  optimism reigned that structured data would allow for vast analytical possibilities businesses regulators and investors would be able to compare data across public companies at the push of a button reality quickly set in however the us securities and exchange commission sec did not enforce high data quality filers created huge numbers of confusing extensions and data providers often ignored the filings as a result thankfully in recent years the situation has improved dramatically “through initiatives such as the xbrl us data quality committee the integrity of business information filed through xbrl has become significantly better slowly but surely the huge potential of the reporting language is beginning to be realized” commented liam power president at vintage a pr newswire division perhaps the most critical development of  has been the announcement by the sec in june that it would allow companies to use inline xbrl or ixbrl to file their quarterly and annual financial statements this version allows companies to file financial information in a single document instead of keeping the traditional and xbrl versions separate eventually the hope is that this will reduce complexity for filers as well as the risk of error at the same time data aggregators are starting to make full use of xbrl data having found ways to clean up errors and manage extensions this has opened up a great treasure trove of information for investors and businesses as the xbrl landscape continues its swift evolution we
