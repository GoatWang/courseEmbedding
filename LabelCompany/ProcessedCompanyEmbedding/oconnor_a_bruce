process for the mainbody housing of the oconnor  pan and tilt head in our products we use some of the most pacing mechanical manufacturing technologies such as the latest advances mim to technologies such as investment casting developed in ancient egypt over  years ago the mainbody is the main hub around which everything is built it houses the fluid drag chambers and pan and tilt bearings as well as acting as the base for mounting the counterbalance mechanism the video starts with the melting of the magnesium alloy ingots and the construction of the sand moulds from an array of patterns and core boxes the cope and drag are assembled and the casting poured the casting is then extracted runners and risers are cut off and the casting is fettled and heat treated for strength in preparation for machining the castings are then loaded into a high speed horizontal nc milling machine to be cut to its final tightly tolerance dimensions being inspected carefully along the way the machined part is then carefully deburred before being sent off for coating this coating stops the magnesium corroding and also provides a key for the hard epoxy paint once painted the casting is ready for final assembly and testing if you want more detail on this or have any questions please go to our ‘ask oconnor’ section steve turner meng product manager inspiration  cinematographers and directors of

flannery o’connor’s mark on bruce springsteen dappledthingsorga quarterly journal of ideas art and faithfacebookrsstwitter naming sin flannery o’connor’s mark on bruce springsteen dappled thingsdamian j ference not so long ago bruce springsteen made a surprise visit to the rock and roll hall of fame and museum in cleveland to take in an exhibit dedicated to his life’s work the exhibit which took up two entire floors of the museum was filled with artifacts from springsteen’s life including guitars clothing handwritten lyrics and walls of photographs one of the photographs was of an eight yearold springsteen standing with hands folded in front of the high altar at st rose of lima catholic church in freehold new jersey—springsteen’s first communion picture bruce springsteen’s relationship with the catholic church may have reached its peak on his first communion day he writes “in the third grade a nun stuffed me in a garbage can under her desk because she said that’s where i belonged i also had the distinction of being the only altar boy knocked down by a priest during mass” by the time he made his confirmation the sacrament which is supposed to seal you with the gifts of the holy spirit in order to spread the gospel to all corners of the earth springsteen had had enough in his words “i quit the stuff religion when i was in eighth grade by the time you’re older than  it’s too ludicrous to go along with anymore by the time i was in eighth grade i just lost it all” but in reality he didn’t lose it all he may have stopped going to mass and formally practicing his faith but the catholic worldview he received through his family and the sisters at st rose’s never left him however it would take another cradle catholic to help him understand appreciate and develop his sacramental imagination and his worldview enter flannery o’connor original sin as the first principle unlike flannery o’connor who grew up in a catholic home that encouraged reading from a very early age springsteen never read much growing up he notes “i wasn’t brought up in a house where there was a lot of reading and stuff i was brought up on tv” it wasn’t until much later in life that he would begin to take books seriously and o’connor was one of the authors whose work resonated with him most specifically her view of human nature and the world in an interview with walker percy’s nephew springsteen explains his initial draw to o’connor “the really important reading that i did began in my late twenties with authors like flannery o’connor there was something in those stories of hers that i felt captured a certain part of the american character that iwas interested in writing about they were a big big revelation” that something about o’connor’s art that resonated so deeply with springsteen was twofold first o’connor is a master storyteller she notes “a story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way and it takes every word in the story to say what the meaning is” this too was springsteen’s principle and the principle of every good storyteller show don’t tell second o’connor was able to identify a reality present in the world that spoke directly to springsteen’s catholic imagination—she had an uncanny ability of naming sin according to o’connor without sin you have no story or you have a very bad story she notes the serious writer has always taken the flaw in human nature for his starting point usually the flaw in an otherwise admirable character drama usually bases itself on the bedrock of original sin whether the writer thinks in theological terms or not the christian novelist is distinguished from his pagan colleagues by recognizing sin as sin” for o’connor the world is fallen and this fallenness is not the consequence of an accident or the environment but the direct result of humankind’s deliberate turning away from god it is the doctrine of original sin original sin then is the backdrop against which o’connor writes she believes that humankind is fallen and is in need of a savior and she offers no apology for such a view she professes“i am no disbeliever in spiritual purpose and no vague believer i see from the standpoint of christian orthodoxy this means that for me the meaning of life is centered in our redemption by christ and what i see in the world i see in its relation to that” o’connor’s ability to look out to the world to see and name sin and the longing of every human heart to be rescued from that curse would leave an indelible mark on springsteen as a man and as a storyteller he explains she got to the heart of some part of meanness that she never spelled out because if she spelled it out you wouldn’t be getting it it was always at the core of every one of her stories– the way that she’d left that hole there that hole that’s inside of everybody there was some dark thing—a component of spirituality—that i sensed in her stories and that set me off exploring characters of my own she knew original sin—she knew how to give it the flesh of the story springsteen recognized a worldview ubiquitous in o’connor’s writing that he deemed not only probable but true from his days of studying the baltimore catechism at st rose’s grade school he would have been taught that “sin is divided into the sin we inherit called original sin and the sin we commit ourselves called actual sin” o’connor was able to incarnate this doctrine of sin to make it believable through characters in her stories she knew that sin was not a definition to be memorized by students in catholic schools but that it was an undeniable reality which is the starting point of understanding the human drama she notes that “the greatest dramas naturally involve the salvation or loss of the soul where there is no belief in the soul there is very little drama” this then is the mark that o’connor made on springsteen she taught him that a good story is always told against the backdrop of original sin and that without sin you have no story four manifestations of the mark o’connor’s influence on springsteen can be recognized in four particular ways  that a definite change occurred in the themes of springsteen’s songs and development of his characters as a result of reading o’connor’s short stories  that springsteen directly references o’connor’s work in his style song lyrics and album titles  that springsteen holds an unapologetic view of original sin as a ‘first principle’ in his songwriting and  that although springsteen has personally struggled in his relationship with the catholic church he has not rejected the fundamental doctrines of christianity which according to o’connor are essential to good writing springsteen began reading o’connor’s stories in his late twenties which was at same the time he was working on darkness on the edge of town released in  in his review of darkness in rolling stone paul nelson writes “many of the characters in the songs on bruce springsteen’s new album appear to be trapped in a state of desperation so intense that they must either break through to something better or at least into something ambiguous or break down into madness murder or worse” in the words of o’connor “either one is serious about salvation or one is not”  springsteen wrote over seventy songs for the darkness album and many of those songs appeared on his next album the river of course one wonders whether springsteen pulled the album title directly from o’connor’s story of the same name it seems a safe bet especially since he also penned a song during that same period entitled “a good man is hard to find”  in  springsteen released nebraska which more than any of his other albums sounds like o’connor even the reviews that the album received sounded like reviews of o’connor’s stories “startling direct and chilling” springsteen explains “at home just before recording nebraska i was reading flannery o’connor her stories reminded me of the unknowability of god and contained a dark spirituality that resonated with my feeling at the time” this theme of god’s unknowability was mistakenly understood by some reviewers as nihilism especially in reference to the last track on the album “reason to believe” where in the first verse a man pokes a dead dog with a stick in an attempt to revive it in the second verse another man leaves his wife who waits for him every day down at the end of a dirt road in the third an old man dies in a whitewashed shotgun shack and in the final verse a groom stood up at his riverside wedding stands alone and wonders where his bride might be like o’connor springsteen is no nihilist and neither is he naïve springsteen recognizes that sin is present in the world and whether we recognize it or not it affects all of us yet once recognized it is ours to determine how we will respond to it in the story “a good man is hard to find” the misfit tells the grandmother that everyone has a choice to make for life which is following jesus or for death which is doing whatever you want—sin the misf t says he jesus thown everything off balance if he did what he said he did then it’s nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow him and if he didn’t then it’s nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can—by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him no pleasure but meanness for o’connor meanness is sin this meanness is precisely the reason that springsteen gives when explaining why the narrator in the song “nebraska” killed ten innocent people he confesses“they wanted to know why i did what i did well sir i guess there’s just a meanness in this world” again this meanness isn’t random it is a consequence of the fall and it is something that every human being must respond to either by turning away from it or by embracing it although o’connor’s most direct influence on springsteen is presented on nebraska his songwriting after reading o’connor consistently accounts for the presence of sin—a meanness in thisworld—as a backdrop and a first principle for his narrative on every one of his albums since nebraska springsteen has continued to tell stories of men and women wrestling with original sin and its consequences which are manifested in narratives of isolation infidelity injustice robbery terrorism murder and death yet as o’connor notes “there is something in us as storytellers and listeners to stories that demands the redemptive act that demandsthat what falls at least be offered the chance to be restored” springsteen like o’connor before him also deals with thethemes of redemption and salvation as a remedy to sin in his writing but the essential point here is to recognize that there can be no redemption and no salvation without first acknowledging the power the presence and the reality of sin as a first principleand starting point but the question remains does springsteen’s worldview specifically his recognition of sin make him a catholic writer even though he does not practice his catholic faith and admits to being the father of three “pagan babies” it is a difficult question yet by o’connor’s description of what a catholic writer is it seems that springsteen meets her standards in her essay on the catholic novelist “novelist and believer” o’connor offers her best explanation of what it means to be a catholic writer of course bruce springsteen is a songwriter not a novelist but this distinction does not change the substance of her argument she writes the writer whose vocation is fiction sees his obligation as being to the truth of what can happen in life    the catholic novelist doesn’t have to be a saint he doesn’t even have to be a catholic he does unfortunately have to be a novelist this doesn’t mean that the writer should lack moral vision but i think that to understand what it does mean we have to consider for a while what fiction—novel or story—is and what would give a piece of fiction the right to have the adjective “catholic” applied to it within her description o’connor seems to point to two components that make one a catholic writer the first is that the writer sees the world as it is and the second is that the writer be good at writing springsteen undoubtedly meets both requirements bruce springsteen does see his obligation as a songwriter “as being to the truth of what can happen in life” he observes“writers and artists create little worlds and control them you do that well enough you begin to believe you can live in one of them but the real world doesn’t work that way” in other words springsteen doesn’t create a new world for his characters to live in he actually writes his characters into the fallen world—the real world this is precisely what o’connor meant when she described a catholic novel or in our case a catholic song as“one that represents reality adequately as we see it manifested in this world of things and human relationships only in and by these experiences does the fiction writer approach the contemplative knowledge of the mystery they embody”  second springsteen is a great songwriter as is witnessed by exceptionally favorable reviews of his records and his induction into the rock and roll hall of fame not to mention his academyawards grammy awards record sales concert sales and faithful fanbase  meeting both of o’connor’s requirements as one who sees the world as it is and being a good writer would make it safe to give springsteen the distinction of “catholic writer” and as a matter of fact springsteen would not argue with this title as he himself has explained that there are three reasons he writes the way he does “catholic school catholic school catholic school” of course he also admits that o’connor was the one who helped rekindle those fundamental doctrines of christianity he learned as a child in order to make them a part of his songwriting specifically the doctrine of original sin the tradition continued flannery o’connor served bruce springsteen as a bearer of a long tradition of naming sin which she inherited from reading the bible as well as the works of augustine aquinas dostoevsky joyce maritan gilson and chardin to name but a few through her short stories o’connor passed on her worldview to springsteen which made a significant mark on his song writing and which continues to influence the likes of u lucinda williams pattygriffin josh ritter arcade fire and other contemporary artists who also recognize the fallen world and write good music about it and although it is true that springsteen may not be a saint he continues to be a great catholic songwriter he proudly professes that flannery o’connor left her mark on him the ability to name

o’connor i agree with your assessment of o’connor’s influence on bruce’s work it would be wonderful if springsteen continued to push himself to write songs of the same caliber as those on his earlier albums o’connor never lowered her standards but springsteen seems to be resting on his laurels with his last few offerings maybe he’s no longer capable of being great but this article reminds me that he once was erik says march   at  am interesting article thank you so much i started reading o’connor because of the percy interview this might interest you as well especially this week httperikbuyswordpresscom00brucespringsteenspassion cheers annf says may   at 0 am i was never a fan of springsteen though many of my friends growing up in the youngstown oh area loved him for identifying with the bluecollar steeltown types in later years i grew to dislike him even more for his politics now living in cleveland i would see the billboards for the rock hall exhibition and think “not if you paid me to go” however i adore flannery o’connor and i have to say all political and musical tastes aside this article gives me a greater appreciation for him as an artist and a writer that quote from a good man is hard to find contain some of the best words ever written and the river oh–what words can you use to describe that story springsteen loves flannery ok i will no longer grimace when i hear his music and i might even listen for a minute to see if i can detect a bit of southern catholicism seeping through matthew says may   at  am annf tell me that “thunder road” isn’t beautiful 🙂 paul says october   at  pm jungleland even mike says may   at 0 pm listen to the song “land of hope and dreams” or anything on the new “wrecking ball” except that song and you’ll get an appreciation for an artist who is not “resting on his laurels” i can’t think of another classic rock artist who has stayed relevant for 0 plus years bruce is a great writer and a an even greater performer this article was really wonderful to read and i even found out about flannery o’connor which i knew nothing of thanks los angeles car title loan refinancing says december   at  pm

small portable generator one of my favourite locations was a beautiful th century farmhouse that features quite heavily in the story  being an old building it is very small and dark but looks absolutely amazing on camera full of texture and the kind of character that only  years of being lived in can give with this in mind i opted for a set of led inca fresnel lights from litepanels they have such a clean quality of light output that they seamlessly blend with the practical lighting that i like to use  all in a package that draws such little power and generates almost no heat how vitec kit supported the production i always work with oconnor heads and i’m a big fan of the  it’s lightweight and has such great balance and reliable movement that it really has become an extension of my arm i always know what i’m going to be able to do with it the litepanels led fresnels and xs combined with antonbauer batteries really gave me a lot of versatility and the ability to move quickly between setups and locations in one big night exterior we were quite far from the house but i wanted the interior lights to carry so i placed three inca s in the rooms pushing out around k of light from each unit and only drawing around w  i was able to power them from the house and leave the lamps in very small rooms with no fear of fire we also had a lot of night car interior shots and i turned to the croma kit from litepanels a beautifully packaged lamp that can be set almost anywhere  it’s completely dimmable and the colour temperature can be dialled from daylight to tungsten  i opted for somewhere in between at around k and got some stunning results  the croma lamps have incredible run time from aa batteries biographybruce melhuish is an awardwinning director of photography

everything that rises  bruce springsteen the ghost of flannery oconnor tweets by etrgucomments or questions about this blog send an email message to everythingthatrisesgeorgetowneduby paul eliefrom georgetown universitybruce springsteen the ghost of flannery oconnora few years ago rolling stone ran the above photograph of “bruce’s retreat” – the room in his house in rumsen new jersey where he reads and writes  as printed in the magazine the photograph was just enough of a closeup that you could make out a few of the books  i know this because a friend told me that he was sure he could see my first book there on the boss’s shelf  reader i used a magnifying glass … but no the book wasn’t mine dammit it was another book with a blackandgold spinenow we have springsteen’s current reading tastes from a more reliable authority his own  for those of us who have kept up with his catholically canonical favorite books there are no great surprises in the times’s brief “by the book” einterview not even the fact that he wrote “the ghost of tom joad” before reading the grapes of wrath – no surprises that is except for the stress that he still puts on flannery oconnor’s influence more than a third of a century after his first encounter with herthat was when at age  he started reading seriously for the first time oconnor james m cain john cheever sherwood anderson and jim thompsonthese authors contributed greatly to the turn my music took around  they brought out a sense of geography and the dark strain in my writing broadened my horizons about what might be accomplished with a pop song and are still the cornerstone literally for what i try to accomplish todaythese authors – but oconnor in particular asked which one book – which one author – made him who he is he explainsone would be difficult but the short stories of flannery o’connor landed hard on me you could feel within them the unknowability of god the intangible mysteries of life that confounded her characters and which i find by my side every day they contained the dark gothicness of my childhood and yet made me feel fortunate to sit at the center of this swirling black puzzle stars reeling overhead the earth barely beneath uslittleknown fact in the last months of his life walker percy prompted by his nephew will wrote what he called a “fan letter of sorts” to springsteen – whom he called “one of the few sane guys in your field”  he asked the boss about “your spiritual journey” and in particular about “your admiration for flannery oconnor she was a dear friend of mine” he told springsteen “though a more heroic catholic than i”in a  interview in doubletake it figures into the life you save may be your own springsteen told the nephew what oconnor meant to him in the voice familiar from his long onmike introductions to songs like “the promised land”there was something in those stories of hers that i felt captured a certain part of the american character that i was interested in writing about they were a big big revelation … there was some dark thing – a component of spirituality – that i sensed in her stories and that sent me off exploring on my ownand me on mine  and you on yours – as with whitman’s leaves of grass which springsteen likes to read on a summer’s day on the front porch    november literature and beliefflannery oconnorbruce springsteenwalker
