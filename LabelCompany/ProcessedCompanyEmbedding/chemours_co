chatsko tmfblackngold jun   at am it has been a fantastic year for specialty chemical manufacturer chemours nysecc the stock is up  year to date part of those gains is due to improving market conditions for its leading product groups titanium dioxide and fluoroproducts the company increased manufacturing volumes and prices in the first quarter of  which pushed operating income for the period higher than the previous eight quarters combined not bad  the other part of the stocks gain this year is owed to the removal of legal uncertainty in february chemours and dupont nysedd announced they had reached a  million settlement with thousands of residents in ohio and west virginia relating to chemical pollution of waterways while thats a relatively large amount investors and funds were fearing a much larger financial agreement in the court battle that lasted over a decade which had put downward pressure on the stock now that the issue is resolved and market conditions for its lead products are improving wall street doesnt appear to have any reservations unfortunately that is probably all about to change image source getty images socially responsible investors beware the legal settlement centers on a highly toxic chemical known as pfoa which was previously used in the united states to manufacture various fluoroproducts including the famous nonstick coating teflon while it had been used since the s it only drew the scrutiny of scientists and public health officials in the last  years it has since been strongly linked to a host of health issues including pregnancyinduced hypertension kidney cancer testicular cancer thyroid disease ulcerative colitis and even high cholesterol the lawsuit was specifically for the companys washington west virginia fluoroproduct facility which is one of nine in the united states operated by chemours and one of  it owns globally  the us environmental protection agency eventually took action essentially forcing american chemical manufacturers to stop using pfoa by the end of  it also set a recommended exposure limit in drinking water to  parts per billion to put that  and the dire health concerns of pfoa  into perspective the epa exposure limit for lead in drinking water is  ppb  while its another unfortunate example of the unknown risks of legacy chemicals from the th century that are rarely tested by the epa chemours and dupont have wall street thinking that the legal settlement announced in february is the end of the story after all they say they no longer use nor create pfoa during the manufacturing of fluoroproducts a report in a local newspaper in north carolina should make investors begin to reconsider the risks posed to the business from its fluoroproducts manufacturing operations which make significant contributions to the overall business metric q  q   change titanium technologies revenue  million  million  fluoroproducts revenue  million  million  chemical solutions revenue  million  million  titanium technologies adjusted ebitda  million  million  fluoroproducts adjusted ebitda  million  million  chemical solutions adjusted ebitda  million  million  data source sec filings  on june  the port city daily shed more light on an ongoing dispute between the epa and a chemical manufacturing site in fayetteville north carolina that is discharging high levels of pfoa into the local waterways three companies share a wastewater facility and wastewater permit at the site kuraray dupont and chemours in fact theres only one pipe discharging processed water from the site into the local waterways which is making it difficult to tell exactly who is responsible some simple deduction points a finger in one direction dupont is only listed on the permit because it was the predecessor to chemours which still manufactures fluoroproducts at the site meanwhile kuraray acquired laminated glass manufacturing facilities at the site from dupont but those production processes dont use pfoa according to the company that only leaves one possible polluter this may be a he said she said dispute at the moment but even if kuraray is the culprit in the end chemours investors shouldnt breathe a sigh of relief just yet there are two reasons first chemours and dupont could still face legal cases for other fluoroproduct manufacturing sites in the united states or elsewhere in the world namely in europe brazil and asia the  million settlement reached in february only covered one manufacturing site  cc data by ycharts second the cape fear watershed in north carolina  where the fayetteville site discharges water  has become a hotspot for studying the new chemicals being used to replace pfoa for dupont and chemours thats usually a chemical they call genx which is similar to pfoa and not as well studied  what is available in the scientific literature isnt adding up very favorably for chemours scientists from respected universities and the even the epa have found levels of genx in cape fear that greatly exceed levels of pfoa which still exceed epamandated limits while research on the possible health effects of genx is underway it has demonstrated toxicity in lab animal studies that warrants additional study the epa even raised concerns about the chemical stating that it will persist in the environment could bioaccumulate and be toxic to people wild mammals and birds based on its similarities to pfoa yet the agency approved it for use anyway and currently does not impose drinking water limits for genx  should that happen in the future dupont and chemours could be on the hook for additional fines and legal liabilities the latters fluoroproduct business could also face increased competition if consumers and customers decide to turn away from the unique class of chemicals given their importance and as of today unmatched properties that could be a long shot without harsh restrictions handed down by the epa or international treaties which already exist for fluoroproduct precursors then again there is a precedent for eliminating toxic and environmentally harmful industrial chemicals on a global scale pfoa and its replacements harm both what does it mean for investors the incredible toxicity of pfoa has brought increased regulatory and scientific scrutiny to fluoroproducts and the chemicals used in their production with multiple studies underway researching potential links to gen x and health issues and the similarities to pfoa investors should know that the odds of additional hefty fines or legal settlements are much greater than zero wall street isnt currently pricing this additional risk into the stock but i wouldnt want to be a shareholder when analysts wake up and see storm clouds on
