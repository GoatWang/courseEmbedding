takes approximately  to  minutes to prepare the preparer should have dedicated uninterrupted time to prepare marqibo due to the extensive monitoring of temperature and time required for the preparation aseptic technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in marqibo the preparation steps of marqibo that involve mixing the sodium phosphate injection sphingomyelincholesterol liposome injection and vincristine sulfate injection must be done in a biological safety cabinet or by established pharmacy safety procedures for the preparation of sterile injectable formulations and hazardous drugs however the preparation steps that involve placement of the vial in the water bath must be done outside of the sterile area do not use with inline filters do not mix with other drugs ​water bath process fill a water bath with water to a level of at least  cm  inches measured from the bottom and maintain this minimum water level throughout the

respiratory failure  pulmonary hemorrhage  and sudden cardiac death  drug interactions no formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with marqibo marqibo is expected to interact with drugs known to interact with nonliposomal vincristine sulfate simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included nonliposomal vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of phenytoin and to increase seizure activity cypa interactions vincristine sulfate the active agent in marqibo is a substrate for cytochrome p a isozymes cypa therefore the concomitant use of strong cypa inhibitors should be avoided eg ketoconazole itraconazole voriconazole posaconazole clarithromycin atazanavir indinavir nefazodone nelfinavir ritonavir saquinavir telithromycin similarly the concomitant use of strong cypa inducers should be avoided eg dexamethasone phenytoin carbamazepine rifampin rifabutin rifapentine phenobarbital st johns wort pglycoprotein interactions vincristine sulfate the active agent in marqibo is also a substrate for pglycoprotein pgp the effect of concomitant use of potent pgp inhibitors or inducers has not been investigated it is likely that these agents will alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of marqibo therefore the concomitant use of potent pgp inhibitors or inducers should be avoided use in specific populations pregnancy pregnancy category d see warnings and precautions based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies marqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women if this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus in an embryofetal developmental study pregnant rats were administered vincristine sulfate liposome injection intravenously during the period of organogenesis at vincristine sulfate doses of  to  mgkgday drugrelated adverse effects included fetal malformations skeletal and visceral decreases in fetal weights increased numbers of early resorptions and postimplantation losses and decreased maternal body weights malformations were observed at doses ≥  mgkgday in animals at systemic exposures approximately  of those reported in patients at the recommended dose nursing mothers it is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother pediatric use the safety and effectiveness of marqibo in pediatric patients have not been established geriatric use safety and effectiveness in elderly individuals have not been established in general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy renal impairment the influence of renal impairment on the safety efficacy and pharmacokinetics of marqibo has not been evaluated hepatic impairment nonliposomal vincristine sulfate is excreted primarily by the liver the influence of severe hepatic impairment on the safety and efficacy of marqibo has not been evaluated the pharmacokinetics of marqibo was evaluated in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction childpugh b secondary to melanoma liver metastases the doseadjusted maximum plasma

organ failure  pneumonia and septic shock  respiratory failure  pulmonary hemorrhage  and sudden cardiac death drug interactionsno formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with marqibo marqibo is expected to interact with drugs known to interact with nonliposomal vincristine sulfatesimultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included nonliposomal vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of phenytoin and to increase seizure activitycypa interactionsvincristine sulfate the active agent in marqibo is a substrate for cytochrome p a isozymes cypa therefore the concomitant use of strong cypa inhibitors should be avoided eg ketoconazole itraconazole voriconazole posaconazole clarithromycin atazanavir indinavir nefazodone nelfinavir ritonavir saquinavir telithromycin similarly the concomitant use of strong cypa inducers should be avoided eg dexamethasone phenytoin carbamazepine rifampin rifabutin rifapentine phenobarbital st johns wortpglycoprotein interactionsvincristine sulfate the active agent in marqibo is also a substrate for pglycoprotein pgp the effect of concomitant use of potent pgp inhibitors or inducers has not been investigated it is likely that these agents will alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of marqibo therefore the concomitant use of potent pgp inhibitors or inducers should be avoideduse in specific populationspregnancypregnancy category d see warnings and precautionsbased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies marqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant womenif this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus in an embryofetal developmental study pregnant rats were administered vincristine sulfate liposome injection intravenously during the period of organogenesis at vincristine sulfate doses of  to  mgkgday drugrelated adverse effects included fetal malformations skeletal and visceral decreases in fetal weights increased numbers of early resorptions and postimplantation losses and decreased maternal body weights malformations were observed at doses ≥  mgkgday in animals at systemic exposures approximately  of those reported in patients at the recommended dosenursing mothersit is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the motherpediatric usethe safety and effectiveness of marqibo in pediatric patients have not been establishedgeriatric usesafety and effectiveness in elderly individuals have not been established in general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapyrenal impairmentthe influence of renal impairment on the safety efficacy and pharmacokinetics of marqibo has not been evaluatedhepatic impairmentnonliposomal vincristine sulfate is excreted primarily by the liver the influence of severe hepatic impairment on the safety and efficacy of marqibo has not been evaluated the pharmacokinetics of marqibo was evaluated in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction childpugh b secondary
