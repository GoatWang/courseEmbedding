how information spreads on the internet among other things has raised a  million in funding to further develop its product and expand its team mk capital led the series a round with investments from atlas venture village ventures and high peaks venture partnersthe funding comes as venture investors pour money into the content marketing category in hot pursuit of advertising dollars native advertising pulled in an estimated  billion last year moving the category from “experimental” to become a permanent line item on many advertisers’ budgets earlier this year the sponsored content company newscred raised  million bringing its total funding to 6 million contently and percolate other competitors have raised  million and  million respectively all three startups compete in the category with slightly differentiated offerings simplereach’s position is that it offers marketers a single performance report for all of its branded content spanning several sites and social media channelssimplereach can also claim something few of its competitors can it was founded four years ago long before venture capitalist fred wilson coined “native advertising” and marketers and publishers became obsessed with the term simplereach was doing native advertising before native advertising was coolof course thats no guarantee of success as startup wisdom goes “being early is the same as being wrong” simplereach almost didn’t live to see the heyday of native advertising “we were close to death several times because we were too early to the market” founder edward kim says “we nearly ran out of money a lot of times”the company’s pitch hasn’t changed but simplereach didn’t get the time of day from publishers or brands in its early years “we had to scrape by with super small checks trying to stay alive month to month” kim says times have changed several hundred publishers now use the companys sponsored content platform which costs about  per month for brands to access the most basic version simplereach also takes a cut of any paid promotions of the content forbes which was early to move into branded content was its first client publications including the new york times huffington post the atlantic and yes even fortune followed suit media buyers such as digitaslbi and vivaki as well as companies like intel are spending money to promote their content through simplereachthe company has grown to  employees mostly on its own income it raised  million across several seed rounds the company will now enjoy additional capital to expand its product the “next generation” of content measurement and distribution according to simplereach is being able to show actual return on investment on content for advertisers and brandskim views content marketing as in its early days even though he’s been doing it for four years first the industry was focused on content creation he says the next step just like what happened with online video is that people realize they need distribution “in the early innings people are focused on routing money into workflow management and creating the content now people have that and it’s like wait a minute nobody is reading this” he says surprise that’s where simplereach steps inand what of reports that readers say they hate sponsored content and native advertising kim recites the same line most native advertising advocates tout—disclosure is everything—but also clarifies why native advertising is considered in recent years as the one true answer to both publishers and advertisers it’s the only thing left “it’s the answer by process of elimination” he says banners don’t work on tiny mobile screens so advertisers have to get users’ attention in the main stream of content with native and sponsored content still that disclosure thing is tricky “if you are publisher this is both the greatest thing to happen to you and also most dangerous thing to happen to you” he sayscustomer servicesite mapprivacy
