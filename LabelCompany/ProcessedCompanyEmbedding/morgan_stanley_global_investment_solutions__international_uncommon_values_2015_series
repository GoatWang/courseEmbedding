with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual

values trust  series  business wire morgan stanley launches uncommon values trust  series august    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wiremorgan stanley wealth management recently launched the  series of two unit investment trusts the uncommon values uit and uncommon values growth  income uit the two trusts are based on morgan stanley’s vintage values research report each year morgan stanley’s analysts present the stock ideas they believe most likely to realize superior riskadjusted returns over the next  months to the stock selection committee and research management the committee then determines the final list for the vintage values report based on these presentations “the stocks in the vintage values report reflect the cornerstone strengths of morgan stanley’s analysts their insight into emerging industry trends rigorous bottomup company analysis and their assessment of what they believe to be among the most attractive riskreward profiles — in fact our analysts’ estimates are above street consensus for every stock in the report” said stephen penwell managing director morgan stanley  co north america research the uncommon values uit is a growthoriented portfolio that seeks aboveaverage capital appreciation and the uncommon values growth  income uit is an incomeoriented portfolio that is weighted more heavily toward dividend payers “morgan stanley has been a sponsor in the uit space since  this has enabled us to bring all elements – stock selection portfolio construction and distribution – together under one roof at the firm said colbert narcisse morgan stanley managing director and head of traditional investment products this communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state investors should consider the investment objectives risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing investors should contact a morgan stanley financial advisor or call morgan stanley smith barney llc at  to request a prospectus which contains this and other important portfolio information investors should read it carefully before investing these materials are intended only for morgan stanley smith barney llc clients in the united states and prospective clients in the united states risk considerations choosing an uncommon values uit that is right for you depends on your tolerance for risk among other things as with any equity investment unit prices will fluctuate and there is no assurance that prices will appreciate and not decline over the life of a trust stock prices can be volatile and holders can lose money by investing in a trust in addition the amount of dividends you receive depends on each issuer’s dividend policy the financial condition of the securities and general economic conditions if you invest in a trust you should understand the potential risks associated with common stocks since the trusts’ portfolios include securities of issuers located in foreign markets the trusts may be more affected by the risks of investing in foreign securities which include economic political monetary andor legal factors changing currency exchange rate foreign taxes and differences in financial and accounting standards in addition the trusts’ portfolios invest significantly in one or more sectors because of their narrow focus sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies morgan stanley smith barney llc and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice clients should seek advice based on the taxpayer’s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor each portfolio is a unit investment trust which uses a buy and hold strategy that is designed to remain fixed over its  month life the uit issues redeemable securities or “units” at prices based on net asset value units can be sold at any time at a price that will reflect the net asset value on the date of sale less any remaining deferred sales charge the proceeds may be more or less than the cost you can opt for dividends to be reinvested in additional units or paid out in cash these trusts are part of a longterm strategy and investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge if available while the uncommon values uits are based in part on research published by morgan stanley  co llc research “morgan stanley research” the securities in each trust were selected by morgan stanley smith barney llc its affiliate and sponsor of the trust other than providing research morgan stanley research is not liable for any information contained in the prospectus which it did not provide the trust is not sponsored or endorsed by morgan stanley research morgan stanley research makes no representation or warranty express or implied to the unitholders of the trust or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in units of the trust morgan stanley research has no obligation or liability in connection with the investment decisions made by the sponsor or the trust or in connection with the administration of the trust you should note that the trust may continue to purchase or hold securities notwithstanding the fact that morgan stanley research may have revised its opinion with respect to any individual security based on the selection process employed by morgan stanley research when preparing the original report or any subsequent report in particular any subsequent publication of a similar type of list of securities or an update of any above referenced report by morgan stanley research will not affect the composition of the trust this uit is offered by morgan stanley smith barney llc to its clients exclusively by morgan stanley financial advisors while the compensation payable to your financial advisor on the sale of this unit investment trust is the same as for other unit investment trusts offered by other sponsors morgan stanley smith barney llc receives additional compensation and fees for creating and servicing the trust as sponsor this compensation is a variable percentage of total sales of the trust in addition to a portion of the gross sales charge on total sales that is not payable as compensation to financial advisors these amounts which exceed the amount morgan stanley smith barney llc receives on sales of unit investment trusts from other sponsors may represent a conflict of interest for morgan stanley and its financial advisor when offering the trust the sponsor and its affiliates

investment bank  the reinvention of morgan stanley by clive horwood published on thursday july   under the leadership of james gorman morgan stanley has carved out a unique position in global banking it remains a great investment bank its muchmaligned ficc division now looks fit for purpose and its us wealth management arm gives the firm new stability and strength most important of all the disparate parts of a oncedivided business are delivering the benefits of the whole firm and the markets are starting to realize the potential of a new morgan stanley as well order at the end of every working day james gorman picks up a plastic folder and takes out the top sheet of paper in an era when everything has become electronic the sheet is something of a throwback the half dozen lines that run from top to bottom are handdrawn the spidery numbers within it are written by gorman’s own hand these are the key endofday numbers for morgan stanley the business that gorman runs since he became chief executive in  gorman has religiously written down those numbers more than  times in those  working days and countless weekends besides morgan stanley has been transformed under gorman’s leadership when he took over as ceo the bank had been through a neardeath experience during the financial crisis just two years earlier a big investment from japan’s mufg and the purchase of the smith barney retail business from citi helped to steady the ship but morgan stanley faced two big related problems the markets did not know what the firm was and even many of the firm’s employees weren’t sure what it wanted to be either previous ceo john mack had put the building blocks in place to rebalance the business but the firm under gorman did not deliver for some time margins in the new enlarged wealth management business were in the low teens poor for a division with  trillion in assets while morgan stanley’s advisory and equities divisions continued to perform well quarter after quarter results were hampered by a ficc business that hardly seemed fit for purpose and the investment bank struggled to bring the whole firm to its clients in part because of the uneasy relationship between the two bankers who ran it – ma specialist paul taubman and markets veteran and former cfo of the firm who played a key role in pulling morgan stanley out of the financial crisis colm kelleherthen there was gorman himself the exmckinsey consultant and former head of wealth management at merrill lynch brought in by mack in  to sort out the mess of its own wealth business – itself the legacy of the hated era following the firm’s merger with dean witter discover which many felt had ripped the heart and soul out of a oncegreat franchise it hasn’t been an easy ride gorman admits that even during the first two years of his leadership of the firm many saw him as an outsider “i was acutely aware of it” he says “it was entirely understandable this is a very proud institution” some people clearly thought one of their own should be running the firma crunch point came in february  gorman had bet his career on the new model and needed to convince investors he could not start to do that until he was sure his own staff were onsidehe called a meeting of the firm’s top  senior managers across all business lines the strategy was presented the senior managers were given the chance to vote anonymously on whether or not they supported it the result was clearcut  voted in support “as soon as i saw the result i knew we were on the way to getting where we needed to go” says gorman for the past three years those watching morgan stanley closely would have noticed a change even if the groupwide return on equity numbers remained steadfastly disappointing in the midsingle digits the wealth management division benefitted hugely from the merger with smith barney to become a clear leader in the us capital markets and financing divisions began to fire and were no longer the poor relation of the advisory arm kelleher took a firm grip of the ficc division and remorselessly reduced it to a much more manageable size for the current regulatory environment – from  billion of revenues or  of the business in  to a little over  billion in  or just  of firmwide revenues and perhaps most remarkably of all given the history of the firm the investment bankers started not just to see but to tout the benefits of the wealth management arm to both the overall firm and to their own side of the business much of that flows down from the top management team the three senior leaders of the business – gorman kelleher and president of wealth management greg fleming – clearly get on well there’s a great deal of mutual respect each has had a long varied and successful career these are not banking automatons all three are quite likely to take the conversation off on a tangent and talk about something completely different but when they are on message they are sharp as tacks and straight to the point – and often thoughtprovoking toowhen both fleming and kelleher say words to the effect of “you don’t get the warm and cuddly with james” it’s done with a smile and great deal of warmth and respectthe trio breakfast together regularly – just them no advisers here they formulate the key strategic decisions for the firm and make sure their businesses stay focused on working better togethergorman may have a reputation as a cold fish but he’s enormously engaging to interview leaping from his conference table to his desk to get the details to back up his claims leaning forward to make a point raising his arms in a mock celebration of victory when he bats back a criticism from euromoney even inviting your correspondent to a putting competition on the way out of his office he losthe certainly inspires loyalty from those closest to him kelleher says “james is a strategic thinker and a collaborative leader who builds cohesive teams he selects people carefully and then empowers them without micromanaging we decide together on strategy but he leaves me to get on with the execution”fleming who is perhaps the only senior banker to have left merrill lynch after being there through the financial crisis with his reputation intact and arguably enhanced tells a similar story “when we have differences of opinion we’ll talk it through if we still don’t agree he’ll often say ‘ok it’s your business it’s your call’ there’s a huge amount of respect in the relationship”now morgan stanley is starting to earn respect from the market its share price is up  over the past year slightly outperforming goldman sachs and well ahead of jpmorgan’s  rise in that time more than that the first quarter of  might be the turning point that shows the new morgan stanley is proving gorman’s model works james gorman we made some tough decisions to get to this pointreturn on equity broke into double digits for the first time since  at  net revenues were  billion up from  billion in the first quarter of  wealth management hit gorman’s pretax margin target of  the dividend was increased by  and just as important was the balance of the business net revenues in kelleher’s investment bank known as the institutional securities group were  billion within that division advisory revenues were  million equity sales and trading were  billion and in ficc they were  billion combined net revenues in fleming’s wealth and investment management business were  billion gorman is not declaring victory yet he knows one good quarter is far from enough he also knows that numbers for the fourth quarter of  were a huge disappointment after a good start to that year depressing fullyear roe to  largely because of a very poor quarter in ficcbut he is claiming at least vindication of his strategy “we made some tough decisions to get to this point” says gorman “and it’s great for everyone who stuck with us – whether it’s our employees our shareholders or our clients – to be in this position”when moodys downgraded morgan stanley to tripleb in  it’s argument went something like this one morgan stanley’s earnings were not covering its cost of capital two management would come under increasing pressure to do so three gorman and his colleagues would be forced to increase risk to get those earnings up four whenever morgan stanley tried to increase its risk profile in the past it screwed up five further down the line that riskinduced screwup would hit earningsmorgan stanley insiders admit all those arguments were fine except the most crucial one in moody’s hypothesis the firm did not increase risk as morgan stanley’s rebalancing took root gorman quietly fumed that moody’s would not budge on the tripleb rating the problem of course was that earnings were still not covering the cost of capitalin the first quarter of  came the numbers that allowed morgan stanley to thumb its nose at moody’s underlying return on equity at normalised tax rates came in at  this was achieved with falling value at risk and a decline in riskweighted assets “the numbers speak for themselves” says gormanthose numbers also spoke to moody’s and gorman won’t be drawn on whether he made a call to the rating agency to point out the first quarter numbers or that fault in their  hypothesis in may morgan stanley was upgraded two notches from baa to a it was an important moment for a number of reasons – and in particular the underpressure ficc businessbefore  morgan stanley’s share of global ficc revenues was generally around  of the market after the moody’s downgrade lost the firm its singlearated status it lost a lot of business – about  of market share in a  billionayear revenue industry that’s a loss of more than  billion of revenues the business leaves quickly after a downgrade and takes a lot longer to come back – if it ever will given the cuts morgan stanley has made to the division but for the first time in a long time there is tailwind in the firm’s most challenged area gorman says the first quarter doubledigit return on equity is sustainable in the mediumtolong term although with macro uncertainties he can’t say it can be repeated quarteronquarter this year but he points out that morgan stanley’s roe has been on a sustainable rise up around two percentage points a year for the past three years he expects that to continue in the years to come that puts a steady if far from spectacular roe of  within touching distance how gorman points to three factors first there’s the global macro recovery by far the biggest of morgan stanley’s exposures with its huge retail brokerage arm is to the improving us economy it is also a play on a recovering japan where the firm’s securities and brokerage joint ventures with shareholder mufg are confounding sceptics and challenging incumbents such as nomura domestically while other international banks decide whether or not to try to build up againsecond there’s the competitive environment while european banks such as barclays credit suisse and deutsche bank consider how to shrink their balance sheets and probably contract their markets businesses morgan stanley has been through that process already in the third quarter of  the firm had around  billion of riskweighted assets in its fixed income division today that number is closer to  billionyes its ficc revenues have suffered in the meantime but they’re picking up again in the first quarter helped by a return of volatility that boosted all firms ficc revenues jumped to  billion compared with just  million in the fourth quarter of  “the first quarter was a proof of concept for us in ficc and as a firm – showing that in favourable market conditions without increasing the balance sheet fixed income can be a meaningful contributor that leads to a firmwide return on equity of better than ” says gormanindeed after the moody’s upgrade a number of clients were quickly on the phone to gorman – among them some of the world’s biggest fund managers – inviting morgan stanley to reopen lines with them one even sent pizza to the entire ficc trading floor as a ‘lets do business together again’ gesture and it hasn’t escaped the notice of morgan stanley bankers that one of the firms they hope to win ficc business from – deutsche bank now by far the biggest of the european houses – suffered a downgrade to tripleb status from standard  poor’s in june the very downgrade that cost morgan stanley market share three years ago a corner has been turned “we’re not a morgan stanley ficc story anymore as we were for a number of years now we’re part of the overall ficc challenge story” says kelleherit’s also a business that is starting to attract talent again kelleher points to the recent hire of kay haigh as global head of emerging markets as an example haigh was a former head of emerging markets trading at deutsche bank “throughout the crisis we were able to hire top people in ma and equities now we’re increasingly able to do it in ficc and capital markets” says kelleherbut don’t mistake this enthusiasm for ficc with a desire to chase the firm back to the top of the ficc rankings “in all our other business lines we aspire to be at least a topthree player we have no aspiration to be back in the top three in ficc that is not our model” gorman says firmly “we want to make the best return we can on the capital and resources we are comfortable to commit”third there’s what gorman describes as the “idiosyncratic” nature of the newlook morgan stanley some say with the combination of investment banking and wealth management he has tried to recreate the old merrill lynch where he worked until gorman doesn’t see it that way the day before euromoney visits him in midjune morgan stanley has just taken receipt of the final deposits it acquired with the purchase of the smith barney brokerage from citi “we have a  billion deposit base which would make us the th largest bank in the us” says gorman “the opportunity to grow that bank through prudent lending to our clients is incredible” that deposit base already puts morgan stanley on a par with a us consumer bank such as bbt which has a market capitalization of around  billion is that sort of value realized in morgan stanley’s stock price and with the fed likely to start raising interest rates soon the firm is set to benefit from a natural uptick in revenues “we’re not a morgan stanley ficc story anymore as we were for a number of years now we’re part of the overall ficc challenge story  colm kelleherpeople who know gorman well say that as an exmckinsey consultant and atheart wealth manager he struggles to get comfortable with the profit and loss volatility that a business exposed to market fluctuations must endure gorman sees it all from a holistic point of view “the investment bank is fantastic and remarkably resilient so is our equities business which is the best in the world in asset management we’re not worried about size but we do care about revenues and returns and we’re doing well there and the wealth management business is the railroad on which we can drive the whole firm forward”as for that volatile markets business gorman says “look at our fourth quarter and first quarter numbers we can generate good returns for the firm off ficc revenues of  million as we did in the fourth quarter in a good quarter like the first we can earn considerably more than that – revenues of  billion to be exact so we have a business which is roughly  of the whole firm where with the right market conditions there is significant upside potential i am quite comfortable with that position”and what of the client business within the investment bank which remains the most highprofile indicator of the health of the firm morgan stanley continues to occupy its seemingly immovable topthree position in equity capital markets and ma although it has one big gap in particular to close on archrival goldman sachs as you’d expect it advised on five of the biggest completed global ma deals of the last year it is now actively advising on the two biggest deals currently in the market the  billion royal dutch shellbg takeover and the  billion chartertime warner deal its equity capital markets team has been on a large proportion of key deals such as the citizens ipo and of course the landmark alibaba listing but morgan stanley is also showing up in places you might not expectgorman says the advisory businesses are much more joined up with capital markets these days and credits kelleher – who became sole president of isg after taubman left in  to set up his own advisory firm – for making them such “the fact that colm has a trading and capital markets background has really helped to bring the two areas together we’re now much better at bringing the whole firm to our clients this is a leaner more focused place”a great example of this is its work for pharmaceuticals group abbvie completed in may this year abbvie bought leading oncology firm pharmacyclics for  billion morgan stanley was not just the key adviser to abbvie in march to ensure that abbvie was in the best position possible amid a highly competitive ma process for pharmacyclics it arranged a full  billion day bridge commitment within a matter of days it’s the biggest committed financing of the year so far – not something you would always have associated morgan stanley withnot only that it was a clear incidence of the joint venture with mufg working morgan stanley provided  billion of the commitment while its japanese partner stumped up the remaining  billionafter winning the ma bid morgan stanley quickly followed up on may  as lead left bookrunner on a  billion bond deal for abbvie the deal generated  billion in ordersjust one day after that morgan stanley was one of the bookrunners on a  billion bond offering across five tranches for shell in the us market the second biggest yankee bond of all time morgan stanley is getting better across debt markets another growing business is its leveraged finance franchise it’s run by dan toscano a veteran leveraged financier who had previously worked for bankers trust and deutsche banktoscano had come close to joining morgan stanley before but both times in the late s and mids he backed away from the opportunity feeling that senior management did not really understand the acquisition finance business and were getting into it not so much because they wanted to but because they felt they had to so when morgan stanley came calling again in  when toscano was taking a break from the markets he went to  broadway for a third time but not before telling his wife to expect him home pretty soon – he didn’t foresee the opportunity being any more appealing on this occasion and anticipated a swift and unsuccessful meeting he’s now been at the firm for five years “it was clear that morgan stanley had finally connected the dots event finance completed the circle around its great advisory and equity capital markets businesses now we have a globally integrated finance platform”over the last  months the bank has done more leveraged finance business than ever before this included a  billion bond offering for dynegy last october the biggest us highyield financing in  and a  morgan stanleyunderwritten  billion financing for longterm client zebra technologies for its acquisition of motorola solutions’ enterpriseour financial advisers and their clients are now getting full access to products and ideas that used to just rest in the institutional side of the business that benefits the whole firmgreg flemingmorgan stanleyits not just the disparate arms of the institutional securities group that are better aligned fleming says he and kelleher are working to bring the wealth and investment banking parts of the business closer together this includes getting top investment bankers to forge closer relationships with the best brokers that didn’t happen in the dean witter days for example “we’ve got great tech investment bankers we also manage a lot of money for tech entrepreneurs managed by some of our toprated financial advisers these guys are getting to know each other they respect each other and they are seeing the benefits of working together” says fleming the comingtogether also involves some important people moves between the businesses in march morgan stanley veteran raj dhanda who had run the equities and capital markets businesses in the institutional securities group for a number of years moved across to the wealth side there he’s in charge of all products and services for wealth the executive dhanda replaced as head of investment products andy saperstein a former colleague of gorman’s at merrill lynch has moved across to become chief operating officer of isg elizabeth dennis a year veteran of the capital markets group and former debt syndicate staffer has since june been in charge of selling all bonds and equities through the retail network “our financial advisers and their clients are now getting full access to products and ideas that used to just rest in the institutional side of the business” says fleming “that benefits the whole firm”to put that benefit into context gorman estimates that around  of the firm’s wealth clients on average are looking to do a deal on any given day on a  trillion asset base that’s about  billion a day of product that the securities group can service morgan stanley ecm bankers get particularly excited at that prospect and the japanese joint venture is doing better than anyone expected from tokyo to new york and all financial centres inbetween morgan stanley bankers are delighted with their relationship with japan’s mufg which took a  stake in the business in more important today perhaps is the way the two banks are working together first there’s the securities joint venture in japan gorman is incredibly bullish about its prospects “it’s helped make us clearly the number one foreign firm in japan” he says whisper it quietly but morgan stanley has bigger targets in its sights and wants its securities jv in japan to be the clear challenger to longterm incumbent nomurato be frank it took a while for some people internally to grasp what we were doing you have to start delivering consistent results and show the benefit of the strategy before investors will give you credit for itjames gorman morgan stanleythere’s also a  stake in a joint venture with mufg targeting wealthy retail customers gorman says the distribution power within that business has huge potential for the whole firm then there are lending agreements in japan asia and the us where mufg’s balance sheet can work alongside morgan stanley to provide financing to clients such as the abbvie bridge financing all this leads to the question could morgan stanley and mufg do more together any kind of fullscale merger is certainly not on the agenda mufg’s leaders must be delighted with their investment the stake which they bought for  billion in  is now worth  billion notwithstanding the revenues the ventures are making but morgan stanley insiders say they have to tread a careful line – too much crossparticipation might not pass fed scrutiny and could lead to concerns about potential control issues back to where we started gorman’s handwritten rituals there’s another this one annual rather than daily at the start of each year he writes down  key targets for the  months aheadone target is there on each of the six sheets he has produced as ceo it reads simply ‘no new mistakes’ gorman defines a mistake as something that would cost the firm  of its capital – in  terms around  million so far on every new year’s eve he’s ticked that one off on average he’s managed to meet around seven or eight of the targets he has set the firm and himself annually that’s no mean feat given the market industry and regulatory uncertainties that have faced morgan stanley over the past five years and don’t be fooled into thinking gorman gives himself an easy ride the targets are not for public consumption these are the milestones a competitive driven australian sets for himself many of the targets are easy to define successes in  included instituting the dividend and buyback policy  up and  billion over five quarters after passing the comprehensive capital analysis and review test and selling the firm’s physical oil unit a near miss was the  margin target in the wealth business but this was achieved in the first quarter of  others are less tangible in  for example gorman wanted to “reenergise the senior leadership team” in  he wanted the firm to “behave like winners” last year his aim was to ensure a “meaningful shift in culture” at the firm further readingbest global investment bank  morgan stanleyone thing gorman doesn’t put on his top  list are firmwide roe targets like all big financial institutions morgan stanley has a lot more equity now than it did before in  it was about  billion today it’s  billion the firm’s buyback policy and dividend ratio is now much closer to the capital it is accreting and gorman says the cost of equity is going down the key is to consistently grow the returns and that should get the share price – which was  in  and is around  now – moving higher as well the price to tangible book value is around  times – slightly ahead of goldman’s at  times but the target is another bank that like morgan stanley has rebalanced its business towards wealth management ubs which trades at around  times bookand gorman has put his money where his mouth is since he became ceo he has not sold a single penny of his near  million of morgan stanley stock indeed he’s one of very few us bank chiefs who have invested in his firm’s stock from his own account to get more people buying the stock investors need to understand the nature of the new morgan stanley gorman admits to some frustration in the past on this front “with hindsight i was wrong to expect investors to understand it earlier to be frank it took a while for some people internally to grasp what we were doing you have to start delivering consistent results and show the benefit of the strategy before investors will give you credit for it”now gorman’s message is clear and easy to understand “we have the ballast of wealth management and retail and the engine of the investment bank our bet is that the market will like that combination our book is rock solid there’s no reason why if we continue to deliver investors should not apply a premium to it”i knew if we had  brokers with  trillion in assets then we would always have the foundation of a stable businessthe deal that made morgan stanleys james gorman further reading on euromoney awards

with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome
