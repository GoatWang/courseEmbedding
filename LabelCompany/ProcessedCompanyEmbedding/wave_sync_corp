when ccb started testing internally the audio bank cards embedded with our flexible circuit board with the audio chips upon a consistent positive response from the market and relying on the success of this pilot program we may seek to further develop relationships with other card issuers including banks such as china industrial and commercial bank bank of china agricultural bank of china and bank of communications issuance of audio bank cards by these card issuers and large banks may in turn encourage other smaller banks and card issuers in china to work with us and market our products to their customers in addition we are exploring codevelopment opportunities with nonbank businesses on august   we entered into a strategic agreement with qilong to jointly develop the next generation of audio bank cards within the china union pay network we hope that we can leverage qilong’s customer base to market the next generation of our audio bank cards            pricing   at present there are no similar products on the market taking into account the level of acceptance by the market and the negotiation with issuing banks we suggest that the unit price of the audio bank cards with our inlays to be set at per unit rmb  approximately  and inlay audio chips at per unit rmb  approximately  price will be adjusted downwards upon the increase of volume issued and the amounts of competitive offers   research and development   pursuant to the partnership agreement between shenzhen excecard and uint for the period from may   to april   shenzhen excecard paid uint € for rd

our second generation audio bank cards with one chip of a combined function of audio chip and financial chip and third generation audio bank cards with fingerprint sensor chips and other personalized functions   seasonality   we do not expect our operating results and operating cash flows to be subject to seasonal variations   employees   a substantial part of our employees are located in china as of the date of this annual report guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have  employees in china and  employees are located in the us there are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory   we are required to contribute a portion of our employees’ total salaries to the chinese government’s social insurance funds including medical insurance unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation insurance and a housing assistance fund in accordance with relevant regulations guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are currently paying social insurance for all of their twenty  fulltime employees through a third party agent we expect the amount of contribution to the government’s social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations   insurance companies in china offer limited business insurance products while business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in china we have determined that the risks of interruption cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance as a result we could face liability from the interruption of our business   intellectual property   currently we have five valid patents that were granted by the state intellectual property office of the prc “sipo” and the terms of which are ten years from the dates of grant of the patent applications the five patents relate to the audio bank card technology and designs and its transaction system such as the design of the circuit board embedded in the audio card the transaction platform processing the audio data and the design of the audio chip two of the five patents were granted on may   and the rest were granted respectively on january   september   and december   we obtained one trademark of the company’s logo from sipo on august   which remains valid until august   in addition we have two other pending trademark applications in prc on april   the company through one of its subsidiaries obtained the copyright on its software of zhuozhi changtian bank audio card application for micro and small businesses            pursuant to the partnership agreement any background information and knowhow used in connection with the agreement remain the property of the party introducing such background information uint’s knowhow relating to the services it provides under this agreement remains the exclusive property of uint and it may use such knowhow for other clients additionally the costs and rights of any patent related to the new audio bank card product arises during the term are borne by and shared equally by both parties   government approval and regulation   we believe that we have been compliant to date with all requirements required by the applicable governing authorities in china for the research development production and distribution of audio bank cards embedded with our inlays and that such laws rules and regulations do not currently have a material impact on our operations however it is possible that more stringent rules or regulations could be adopted which may increase our operating costs and expenses   additionally since  the pboc has issued several versions of financial ic card specifications on november   pboc published a notice on further application of financial ic card proposing a time frame ie from april   new financial ic cards issued by any issuing banks should comply with the pboc financial ic card specifications version  we believe that we are in compliance with these requirements by the pboc   competition   we currently are not aware of any other companies in or outside of china which is producing or marketing the similar products as our audio bank cards   however upon the introduction of our products and technology into the market our potential competitors worldwide may include nagraid security sa a switzerlandbased technology and security services supplier for governments enterprises the banking industry and online electronic transactions smartplayer technology co ltd a taiwanbased developer of viable display module for smart card applications suzhou hierstar system limited a prcbased company that focuses on display cards embedded with onetime password otp and public key infrastructure pki technologies and uint   going concern   as reflected in the accompanying financial statements as of december   the company had accumulated deficits of  and working capital deficit of current liabilities exceeding current assets by  due to the substantial losses in operation in previous periods management’s plan to support the company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation if we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings we will have to find alternative sources such as loans or advances from our officers directors or others such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term even if the company is able to obtain additional financing it may contain undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in the case of equity financing if we require additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern            item a risk factors   our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks some of these risks are described below and you should take these risks into account in making a decision to invest in our common stock if any of the following risks actually occurs we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed in that case the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock   risks related to the business and operations of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries   risks related to the overall business of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate their financial position and future success   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have had a limited prior operating history by which to evaluate the likelihood of success or their ability to continue as a going concern although guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have been developing technology for and producing inlays for audio bank cards and are participating in a pilot program with ccb guangdong there is no assurance our production capacity and sales will keep increasing in a profitable manner   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries heavily depend on sales of one key product namely inlays for audio bank cards   since the beginning of  guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries began generating revenue from the sales of inlays for audio bank cards and are expected to derive a significant portion of their future revenue from such sales   audio bank cards embedded with our inlays are sold in the people’s republic of china as a new generation of bank cards seeking to substitute the traditional magnetic stripe bank cards because we have a very limited sales history of the inlays of our bank audio cards it is difficult for us to estimate the market and sales of our products demand for audio bank cards may not meet our expectation if audio bank cards do not gain broad market acceptance and build consumer confidence in their quality security and availability or if the technology in audio bank cards is replaced by a more innovative alternate our prospects will be negatively impacted   the results of operations financial position and business outlook of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries will be highly dependent on the market’s response   although the audio bank card meets the international standards such as those established by mastercard for active smart bank cards and the innovative product standards set forth by unionpay ccb will only be testing the market’s response in guangdong province china with the first  cards in addition bank cards with ic chips have just been popularized in china since january   the market may not respond immediately to another new bank card technology further the market may perceive the traditional cash payment method or the cardless payment method eg mobile wallet to be more convenient or secured if the market does not respond to the product as quickly or does not accept the product as widely as expected the results of operations financial position and business outlook of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries will be negatively affected   the results of operations financial position and business outlook of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries will be highly dependent on shenzhen excecard being and remaining the exclusive distributor of audio chips and audio bank card products in the greater china area   according to the partnership agreement with uint shenzhen excecard will be the exclusive distributor in the greater china area for five years from the date on which the first audio bank card is officially deployed by any commercial banks in china and to keep its exclusivity status shenzhen execcard has to order  million audio card products from uint annually in the event that shenzhen excecard does not meet this annual quota it will lose its status of exclusive distributor in the greater china area which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and business outlook            egoos bvi is a holding company and there are significant limitations on its ability to receive distributions from its subsidiaries   egoos bvi conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries and through contractual arrangements with guangzhou yuzhi an affiliated variable interest entity “vie” and guangzhou yuzhi’s subsidiaries shenzhen excecard and guangzhou rongsheng and is dependent on dividends and other intercompany transfers of funds from its subsidiaries and affiliated vie to meet its financial obligations egoos bvi’s subsidiaries have not made significant distributions to it and may not have funds legally available for dividends or distributions in the future in addition egoos bvi may enter into credit or other agreements that would contractually restrict its subsidiaries or affiliated vie from paying dividends or making distributions any inability of egoos bvi to receive funds from its subsidiaries including guangzhou yuzhi can be expected to impair its ability to pay dividends on the common stock and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our future operating or growth prospects   the research and development of audio chipinlay is entirely dependent on the partnership relationship between guangzhou yuzhi and uint   shenzhen excecard engaged uint pursuant to the partnership agreement with a term from may   to april   to research and develop audio bank card technology although guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries intend to continue to cooperate with uint and to eventually acquire uint there is no assurance that the merger transaction will be consummated or that uint will continue to develop any audio bank card technology for guangzhou yuzhi in addition pursuant to the partnership agreement the knowhow relating to the services provided by uint will remain the exclusive property of uint and uint may use such knowhow for its other clients competitors of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries may engage uint to develop new technology and potentially compete with the audio bank card product of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries any such incidents may harm the financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries   we depend on thirdparty suppliers for the manufacturing of a substantial portion of our products which subjects the company to risks including unanticipated increases in expenses decreases in revenues and disruptions in the supply chain   we are dependent on smartdisplayer” a thirdparty supplier for the manufacturing of all bank audio cards as of the date of this report currently we rely on the testing workshop in shenzhen china and the operations of uint in limoges france to manufacture inlays a type of key components of our audio bank cards we only have commercial contracts with uint and smartdisplayer our ability to select reliable suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products will impact our success in meeting customer demand any inability of our suppliers to timely deliver products that meet our specifications or any unanticipated changes in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the company   shenzhen excecard leases the workshop from shenzhen tianshi qiancheng co ltd “shenzhen tianshi qiancheng” to manufacture the inlays on a small scale and owns the furniture equipment and relating properties in the workshop we anticipate that our manufacturing capacity might be negatively affected or disrupted if the lease agreement with shenzhen tianshi qiancheng is terminated unexpectedly and a new lease for a similar space with appropriate accommodations at a reasonable price is not available in a timely manner or at all   a significant portion of egoos bvi’s revenues are derived from the sale of inlays for audio bank cards the manufacture of some of which is in limoges france although the company and its subsidiaries plan to expand the testing workshop to a fullservice factory in china in the near future we cannot assure that we will be successful on constructing such a factory to produce the inlays or the bank audio cards in a timely and costefficient manner   manufacturing operations both domestic and international are subject to inherent risks all of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations risks affecting operations include     ● unexpected changes in regulatory requirements     ● political and economic instability              ● terrorism and civil unrest     ● equipment and machinery breakdowns     ● injuries or accidents at our facilities     ● severe weather or other natural disasters     ● work stoppages or strikes         ● currency fluctuations         ● difficulties in staffing and managing operations and     ● variations in tariffs quotas taxes and other market barriers   some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damages and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties any such delay or disruption can be expected to harm egoos bvi’s financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have not entered into and may not be able to enter into any enforceable agreement with ccb in connection with the pilot program in which ccb will distribute  of audio bank cards with our inlays   although guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have negotiated with ccb and have obtained an oral agreement from ccb guangdong for ccb to issue  audio bank cards with our inlays through its guangdong branches and ccb has started an internal testing since march  in the event that ccb partially or completely fails to implement the rest of the pilot program such oral agreement is not enforceable against ccb or ccb guangdong moreover there is no assurance that an enforceable agreement in writing between ccb and guangzhou yuzhi or its subsidiaries will be entered into regarding this pilot program our future operating results and financial condition could be significantly disrupted if the pilot program is not implemented as planned   in the near future the distribution of audio bank cards embedded with our inlays may be entirely dependent on one pilot program of the guangdong branches of ccb in china   in the near future ccb may remain the only distributor of the audio bank cards with our inlays in china in the event that the ccb’s pilot program in guangdong province china fails to gain positive market response as expected ccb may elect to discontinue the distribution of audio bank card products although guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are actively developing relationships with other potential issuers and other major banks in china for the distribution of the audio bank cards with our inlays there is no assurance such efforts will be successful or will result in steady income cash flow for the company therefore the financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects may be materially negatively affected in the event that ccb discontinues the distribution of the audio bank cards with our inlays   currently our revenues are primarily dependent on two customers that are engaged in the mass production of audio bank cards   we cooperate with our two customers hengbao and tianyu based on cooperation agreements with each of them and there is no assurance that these agreements will not be terminated earlier and guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries may not be able to secure orders from other card manufacturers any such incidents may harm the financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries            gross margins are principally dependent on the spread between development and production cost and sale price if the cost of development and production increases and sale price does not increase or if the sale price decreases and the cost of development and production does not decrease gross margins will decrease and egoos bvi’s results of operations could be harmed should the sales volume of the product does not increase   egoos bvi’s gross margins depend principally on the spread between development and production cost and sale price   while moving the production from france to china could potentially decrease the cost of production the sale price of audio chipsinlays may decrease as well as potential competitors start developing and producing like products which may narrow the gross margins should the sales volume does not increase any event that tends to negatively impact the sales volume of audio chips of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries will potentially harm its financial condition and results of operation   consumer acceptance or rejection of audio bank cards will have a material impact on egoos bvi’s future prospects   the market in china for audio bank cards has not developed therefore widespread acceptance of audio bank cards is not assured and depends on market acceptance of audio bank cards as an addition or an alternative to traditional bank cards or other channels to bank or make payment because this market is new it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate in addition a longterm customer base has not been adequately defined the success of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries in generating revenue in this emerging market will depend among other things on its ability to educate potential customers and endusers about the practical benefits of audio bank cards in the event a substantial market for audio bank cards fails to materialize or if we fail to properly capitalize on such market our growth and future operating prospects will be materially harmed   unanticipated problems or delays with product quality or product performance could result in a decrease in customers and revenue unexpected expenses and loss of market share   egoos bvi’s cash flow depends on the timely and economical operations of and its partnership with the rd and production centers in france and potentially other production facilities in china   the development and production of audio chips are complex and the audio chips must meet detailed quality requirements in order to ensure the safety and efficiency of use concerns about audio chips quality may impact the ability of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries to successfully market their audio chips and audio bank cards embedded with our inlays to a larger market if the product does not meet its promised and marketed quality standards its credibility and the market acceptance and sales volume could be negatively affected in addition actual or perceived problems with protection of user’s information in the industry generally may lead to a lack of consumer confidence in bank cards encrypted with chips of new technology prolonged problems may threaten the commercial viability of audio bank cards generally or the production and sale of the product specifically   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries plan to primarily sell their audio chipsinlays and relevant technology to card manufacturers which are expected to sell audio bank cards through banks in china and if their relationships with one or more of these card manufacturers or banks were to end their operating results could be harmed   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are expected to market and distribute a substantial portion of its audio chipsinlays and relevant technology to card manufacturers which are expected to sell audio bank cards through major banks in china their future operating results and financial condition could be significantly disrupted by the loss of one or more of these card manufacturers or banks with current or future relationships order cancellations or the failure of the card manufacturers or banks to successfully sell the products            financial instability in the chinese financial markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   the chinese financial markets and the chinese economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries including other asian emerging countries and the united states financial turmoil in asia russia and elsewhere in the world in recent years has affected the chinese economy although economic conditions are different in each country investors’ reactions to developments in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies operating in other countries including china a loss in investor confidence in the financial systems of other countries may cause increased volatility in chinese financial markets and indirectly in the chinese economy in general financial disruptions could harm guangzhou yuzhi’s operation or its stock price results of operations and financial condition   natural calamities could have a negative impact on the chinese economy and harm the business of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries   china has experienced natural calamities such as earthquakes floods droughts and a tsunami in recent years the extent and severity of these natural disasters determines their impact on the economies in the local communities that experience these calamities natural disasters could have an adverse impact on the economies in the geographic regions in which guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries operate which could adversely affect their operating and growth prospects   growth may impose a significant burden on the administrative and operational resources of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries which if not effectively managed could impair their growth   the strategy of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries envisions a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on their administrative and operational resources the growth of their business will require significant investments of capital and management’s close attention their ability to effectively manage their growth will require them to substantially expand the capabilities of their administrative and operational resources and to attract train manage and retain qualified management technicians and other personnel failure to successfully manage their growth could result in their sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments if guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully manage their growth they may be unable to achieve their growth goals   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries may be unable to protect their intellectual property which could negatively affect its ability to compete   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries rely on a combination of patent registered trademark confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect their intellectual property rights they also enter into confidentiality agreements with their employees consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of their confidential information these measures may not preclude the disclosure of their confidential or proprietary information despite efforts to protect their proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use their proprietary technologies and information monitoring unauthorized use of confidential information is difficult and guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries cannot be certain that the steps they takes to prevent unauthorized use of its proprietary technologies and confidential information particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the us will be effective failure to protect our intellectual property rights can be expected to have a material adverse impact on our competitive advantage and potentially on our financial condition stock price and future growth prospects   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries will be required to hire and retain skilled technical and managerial personnel   personnel qualified to continue researching and developing and to operate and manage production center and other facilities are in demand the success of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries depends in large part on their ability to attract train motivate and retain qualified management and highlyskilled employees particularly managerial technical sales and marketing personnel technicians and other critical personnel any failure to attract and retain such personnel may have a negative impact on the operations of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries which would have a negative impact on revenues            guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are dependent upon their officers and directors for management and direction and the loss of any of these persons could adversely affect their operations and results   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are dependent upon their officers and directors for implementation and execution of their business plan the loss of any of their officers or directors could have a material adverse effect upon their results of operations and financial position guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries do not maintain “key person” life insurance for any of their officers the loss of any of their officers or directors could delay or prevent the achievement of their business objectives   egoos bvi’s lack of business diversification could result in the devaluation of its securities if it does not generate revenue from its primary products or such revenues decrease   the current business of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries consists solely of the research and development production and sale of audio chips in china currently sales of the products account for almost  of egoos bvi’s revenues the lack of business diversification could cause you to lose all or some of your investment since egoos bvi does not have any other lines of business or alternative revenue sources   failure to fully comply with prc labor laws including laws relating to social insurance may expose guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries to potential liability and increased costs   companies operating in china must comply with a variety of labor laws including certain pension health insurance unemployment insurance and other welfareoriented payment obligations guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are currently paying social insurance for all of their twenty fulltime employees through a third party agent if the prc regulatory authorities take the view that payment of social insurance through a third party agent is invalid the failure to comply may be in violation of applicable prc labor laws and we cannot assure you that prc governmental authorities will not impose penalties on guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries therefor which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries   in addition the new prc labor contract law took effect january   and governs standard terms and conditions for employment including termination and layoff rights contract requirements compensation levels and consultation with labor unions among other topics in addition the law limits noncompetition agreements with senior management and other employees who have access to confidential information to two years and imposes restrictions or geographical limits this new labor contract law will increase the labor costs of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries which could adversely impact the results of operations   egoos bvi may have difficulty establishing adequate management governance legal and financial controls in the prc   the prc historically has been deficient in western style management governance and financial reporting concepts and practices as well as in modern banking and other control systems our current management has little experience with western style management governance and financial reporting concepts and practices and we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the prc as a result of these factors and especially given that we expect to be a publicly listed company in the us and subject to regulation as such we may experience difficulty in establishing management governance legal and financial controls collecting financial data and preparing financial statements books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet western standards we may have difficulty establishing adequate management governance legal and financial controls in the prc therefore we may in turn experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under applicable us laws rules and regulations this may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with sec rules and regulations any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our business and the public announcement of such deficiencies could adversely impact our stock price            the company has not yet developed comprehensive independent corporate governance   although the company has formed audit compensation and nominating committees of its board of directors it is inexperienced in formal us corporate governance procedures a lack of functioning independent controls over the company’s corporate affairs may result in potential or actual conflicts of interest between controlling shareholders and other shareholders it presently has no policy to resolve such conflicts the absence of customary standards of corporate governance may leave its shareholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest if any and similar matters and any potential investors may be reluctant to provide the company with funds necessary to expand its operations   although our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis we must raise additional capital to fund our operations in order to continue as a going concern   wwc pc our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended december   and  has included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings we will have to find alternative sources such as loans or advances from our officers directors or others such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term even if the company is able to obtain additional financing it may contain undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in the case of equity financing if we require additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment   risks related to the vie agreements   the prc government may determine that the vie agreements are not in compliance with applicable prc laws rules and regulations   egoos bvi manages and operates the business of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries through yigou pursuant to the rights it holds under the vie agreements almost all economic benefits and risks arising from the operations of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are transferred to egoos bvi under these agreements   there are risks involved with the operation of the business of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries in reliance on the vie agreements including the risk that the vie agreements may be determined by prc regulators or courts to be unenforceable if the vie agreements were for any reason determined to be in breach of any existing or future prc laws or regulations the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such breach including     ● imposing economic penalties     ● discontinuing or restricting the operations of yigou or guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries     ● imposing conditions or requirements in respect of the vie agreements with which the group may not be able to comply     ● requiring egoos bvi to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations     ● taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could adversely affect its business and     ● revoking the business licenses or certificates of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries andor voiding the vie agreements   any of these actions could adversely affect egoos bvi’s ability to manage operate and gain the financial benefits of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries which represents its sole operations which would have a material adverse impact on its business financial condition and results of operations            egoos bvi’s ability to manage and operate guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries under the vie agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership   egoos bvi’s plans for future growth are based substantially on growing the operations of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries however the vie agreements may not be as effective in providing egoos bvi with control over guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries as direct ownership under the current vie arrangements as a legal matter if guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries fail to perform their obligations egoos bvi may have to i incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements and ii rely on legal remedies under prc law which it cannot be sure would be effective therefore if egoos bvi is unable to effectively control guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries it may have an adverse effect on its ability to achieve its business objectives and grow its revenues   risks related to doing business in the prc   the chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries must conduct their business activities   guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are dependent on its relationship with the local government in guangdong province where they operate the chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership the ability of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries to operate in china may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations including those relating to taxation environmental regulations land use rights property and other matters the central or local governments of the prc may impose new stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries’ part to ensure compliance with such regulations or interpretations accordingly government actions in the future including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies could have a significant effect on economic conditions in china or particular regions thereof and could require egoos bvi to divest itself of any interest it then holds in chinese properties   future inflation in china may inhibit the ability of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries to conduct business in china in recent years the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation if prices for the products of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries rise at a rate or unchanged or even decrease so that they are insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of development and production it may have an adverse effect on profitability these factors have led to the adoption by the chinese government from time to time of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation high inflation may in the future cause chinese government to impose controls on credit andor prices or to take other action which could inhibit economic activity in china and thereby harm the market for audio chips and audio bank cards products   the operations and assets of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries in china are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and egoos bvi may lose all of their assets and operations if the chinese government alters its policies to further restrict foreign participation in business operating in the prc   changes in prc laws and regulations or their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation restrictions on currency conversion imports and sources of supply devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of under its current leadership the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activities and greater economic decentralization there is no assurance however that the chinese government will continue to pursue these policies or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice egoos bvi may lose all of its assets and operations if the chinese government alters its policies to further restrict foreign participation in business operating in the prc             egoos bvi derives all of its sales in china and a slowdown or other adverse development in the prc economy may materially and adversely affect the customers and endusers of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries demand for their products and their business   all of the sales of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are generated in china and they anticipates that sales of their audio bank cards and audio chips in china will continue to represent all of their total sales in the near future although the prc economy has grown significantly in recent years no assurances can be given that such growth will continue the industry in which guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries is involved in the prc is new and growing but guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries do not know how sensitive this industry is to a slowdown in economic growth or other adverse changes in the prc economy which may affect demand for audio chips and audio bank cards products in addition the chinese government also exercises significant control over chinese economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies efforts by the chinese government to slow the pace of growth of the chinese economy could result in reduced demand for biodiesel products a slowdown in overall economic growth an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the prc may materially reduce the demand for bank cards in general or audio bank cards in particular and materially and adversely affect the business results of operations and future operating prospects of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries   currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect the business of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries including limiting the ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and if chinese renminbi were to decline in value reducing egoos bvi’s financial results in us dollar terms   egoos bvi’s reporting currency is the us dollar and the operations of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries in china use china’s local currency as their functional currency substantially all of egoos bvi’s revenues and expenses are in the chinese currency the renminbi or rmb egoos bvi is subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to both of these currencies for example the value of the renminbi depends to a large extent on chinese government policies and china’s domestic and international economic and political developments as well as supply and demand in the local market since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of the renminbi to the us dollar had generally been stable and the renminbi had appreciated slightly against the us dollar in july  the chinese government changed its policy of pegging the value of the renminbi to the us dollar under this policy which was halted in  due to the worldwide financial crisis the renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies in june  the chinese government announced its intention to again allow the renminbi to fluctuate within the  parameters it is possible that the chinese government could adopt an even more flexible currency policy which could result in more significant fluctuation of renminbi against the us dollar or it could adopt a more restrictive policy thus no assurance can be given that the renminbi will remain stable against the us dollar or any other foreign currency   egoos bvi’s financial statements are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the rmb the translation of rmbdenominated transactions will result in reduced revenue operating expenses and net income similarly to the extent the us dollar weakens against the rmb the translation of rmbdenominated transactions will result in increased revenue operating expenses and net income egoos bvi is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it converts the financial statements of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation if there is a change in rmb exchange rates such conversion into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income egoos bvi has not entered into agreements or purchased instruments to hedge its exchange rate risks although it may do so in the future the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transaction may be limited and egoos bvi may not be able to effectively hedge its exchange rate risks            the state administration of foreign exchange “safe” restrictions on currency exchange may limit egoos bvi’s ability to receive and use its funds effectively and to pay dividends   all of egoos bvi’s sales revenue and expenses are denominated in rmb under prc law the renminbi is currently convertible under the “current account” which includes dividends and trade and servicerelated foreign exchange transactions but not under the “capital account” which includes foreign direct investment and loans currently guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions including distributions in the form of consulting fees and payments of dividends to egoos bvi without the approval of safe by complying with certain procedural requirements however the relevant prc government authorities may limit or eliminate their ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future   all of egoos bvi’s income is derived from the consulting fees it receives from guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries through the vie agreements safe restrictions may delay the payment of dividends since guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries have to comply with certain procedural requirements and they may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the distribution of consulting fees or payment of dividends   foreign exchange transactions by prc operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with prc government authorities including safe in particular if guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries borrow foreign currency through loans from egoos bvi or other foreign lenders these loans must be registered with safe and if guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries refinance by means of additional capital contributions these capital contributions must be approved by certain prc government authorities including the prc ministry of commerce or their respective local counterparts these limitations could affect the ability of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries to conduct foreign exchange through debt or equity financing   in the future safe may make more restrictive policies or implement its policies in a tightened manner to control the foreign currency exchange the prc government also may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions if the foreign exchange control system prevents guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries from obtaining foreign currency they may be unable to pay dividends or meet obligations that may be incurred in the future that require payment in foreign currency   prc regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by prc residents may subject our prcresident beneficial owners or our prc subsidiaries to liability or penalties limit our ability to inject capital into our prc subsidiaries or limit our prc subsidiaries’ ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits   safe promulgated the circular on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange control on domestic residents’ offshore investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles or safe circular  on july   which replaced the former circular commonly known as “safe circular ” promulgated by safe on october   safe circular  requires prc residents to register with local branches of safe in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity for the purpose of overseas investment and financing with such prc residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests referred to in safe circular  as a “special purpose vehicle” safe circular  further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by prc individuals share transfer or exchange merger division or other material event in the event that a prc shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required safe registration the prc subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent crossborder foreign exchange activities and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its prc subsidiary moreover failure to comply with the various safe registration requirements described above could result in liability under prc law for evasion of foreign exchange controls according to the notice on further simplifying and improving policies for the foreign exchange administration of direct investment released on february   by safe local banks will examine and handle foreign exchange registration for overseas direct investment including the initial foreign exchange registration and amendment registration under safe circular  from june              the nationality of egoos bvi’s sole shareholder mr jie yang is the republic of guineabissau and he resides in the prc we do not have control over our beneficial owner and our future beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our prcresident beneficial owners will comply with safe circular  and subsequent implementation rules the failure of our beneficial owners who are prc resident to register or amend their foreign exchange registration in a timely manner pursuant to safe circular  and subsequent implementation rules or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are prc residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in safe circular  and subsequent implementation rules may subject such beneficial owners or our prc subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions furthermore since safe circular  was recently promulgated and it is unclear how this regulation and any future regulation concerning offshore or crossborder transactions will be interpreted amended and implemented by the relevant prc government authorities we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our prc subsidiaries and limit our prc subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends to our company these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   because all of egoos bvi’s assets are located outside of the united states and its sole director resides outside of the united states and because all of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries’ officers reside outside of the united states it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights against egoos bvi based on united states federal securities laws or against these persons in the united states or to enforce judgments of united states courts against egoos bvi or the officers or directors of egoos bvi in the prc   the sole director of egoos bvi mr jie yang as well as all of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries’ officers reside outside of the united states furthermore the operating subsidiaries guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries are located in the prc all of their assets are located outside of the united states china does not have a treaty with united states providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts it may therefore be difficult for investors in the united states to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the united states federal securities laws against egoos bvi in the courts of either the united states or the prc or france and even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the united states to enforce such judgments in the prc courts or french courts further it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the united states and the prc would permit effective enforcement against egoos bvi or its officers and directors of criminal penalties under the united states federal securities laws or otherwise   egoos bvi may have limited legal recourse under prc laws if disputes arise under contracts with third parties   the chinese government has enacted laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance foreign investment commerce taxation and trade however their experience in implementing interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is limited and egoos bvi’s ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable the resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the chinese government and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination any rights guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries may have to specific performance or to seek an injunction under prc laws in either of these cases are severely limited and without a means of recourse by virtue of the chinese legal system guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on egoos bvi’s business financial condition and results of operations although legislation in china has significantly improved the protection afforded to various forms of foreign investment and contractual arrangements in china these laws regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties which could limit the legal protection available to guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries as well as foreign investors the inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of the future agreements of guangzhou yuzhi and its subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of business business opportunities or capital and could have a material adverse impact on egoos bvi’s results of operations and future business prospects   failure to comply with the registration requirements for employee share option plans may subject our prc equity incentive plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions   on february   safe promulgated the circular of the safe on relevant issues concerning the foreign exchange administration for domestic individuals’ participating in the share incentive schemes of overseaslisted companies or safe circular  to replace the previous operating procedures for administration of domestic individuals participating in the employee stock ownership plan or stock option plan of offshore listed companies issued by safe in march  also known as “safe circular ” safe circular  regulates foreign exchange matters associated with employee stock option incentives or similar incentives permitted under applicable laws and regulations granted to prc residents by companies whose shares are listed on offshore stock exchanges            in accordance with safe circular  all prc residents who participate in share incentive plans of an overseas publiclylisted company are required through the prc subsidiary of the overseas publiclylisted company to jointly entrust a prc agent to handle foreign exchange registration with safe or its local office and complete procedures relating to the share incentive schemes such as opening accounts and capital transfers prc residents include prc nationals or foreign citizens having been consecutively residing in prc for not less than one year acting as directors supervisors senior management personnel or other employees of prc companies affiliated with such offshore listed company a prc agent can be one of the prc subsidiaries of the offshore listed company participating in the share incentive scheme or another prc institution qualified for asset trusteeship s as designated by the prc subsidiary and in accordance with prc laws the foreign exchange proceeds received by the prc residents from sale of shares under share incentive plans granted by offshore listed companies must be remitted to bank accounts in china opened by the prc agents further a notice concerning individual income tax on earnings from employee stock options jointly issued by the ministry of finance and the state administration of taxation provides that domestic companies that implement employee share option programs must file the employee share option plans and other relevant documents with local tax authorities having jurisdiction over the companies before implementing such plans and must file share option exercise notices and other relevant documents with local tax authorities before their employees exercise any share options   we may adopt an equity incentive plan and make numerous stock option grants under the plan to its officers directors and employees some of whom are prc citizens and may be required to complete the relevant foreign exchange registration procedures in accordance with safe circular  we plan to advise our employees to complete these procedures in connection with our future share incentive plans however we cannot assure you that registration procedures with safe or its local counterparts in full compliance with safe circular  will be completed on a timely basis if at all the failure to complete these procedures may subject us or our prc employees holding restricted shares or share options under our share incentive plans to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions   due to various restrictions under prc laws on the distribution of dividends by prc operating subsidiaries and vie affiliates egoos bvi may not be able to pay dividends to its stockholders   the whollyforeign owned enterprise law  as amended and the whollyforeign owned enterprise law implementing rules  as amended and the company law of the prc  contain the principal regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign owned enterprises under these regulations wholly foreign owned enterprises such as yigou may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations additionally yigou is required to set aside a certain amount of their accumulated profits each year if any to fund certain reserve funds these reserves are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital purposes   furthermore if the consolidated subsidiaries incur debt on their own in the future the instruments governing the debt may restrict egoos bvi’s ability to pay dividends or make other payments if egoos bvi or its consolidated subsidiaries and vie affiliates are unable to receive all of the revenues from operations due to these contractual or dividend arrangements egoos bvi may be unable to pay dividends   egoos bvi may have difficulty establishing adequate management governance legal and financial controls in the prc   the prc historically has been deficient in western style management governance and financial reporting concepts and practices as well as in modern banking and other control systems egoos bvi’s current management has little experience with western style management governance and financial reporting concepts and practices and it may have difficulty in hiring and

could differ from those estimates estimates are used for but not limited to the accounting for certain items such as allowance for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization impairment inventory allowance taxes and contingencies   e contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought     f        wave sync corp notes to condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and  stated in us dollars   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed   f

recovered or settled deferred taxes also are recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future income taxes   a valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will either expire before the company is able to realize that tax benefit or that future realization is uncertain   l stockbased compensation   the

average number of common stock outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding dilutive securities having an antidilutive effect on diluted earnings per share are excluded from the calculation   dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for options and warrants

there are two types of subsequent events  recognized or those that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements and  nonrecognized or those that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date     f        wave sync corp notes to condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and  stated in us dollars   s recent accounting pronouncements   on january   the fasb issued asu no  “financial instruments—overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which amends the guidance in us gaap on the classification and measurement of financial instruments although the asu retains many current requirements it significantly revises an entity’s accounting related to  the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and  the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value the asu also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december     on february   the fasb issued asu no  “leases topic ” its new standard on accounting for leases asu  introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet the new standard also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in asc  the fasb’s new revenue recognition standard eg those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized   furthermore the asu addresses other concerns related to the current leases model for example the asu eliminates the requirement in current us gaap for an entity to use brightline tests in determining lease classification the standard also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure the new model represents a wholesale change to lease accounting as a result entities will face significant implementation challenges during the transition period and beyond such as those related to     ● applying judgment and estimating   ● managing the complexities of data collection storage and maintenance   ● enhancing information technology systems to ensure their ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with reporting requirements   ● refining internal controls and other business processes related to leases   ● determining whether debt covenants are likely to be affected and if so working with lenders to avoid violations   ● addressing any income tax implications   the new guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after december   eg calendar periods beginning on january   and interim periods therein   on march   the fasb issued asu no  “investments—equity method and joint ventures topic  simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting” which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence consequently when an investment qualifies for the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and the equity method would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee the asu further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an availableforsale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which the investment qualifies for the equity method   the guidance in the asu is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for all entities entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the asu’s effective date additional transition disclosures are not required upon adoption     f        wave sync corp notes to condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and  stated in us dollars   on march   the fasb issued asu no  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” which amends the principalversusagent implementation guidance and illustrations in the board’s new revenue standard asu  the fasb issued the asu in response to concerns identified by stakeholders including those related to  determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard’s principalversusagent guidance and  applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard’s control principle among other things the asu clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer as defined in the asu a specified good or service is “a distinct good or service or a distinct bundle of goods or services to be provided to the customer” therefore for contracts involving more than one specified good or service the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods or services and the agent for others   the asu has the same effective date as the new revenue standard as amended by the oneyear deferral and the early adoption provisions in asu  in addition entities are required to adopt the asu by using the same transition method they used to adopt the new revenue standard   on march   the fasb issued asu no  “compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities including the accounting for income taxes forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification in the statement of cash flows the asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those annual reporting periods   on august   the fasb issued asu no  “statement of cash flows topic  stakeholders indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under topic  statement of cash flows and other topics this update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period as a result the company has elected to early adopt this update prospectively as of december   and prior periods retrospective adjustments have not been applied   as of december   except for the above there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have a material effect on the company’s financial statements   t fair value of financial instruments   asc  financial instruments requires that the company discloses estimated fair values of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for current assets and current liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value   the company applies the provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  defines fair value and establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures for certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents loan receivables and shortterm bank loans the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows   ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement     f
