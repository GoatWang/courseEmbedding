investment process at wilkins investment counsel inc we tailor each individual client portfolio to meet the unique needs and circumstances of that client we design and manage each separate account to

quality common stocks with a shorttointermediate term highly rated fixed income component depending on your specific considerations we calibrate the proper asset allocation and combination of individual investments to achieve the right balance between growth of principal and current income needs when making individual stock and bond investment decisions we are driven by the following criteria stock philosophy we don’t chase shortterm price fluctuations or try to “time the market”  we believe in a longterm investment strategy founded on rigorous research of the fundamentals that means investigating each company’s financials management industry attractiveness and much more these factors help determine which stocks have distinct competence features that separate them from the pack when purchasing stocks we pay strict attention to price and valuation mitigating volatility along the way by investing across a wide market capital spectrum noting that historically small capitalization stocks are more volatile than large capitalization stocks we monitor a stock’s progress continually but we don’t typically react to daybyday distractions  instead we track a company’s underlying fundamentals of course we let winners compound to further benefit our clients’ portfolio and those stocks whose fundamental progress falls short of our expectations are sold creating a sound set of investments for each of our unique clients fixed income philosophy markets can be volatile but our “buy and hold” strategy commits to wellresearched investments of high credit quality our commitment to fixed income investments ensures a stable foundation to our clients’ portfolios we invest in the corporate municipal and us government sectors using fundamental research to uncover the most attractive and stable opportunities across a wide variety of markets since we work hard to get to know everyone who invests with us we customize each portfolio to maximize our clients’ aftertax
