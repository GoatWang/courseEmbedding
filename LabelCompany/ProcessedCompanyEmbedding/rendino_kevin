capital corp undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forwardlooking statements to reflect new events or uncertainties i would now like to turn the call over to kevin rendino chief executive officer and portfolio manager of  degree capital corp kevin m rendino thanks daniel thanks everyone for joining us for what is our first earnings call for the newly formed  degree capital before during the call back over daniel who will walk you through the quarter and discuss a couple of our holdings given this is my first opportunity to speak with you in my new role i thought i would share some of my early observations as well as discuss our key strategic initiatives lets start on slide  which is the summary of the last three months were pleased our nav increased by nearly  in the quarter and our share price was up nearly  in the quarter i am firmly aware this has not been the norm over the last few years and ill have more on that in a minute we completed our restructuring we are now  degree capital corp under the new symbol turn i like to thank our board for their working in getting us here and of course our shareholders for your support over the last four months we took a considerable chunk of our expense base out and will have some added color on that and as we start q we are a new business with new leadership and a new strategy focused on investing in deeply undervalued publicly traded companies our first step in our new strategy was put in place in early january when we filed an amended d on one of our holding semiconductor company adesto daniel will talk more about that please go to slide  and then slide  first and foremost the reason for me being here the reason this company exists is the stock price i am firmly aware of the direction our stock has had over the last few years you can see that on slide  every investment we make every decision we contemplate any strategy we pursue will all start by asking ourselves the following question is this good for shareholders and is this good for turns stock price if it is we will go forward if it isnt we wont thats it ive been a public markets investor for nearly  years i have expectations for the companies that we own and the management team that run those businesses we want higher earnings and a rising stock price you all have the same expectation for us we get it its the stock price i spent my whole career in your shoes i still sit in those shoes as an investor we share your expectations of what is required of us and i view our stock price as a giant voting machine a giant scoreboard new york used to have a mayor named ed koch he was a popular figure he used to create his constituents on street corners and greet them with the slogan how am i doing were not going to have to ask our shareholders how were doing we get to see it every day in our stock price and that is what i will use to measure our success improving on our share price is why im here and thats priorities one two and three so how were going to improve our stock price slide  shows the historical trend of our nav it has not been a pretty picture we need to grow our nav end of story to do that we must extract the most value possible for the private market assets that we have and as quickly as we can some of our companies or early stage but several are midst the later stage over the ensuing months we hope to be able to share with you the potential for liquidity events for several of our holdings as far as our future strategy goes the vast majority of new investments will be made in small public companies like the one we recently made into synacor  degree capital is an investment management business attempting to hear to the concept of investing  buy low and sell higher it really isnt that complicated that is how you grow nav and that is what we plan on doing to grow nav well have more on our investment approach in a little bit slide  shows you the historical relationship between our stock price and nav as you can see we are trading at a historical low percentage of nav essentially the lowest ratio in our companys history we must narrow the discount our stock trades have relative to nav and we think we have a strategy for doing so our current share price trades at  of net asset value if  of our assets were trading in cash or liquid public market assets we would expect our stock to trade at or very close to nav because a considerable portion of our assets are private companies the lack of liquidity has led to a widespread between our stock and the nav we dig a little deeper and if your turn to slide  you will see that the discount is even greater when you look at the sum of the parts analysis if you strip out our cash in public companies our private portfolio is actually trading at  of nav not the  that everyone thinks it does not only has the streak included our private marks are not worth nav they ascribed to  discount of that value visàvis our stock heres our goal over time we will be converting each and every private market holding to cash in public companies as that happens we expect the discount to narrow – materially narrow i might add the higher adesto and synacor go the higher our cash goes with a flat nav in our private holdings our stocks are meaningfully appreciates towards our nav has the market actually truly valued our private portfolio assets and our current discount they will yield a value today of  aid our cash and liquid securities at  a share and our stock should be  higher today thats not taking into consideration the possibility that many of our portfolio holdings are actually worth nav or there i say more than nav we also want to manage third party capital this will reduce our burn faster as well as share in the profits our investors will earn and we look forward to putting together an investment that asking going out to the markets and raising third party capital slide  looks at our expenses nav needs to grow faster than our expense burn this has been a problem for our business over the past few years despite lowering our operating expenses in prior years they were still too high which is one of the primary reasons we recommend our reorganization and the removal of our bdc status we have dramatically reduced our operating expenses through reduced regulatory costs and we have lowered our expenses as well through lower head count reduce te budgets and other expenses by way of example our  expenses were  million which equates  per share or  of our nav that means our portfolio needs to rise  per year just to break even its too high a bogie our expenses in the first quarter were  million which equates to  per share or an annualized  of nav as a result of our strategy change to a closeend fund we have talked a lot about how we expect our operating expenses to be reduced im happy to now share with you some specifics by way of example we can forecast for q operating expense numbers that are significantly lower than the runway from last year and the first quarter of this year we expect our expense numbers declined to less than  million per quarter in q and our cost savings will be  quarter over quarter we hope that we will be able to offload more of that expense as we sublet our broadway new york office as well as having some of our severance run off in the next  months our next quarters expense of  per quarter  of nav or predicted to be  annualized as a percentage of our nav simply put it is easier to achieve nav growth when your expense burns is  as opposed to  more on cost savings later as to our strategy in investment process our new strategy centers on investing in undervalued small cap companies that are orphaned and removed from the etf passive world thats completely overtaken the current environment so why are we doing this we believe having a constructive activist bends in the microcap world is a differentiated solution if done effectively it should lead to attractive returns in a noncorrelated manner we are headed to a place that isnt as crowded as the index etf world of large cap investing slide  highlights a year rolling return profile dating back  years as you can see microcaps not only outperform small and large cap stocks on average but they do so over both low and high return periods slide  shows the orphan nature of the aspect of the group companies with market caps of  million and less are covered by only  of wall street analysts this group is simply not as picked over as other asset classes slide  is a little good news bad news scenario by definition we like our companys management teams to have skin in the game if a stock does well we as shareholders do well coinciding with the management and the board doing well as you can see from the slide the average insider ownership of sub  million market cap is  far exceeding higher capitalization companies we know management teams like to pad their own wallets so high ownership generally means the interest of the companys management team and investors are aligned that said sometimes too much ownership will scare us off sometimes a change in business strategy may be necessary to propel a stock higher if the company doesnt share the vision shareholders have or is unwilling to alter its strategy substantial insider ownership can actually work again shareholders so with the balance slide  should be selfexplanatory over the last  years nearly  of mergers occurred with companies that were some sub  million market cap slide  shows the noncorrelation aspect to our asset class i view the investing world right now as being one giant etf not our space  is the actual number we feel good about tracking in a group of stocks that the world isnt paying attention to as far as our own process goes you can see our investment process highlighted on slide  we are graham and dodd value investors focused on investing in companies that trade at twothirds the market on either price to earnings price to cash flow price to sales or half the market on price to book or have an above average dividend yields although i must say you dont find that all that often in this asset class once we screen for companies that fit our fundamental profile we do a deep dive researching the business speaking with management industry contacts wall street analysts and the rest there always needs to be a reason for ownership we want to own cheap stocks but being cheap is just the price of admission to become an actual holding up  degree we need more than just being an inexpensive stock we want to own companies where we can identify a catalyst whereby if that catalyst comes to fruition it will cause the stock to move higher we assemble our own components for strategy to improve the financial performance of the target company there could be a management change a new product specific operating model changes whatever it is we need to have a reason to believe we will attempt to work with management teams and boards to affect change it is all meant to be collegial and not antagonistic at least in the beginning turning to slide  you can see the evolution of our form of constructive activism phase one is identifying quality deep undervalued companies with strong management teams in the process of executing a turnaround these companies do not require substantial timer involvement essentially what we have here are companies that have already gone some sort of outside activism in the past or the board has pursued its own changes without outside pressure our new position in synacor is an example of this several years ago the the board made significant changes to its business and its management the work has already been done but investors have yet to reap the rewards danny will talk more about this later phase two is investing the same company as phase one except small changes are necessary to effect change it could be enhanced investor relations strategies or small focus changes to the operating model which could lead to improve financial performance more time is involved in phase  but its not substantial phase  are companies that need dramatic change to its board or its management team proposing drastic fundamental change to a companys business it could be advocating or sell the company in certain instances sometimes it can mean proxy campaigns and taking seats on the board our hope is never to get here but you have to be willing to do it or companies wont take you seriously all in all we prefer phases  and  types of investments the hard work has already been done by either an activist or the board and the management itself the stock hasnt moved all that much as the company was undergoing it exchanges and time has already elapsed the turnaround is coming sooner rather than later essentially we want to be the first one in but early enough to benefit from a companys turn and yes that was a pun intended with that let me turn our call over to daniel to review the quarter daniel wolfe thanks kevin as kevin mentioned previously we completed our transition from a business development company to a register closedend funds on march   with this change we are no longer required to file our quarterly financial statements on form q and instead file a schedule of investments on form nq in this document we have provided the updated valuation of our portfolio of companies as well as the calculation of net assets and net asset value per share we are pleased to report that the net assets increased by approximately  million or  from  million as of december   to  million as of march   net asset value per share increased by  or  from  as of december   to  as of march   the value of our investment portfolio netted approximately  million of cash invested during the quarter increased in value by approximately  million or  per share our expenses investing in restricted stock during the quarter accounted for a decrease in value of approximately  a share we no longer have any restricted stock outstanding two companies adesto and nanosys accounted for substantially all of the increases in value during the quarter ngx bio senova systems and potential milestone payments from the acquisition of molecular imprints by canon accounted for the majority of our decreases in value we ended the quarter with approximately  million in cash and we currently have approximately  million in cash on hand i would like to speak about the largest increase in value in our portfolio during the quarter adesto technologies corporation please refer to slide  as many of you already know adesto is a publicly traded company that trades under the symbol iots adesto completed its ipo in october  at a price per share  the stock subsequently rose to a high of  before decreasing substantially throughout the year to a low of  we own approximately  million shares of adesto while kevin did not formally join as ceo until march   we changed our passive approach of managing this investment to an active approach as discussed in our d filing on january   since this point in early january we have been actively engaged with management of adesto to convey our thoughts and ideas regarding primarily messaging and spending on rd many of our proposals were reflected in their updated presentation materials and investor communications we were also pleased to see it spend on rd decrease from prior quarters and their commitment to continue to decrease these levels as a percentage of overall revenue adesto stock was trading at  on january   it was trading at  as of march   and it closed at  yesterday we are obviously pleased with this trend the largest decrease in value in our portfolio during the quarter was ngx bio due to risks associated with its ongoing financing requirements additionally we did not receive a potential milestone payments associated with the acquisition of molecular imprints by canon and we decreased the probabilities associated with the receipt of milestone payments associated with the sale of the assets of s senova to an undisclosed corporation that said a number of our most mature privately held companies continue to make progress building their respective businesses please refer to slide  dwave systems announced the sale of its new  qubit system to temporal data systems the  qubit upgrade system will also be installed at the quantum artificial intelligence lab run by google nasa and the university space research association additionally volkswagen announced a collaboration with dwave on the traffic flow optimization project agbiome received epa approval for its first product a biological fungicide products marketed as zio for use in turf and ornamental applications hzo continues to penetrate the tablet automotive audio and wearable market with its differentiated waterproofing solutions nanosys announced that it partnered with the chinese film manufacturer exciton to bring its quantum dot enhancement films to market alongside existing partners m and hitachi mersana presented data at the recent american association for cancer research annual meeting that supported the efficacy and tolerability of its clinical stage antibodies drug conjugate therapeutic for cancer i note that these five companies have a collective valuation of approximately  million or more than the  million in value that our stock price currently reflects on our private portfolio as a whole if cash and public securities are valued at full value as kevin mentioned we also have a number of early stage companies that comprise the remaining  million of our portfolio of assets while  degree capital technically began as a company on march   as kevin mentioned he and i have been actively in diligence on number of potential investment opportunities since announcing this transition in december  in february  we were introduced to a company called synacor that trades under the symbol sync please refer to slide  synacor is a technology development multiplatform services and revenue provider for video internet and communication providers device manufacturers and enterprises through its managed portals and advertising solutions the company enables its customers to earn revenues by monetizing media across their customers the companys reoccurring and fee based revenue solutions include endtoend advanced video services email and collaboration services cloud based authentication and paid content and premium services when we began our diligence on the company it was trading at  per share during the period between our introduction and our investment we became increasingly convinced that this company was a deeply undervalued and could be a very interesting investment opportunity owing to factors including synacor has a high quality management team that joined in  and is executing on a plan to reach  million in and  million in ebitda in  the company won atts portal business from yahoo in may  which we believe was a potential transformative event this business has projected to generate  million in annual revenue starting in the second half of  the company successfully integrated acquisitions as zimbra technorati and nimbletv when combined with its cloud id authentication technology we believe this suite of products provides a platform for growth of high margin reoccurring revenue streams alongside its portal and advertising businesses synacor has a strong balance sheet when combined with its strengthening income statement and overall business execution we believe these factors support a substantially higher valuation that is currently ascribed to the company the companys stock ran up to a high of  following the announcement in march  that was on schedule to launch the att portal in the second half of this year we remain patient during this time looking for the right opportunity to purchase a meaningful position in the company the secondary offering presented such an opportunity we believe we received a meaningful allocation in the oversubscribed financing owing to our early activate and constructive engagement with synacors management ill now turn the call back to kevin for closing remarks before we open the lines to questions kevin m rendino thanks daniel ive talked to a number of you over the past four months and i plan on talking to all of you in the ensuing months by now you should know the reason for me being here we want to get this stock price higher and that is going to be how we measure our success to do so we have to narrow the discount to nav visàvis our share price we need to increase our nav share through investment appreciation and we need to decrease and eliminate the drag on the nav from noninvestment activities through minimizing day to day operating expenses as much as possible as well as generating income for managing thirdparty capital or other sources were  aligned with shareholders we must increase the price of our stock to truly be successful we think were on our way to doing so and we look forward to reporting to you on our ensuing quarters thanks daniel now well take some questions questionandanswer session a  daniel wolfe operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael morelli michael please go ahead michael morelli in this restructuring what is the effect of – what is the – is there a reduction or an increase in executive compensation and if so what are the percentages in terms of higher or lower kevin m rendino thanks mike for your question as we said it in our earlier comments expenses were roughly  or  of our nav in year  and we expect to get that number down to  for the balance of this year and potentially even lower for next year were not going to breakout each line item of our expense base but our expenses are materially lower with the newer reorganization michael morelli i was concerned that that you know all the executives coming more and more people are getting paid that the executive part was going to chub kevin m rendino we actually have less people now than we had before by a factor of  youll see executive compensation visàvis our proxy which will go out – which is out the proxy is out so you can look at our compensation for last year and then of course this years compensation will be reflected in our proxy in  but expenses are going down we have less people and so all of the things that you want from us were delivering on daniel wolfe and youll see in the proxy materials actually that the – it talks about who is with the firm going for it and who is not with the firm going for it and you can see that as kevin mentioned we have dramatically reduced the headcount and are really focused on you know building value for shareholders michael morelli thank you daniel wolfe our next question comes along as tom bonsudo tom bonsudo yes good morning gentlemen thank you for the call appreciate it just a few clarifying questions if i may as i observed the and i want to make sure i get my data right here so the synacor purchase if i did my numbers right is it about a  position that you have in synacor of synacor daniel wolfe thats about right tom bonsudo okay and then… kevin m rendino  million divided by the assets you are talking about almost a  position tom bonsudo okay so somewhere in that range and then adesto if ive got my numbers its about  of the debt is that correct daniel wolfe thats correct tom bonsudo okay so if were to compare those two companies and we think about what your strategy is going forward do you feel there is certainly percentage that you need to achieve in order to have the influence you want to have to make the changes you want to make kevin m rendino so it depends obviously the more ownership you have by definition the more influence youll have a lot depends upon the boards you can own  of the business but if youve got an entrenched board and management team with a significantly higher percentage of ownership then you have it becomes little more difficult you can have a couple of board – if you go into another position that kind of hasnt worked and stock prices sort of done nothing for a long period of time and you may have a couple of board members that are really uneasy but dont know how to go about actually affecting change even with the position of  or  you can affect some change so it truly does depend tom on the individual company obviously the more you own the more influence you should have generally speaking thats true it doesnt practically work that way all the time were not going to take a position in a company thats less than  to  to  though any new positions will have significant ownership in tom bonsudo okay and then along those lines on slide  it refers to you know in your process here that youve outlined low inside ownership and maybe you give me a similar answer but when you – it depends but is there a kind of a level of inside ownership that you say while hey its the inside ownership as soon as executive manager and the board is less than a certain this level thats of a good screening because were doing the screenings typically its somewhat quantitative but some of the things you have there are more qualitative kevin m rendino so you got to at the page  shareholders but anything that approaches sort of  is an outlier meaning we really need to feel good about the business and the strategy the business for us to get involved if we look at something and we think the business strategy is completely flawed and we think there are a number of changes that need to be made and the insider ownership is  probably not going to get involved if you look at a company like us cellular for instance and by the way it doesnt necessarily only come from ownership it also comes from some dual class stock in other words you get in involved in a lot of these that have class a and class b stocks so thats going to be  but if there is sumner redstone they own the entire voting rights of the companies we are not going to get involved in any of that us cellular by example of a larger name is one then no matter what we think of us cellular not that its a position from  im just using it as a reference this point until that family decides to actually do the right thing the stock is going to be  for life if they decide to do the right thing itd be  in a heartbeat but you cant – we dont want to bang our heads against the wall fighting management when we know at the end of the day were going to lose so anything nearing  is a flag for sure actually anything sort of at the  is a flag tom bonsudo and then you know you talked a lot about investing in microcap where you can really have an influence yet on pages  through  it actually and your titled all reference of small cap i was thrown off by that little can you speak to that kevin m rendino sorry those slides that i referenced are – its really microcap now it depends how you define it but we are focused on microcaps but we are also focus on small caps so sort of the  million and below you have to define microcap at how you want to define it we are focused on the smallest of small right now given our own asset base and so thats why you should take a look at the blue charts or the blue bar as opposed to the orange bar and the black bar in slide  tom bonsudo okay alright great thank you guys kevin m rendino thanks tom daniel wolfe thanks tom next comes from skagen capital please go ahead unidentified analyst hey guys congrats on the quarter i just noticed cash seem to have decreased from end of year till may about  million i think you mentioned investment in synacor and then maybe some ga probably ish million where is the other  million and then stock buyback i know you guys had a program in place just curious to hear your thoughts given the discount to nav daniel wolfe yeah so during the quarter there was – there were other investments that were made as well so you had  million that went into hale you have  that went into tara biosystems and then you have operating expenses during the quarter in terms of the cash burn during the quarter kevin m rendino in future quarters were going to actually use cash plus liquid securities and you should look at that as one bucket as opposed to just cash or as opposed to just liquid securities we want to build the buckets for both of those as a percentage of our assets and thats the goal here over the next three years in terms of certain share repurchase im firmly aware of where the stock trades relatives to nav to me its not the right price the market has decided it is the right price today we will as the board and the management team assess asset allocation decisions visàvis the cash that we have its not like were sitting a tremendous amount of cash right now and weve used some of it to imitate our new strategy but rest assured we think about share repurchase in a matter that you want us to think about it and on top of that as you can see from prior reporting of periods insiders have actually been buying stock as well so you know if we can figure out a way to do it and then continue to still run our strategy and share repurchase is going to make a lot of sense for us unidentified analyst thanks daniel wolfe next question from the line palogic unidentified analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question the last caller asked the question i was going to ask but could you may be further give it little more details or relates to how you think about share repurchases and if and when it wouldnt make sense i mean so from a third party looking at your private portfolio we dont have the information that youve got as it relates to the ability to judge the value of that and kind of your confidence level that a the largest positions your most mature private portfolio companies are valued kind of at where you say they are versus the downside and kind of the upside that may exist there et cetera so you are in a better position to judge that and maybe the market and so how do you make that determination how do you think about that kevin m rendino so ive – weve asked the same questions to the companies that we own i expect you to ask that question of us and we ask ourselves that question every day its really an asset allocation decision just because the market thinks our stock price at  is what the current true value of the business is we dont necessarily agree with that our nav is the nav for a reason its audited marks on private businesses by price waterhouse and duff and phelps we dont make these numbers up they are what they are many of our companies are marked because of rounds of finance its based on and the market caps of those rounds when the rounds were done so we see what other investors have been willing to pay for businesses in the private world we take share repurchase very seriously we want to make sure that we balance that against actually making investment decisions on behalf of our shareholders visàvis our public companies if i had more money i would do both today because we are i would say – we can argue cash starved the challenges are greater than if we had twice the amount of cash sitting on our balance sheet thats not to suggest that were not going to go in and buy stock thats not to suggest at all that were – that share repurchases is not on the table because it is – we just want to make smart asset allocation decisions based on the cash that we have we take share repurchase very seriously and i dont think that  is the right price and my way reflecting that to you was if you go back and look in in the one week that i havent been restricted this year i was in the open market buying stock in my personal account so that shares with you the confidence that i have not only in our business strategy but in our portfolio of assets that we currently have unidentified analyst okay and then would you not consider a margin borrowings are you out of the borrowing game kevin m rendino so bbdc means we can use less leverage today than we could before im not really a leverage guy i mean money is cheap we know that the last thing im going to do is lever up this balance sheet its just not – its not part of my investment process in my past might we use some leverage at some point perhaps its certainly not something that we think about doing or something we are going to be doing in the next six months unidentified analyst okay fantastic thank you very much daniel wolfe operator instructions our next question comes from anonymous caller please go ahead sam robosky hi its sam robosky kevin and dan its been – this is a good start now tell me the cash at the  million as of may what was the cash as of march  and what are expectations of creating cash for the june quarter daniel wolfe so cash as of the end of the quarter was  million you know the bulk of the transition of cash top from the  million to the  million obviously was the investment in synacor and then some operating expenses we dont give guidance as to you know the expectations for conversion of cash securities to cash i think we believe there are meaningful opportunities to see liquidity events in the portfolio but i think this is also why were going to be speaking about cash plus liquid securities going forward because the portfolio will be dynamic and we have the more flexibility to do so with the liquid positions kevin i dont know if you want to add anything to that kevin m rendino sam this is a business that historically when i joined the board in april was in run off and harris actually wasnt even in business they had a portfolio of private businesses with too high burn and were not really making any new investments they were trying to make followon investments but the only way they were able to do that because the burn the so high was to sell other positions and it was selfdefeating and harris  harris was getting itself into forced liquidations weve gotten ourselves in a position with where the end of the year we sold metabolon where our cash position was pretty strong adesto has risen as daniel said in his earlier comment from  to  you can look at that we view that as cash now maybe its not  percent of cash youve got to sell it there could be some discount there if you had to sell it but we look at that as cash so we are going to convert these private market holdings these private market – private equity holdings and we are going to convert them when they become liquid we are going to take that cast were either going to put it on the balance sheet or going to invest it in the public markets were going to use it for share repurchase or just hand it back to shareholders and so you just need to simply look at the combination of cash and liquid securities just dont look at cash sam robosky okay thats good kevin m rendino cash could be  million dollars next quarter but thats because we found the  million investment in something a public company so lets look at that by combining the two sam robosky kevin how many situations would you say you are presently looking at and what stages would you say they would be if you had the appropriate cash would you pull the trigger to invest in or are investing in kevin m rendino so there is one that if the quarter ended today we would have a new position we havent reflected that yet in our – on our balance sheet or in our statements its not a large position its a small starter position we are looking to get bigger in that name theres a number of factors that it will be easier to get bigger if something happens and it will be impossible to get bigger if something doesnt happen so were in the middle of one right now and were looking at id say two or three others but there is one thats sort of i would it hot on the press sam robosky alright well i guess… kevin m rendino if i can put the same amount of investment – if i can put the same amount of investment in that one as we did synacor we would do it sam robosky sounds good i think the approach is good kevin and i think time will show that you are probably going to be right because this approach has worked over the past it just takes time and its a change and people have to know you are changing okay good luck kevin m rendino thanks daniel wolfe thank you so we are not showing any additional questions in the queue kevin m rendino with that thank you very much for taking the time today you can find myself or daniel visàvis email or call us if you have any further questions we look forward to chatting with you down the road or seeing you if your travels take you
