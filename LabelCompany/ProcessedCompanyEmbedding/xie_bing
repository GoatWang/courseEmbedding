data applications challenges  perspectives morocco march   keynote speech “social media analysis via continuous learning” adobe text analytics summit feb   older talks  introduction this work is in the area of sentiment analysis and opinion mining from social media eg reviews forum discussions and blogs in our kdd paper we proposed the featurebased opinion mining model which is now also called aspectbased opinion mining as the term feature here can confuse with the term feature used in machine learning the output of such opinion mining is a featurebased opinion summary or aspectbased opinion summary the commonly known sentiment classification is a subtask our current work is in two main areas which reflect two kinds of opinions or evaluations mining regular or direct opinions ex  this camera is great  after taking the drug i got stomach pain mining comparative opinions ex coke tastes better than pepsi since  we have also worked on fake review and opinion spam detection fake reviews are also called bogus reviews or fraudulent reviews see the papers www wsdm cikma cikmb www  sentiment analysis or mining of regular opinions in this research we aim to mine and to summarize online opinions in reviews tweets blogs forum discussions etc specifically we mine features or aspects of entities eg products or topics on which people have expressed their opinions and determine whether the opinions are positive or negative for opinion summarization we advocate the quantitative aspect and the target of opinions because  of the people say something is bad is not the same as  say it is bad abstraction of the problem featurebased opinion mining and summarization aspectbased opinion mining and summarization of multiple reviews kdd and www formal definitions can be found in my book sentiment analysis and opinion mining they are based on several of our papers in  and  the abstraction provides a model of online opinions describes what should be extracted from opinion sources eg reviews forums and blogs and how the results may be organized and presented to the user the main mining tasks are mining entities and their features or aspects that have been commented on or evaluated by people determining whether the commentopinion on each entity feature or aspect is positive negative or neutral aspectbased sentiment classification and summarizing the results  sentiment analysis of comparative opinions a comparative sentence usually expresses an ordering relation between two sets of entities with respect to some shared features or aspects for example the comparative sentence canons optics are better than those of sony and nikon expresses the comparative relation better  comparative sentences use different language constructs from typical opinion sentences eg cannons optic is great abstraction of the problem which is better than which on what again the formal definitions can be found in my book sentiment analysis and opinion mining the main mining tasks are identify comparative sentences from texts eg reviews forum or blog postings and news articles extract comparative relations from the identified comparative sentences opinion lexicon or sentiment lexicon opinion lexicon a list of english positive and negative opinion words or sentiment words around  words this list was compiled over many years starting from our first paper hu and liu kdd comparative words a list of nonstandard english compariative words and phrases for sentiment analysis this list was compiled over many years starting from our first paper jindal and liu sigir although necessary having an opinion lexicon is far from sufficient for accurate sentiment analysis see this paper sentiment analysis and subjectivity or the sentiment analysis book try search for the best restaurant based on specific aspects eg best burger friendliest service the system is a demo which uses the lexicon also phrases and grammatical analysis for opinion mining data sets annotated customer review datasets  products associated with the paper hu and liu kdd annotated additional customer review datasets  products some used in ding liu and yu wsdm which improves the lexiconbased method proposed in hu and liu kdd annotated more customer review datasets  products used in liu et al ijcai amazon product review data more than  million reviews used in jindal and liu www wsdm lim et
