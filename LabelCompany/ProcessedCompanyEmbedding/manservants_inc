uber life as a manondemand at manservants the uber of hot dudes male strippers are a handmedown fantasy from men manservants are a finer artisan product by carmel deamicis nov   5am est tweet share linkedin manservants alex milone is shirtless as usual running his hand through his tousled brown locks he belts out the lyrics to the song “riptide” on facetime as his roommate strums the ukulele beside him they live on a boat off pier 9 in san francisco near the fisherman’s wharf tourist district with his impish grin easy demeanor and kendoll looks yearold milone is everything the manservants video promised he would be part entertainers part eye candy these ondemand male entertainers called manservants are meant to be a classier option than male strippers for a bachelorette party or other event clients can pay 5 per hour to “rent” a manservant to make drinks give massages lead party games listen to attendees and otherwise charm the hostess and her friends or — on occasion — the host and his friends the company has raised an undisclosed amount of seed money to develop a mobile app for ordering up goodlooking guys in or out of suits a youtube commercial for the san franciscobased dudesondemand service went viral a year ago hitting more than half a million views after it was picked up by the guardian time the san francisco chronicle gq the globe and mail cosmo huffington post refinery racked and an array of tech publications and local news shows in the video a handsome lothario in a tux released a flock of doves as a woman arrived at a party looking like a sexy secret service operative another tuxclad stud held a parasol over a lady’s head as she strolled down the street a third beefcake bobbed in a pool his pecs visible through his completely drenched suit as he refilled the champagne flute of a suntanning woman when it launched manservants could be booked within a few hours of an event so the service was quickly dubbed “the uber of hot dudes” “san francisco’s weirdest new startup” and indelible proof of a tech bubble recode reporter liz gannes tried to order one for her series on the instant gratification economy and was stuck on the wait list many assumed that the company was a parody or a prank but what looked like a joke a year ago is now a business with a presence in three cities and more than  manservants like milone on its contractor payroll the company’s founders both women say the company is about to turn the corner on profitability “we call it chivalry in the age of beyoncé” said manservants cofounder josephine wai lin 2 who started manservants with her yearold cofounder dalal khajah they came up with the concept over a cigarette break at work they were both copy editors at a digital advertising agency in san francisco many of their friends were getting married and wai lin and khajah attended their fair share of bachelorette parties with the requisite awkward stripper show they wanted hot male assistants to show up instead — someone to pamper them pour drinks and play party games instead of blasting the boom box and shimmying in a manthong a professional videographer friend offered to help them test the idea by producing a manservants commercial when the ad spread virally across the web wai lin and khajah quit their day jobs and started building the company in san francisco eventually growing the business to los angeles and new york “when we launched the video we got over  emails from production companies wanting to develop a reality tv show following manservants” wai lin said on a recent call with recode when asked whether the show was in development she said she couldn’t discuss it to book a manservant people go to the website a lush affair in blacks and golds that looks like a promotional page for an exclusive new york city club customers are prompted with a list of options — hire a manservant at sporting events so he can wait on the restroom line for you or during a girl’s night out so he can shoo away douchebags the manservants website prompts women with events for which they could book a manservant manservants the clients pick the date event address and time — unlike in the early days reservations now need to be made 2 hours in advance when the mobile app launches the founders hope to return the service to its truly “on demand” roots with bookings in a few hours on the site customers check a box telling the manservant whether to arrive with flowers an extra 0 fee they get to make up the fake “name” for their fella which he’ll go by for the entire evening the men are forbidden from revealing their real names occupations or identities to the clients customers even decide whether they want a “butler” to wait quietly on the sidelines for direction or a “showman” who will “get the party turned up” as a business manservants is by no means a runaway success wai lin wouldn’t give numbers of events booked but she said that he company has served roughly 0 individuals and that each party had been attended by four to  people run the math and that’s roughly  events in a year — not exactly uber numbers but the company’s real revenue hasn’t come from the smaller bachelorette parties or birthday events big corporate clients — hollywood parties and redcarpet events — are the ones that bring in the cash manservants form the wall of compliments at an event manservants clusters of manservants went to screenings of “magic mike xxl” across the nation escorted moms at the premiere of the bravo scripted series “girlfriends’ guide to divorce” and floated around at cosmopolitan magazine’s th birthday party they’re trained beforehand learning to do event stunts like creating a “wall of compliments” in which fellows form two lines and shower the person who walks between them with praise another is the “photo booth” where they hoist someone up sideways for a photo opportunity manservants perform the “photo booth” stunt posing with attendees for pictures at cosmo’s th anniversary party manservants wai lin and khajah want to build manservants into a national brand to rival chippendales for them it’s a feminist mission “male strippers are a handmedown fantasy from men” wai lin said “did you know chippendales was invented by a man who was dating a playboy of the year and he raped her and shot her” it’s a true and not entirely surprising story given that the chippendales brand reeks of cheese and skeez manservants has its own problems it’s inventing a new kind of business — never an easy task thanks to channing tatum and his bros the public at large understands the malestripper business but what the hell is a “manservant” and what do you do with one the boatdwelling shirtshunning milone said he saw the confusion firsthand at some of the events he worked “we show up and a third of the party understands who we are — they know about manservants a third don’t have any idea what the fuck we are and a third thinks we’re an escort service” he said “you’re not being paid to be there for sex but i could always feel a very strong sexual energy” two manservants deliver pizza manservants malone claims he’s never bedded a client — but some of them have put the moves on him most memorably at a yearold’s birthday party “four of the women who were her friends were like ‘you’ve got to get on this girl” malone said these days the manservants’ site is crystal clear no hankypanky manservants are trained to keep their clothes on and clients are warned that the service doesn’t come with sex on the side milone was one of manservants’ earliest recruits he joined after watching that viral video he was trying to start his own company at the time and saw the side gig as a weird kind of personal development “it feeds my ego” milone said without an ounce of selfconsciousness “it’s hard for me to accept that chicks actually like me sometimes” little flashes of nervousness — a quick shoulder shrug a lip bite — peeked through his bravado as he regaled me with tales of ondemand servitude malone made almost  at the yearold’s birthday party which was his first gig not exactly the hot young bachelorettes he might have hoped for when he signed up “one of us was massaging her feet while the other one was spoonfeeding her dessert” he recalled “this went on for fourandahalf hours” he has done a few other manservants gigs since then — a birthday party for a twentysomething and a baby shower for a thirtysomething — but he hasn’t kept it up regularly because he couldn’t get over his confidence issues manservants offers a gender role reversal both for the men working the jobs and the women who pay for them new recruits are trained to be attentive and accommodating to women’s needs predicting what they want before they want it — stereotypically a woman’s role in a romantic relationship have the clients been drinking a lot of alcohol snag water bottles to hydrate them before they ask are they feeling left out of the festivities chat them up to keep them company bored read them shakespeare sonnets or offer to do pushups with them on your back the men tell me that the latter is a frequent request potential recruits do online training on emotional intelligence answering questions about what a woman might be thinking or feeling based on photos they also have to brainstorm compliments showing that they can flatter ladies on the fly a “chivalry” question from the manservants training manservants many of the manservants are also in the entertainment industry so the job is a natural extension of their interests and skills in san francisco they get the startup founders and finearts performers in los angeles the comedians and actors and in new york the “adonises” — models right off the highfashion runway when booking women select their top three choices from a smorgasbord of pictures manservants keeps an eye on the ebbs and flows of what women desire “they want lumbersexuals and silver foxes” wai lin said rattling off recent requests “manbuns are very big these days we should develop a manbun extension that the guys can put in the kardashians started a bit of a trend in their taste because we have a lot of requests for dark gentlemen we try to stay away from stereotypical ‘latin lover’ even though our clients might say that we never want to objectify our guys” despite wai lin’s protests objectification is inevitably part of the experience unlike greasemonkey steroidpumped male strippers there are no unattractive manservants every single one of them could’ve walked out of an abercrombie  fitch catalogue many complain that if the genders were reversed manservants would likely be pilloried for sexism “can you imagine” the typical complaint goes “a company called ‘ladyservants’ offering up hot women to wait on men” that’s so valid because “hooters” isn’t a thing anyway the manservants i spoke with said the objectification was part of the fun “there’s no risk for the women involved and it was awesome to see that expressed” milone said “they felt comfortable they’re bossing you around they’re appreciating you as a man more fully” another manservant i spoke with jamie michaels  agreed with milone “you have to be comfortable with getting hit on” he said “you show up all dolled up in the suit you know what’s going on” i surreptitiously google michaels as we talk by phone with sharp cheekbones and kind eyes he looks like a disney prince who stepped out of the animated world and into real life jamie michaels in his manservants suit jamie michaels for the last year michaels has spent nearly every saturday entertaining at a bachelorette party or girl’s night out for manservants like milone he has had his share of weird encounters there was that time he modeled the lingerie that a bridetobe received from her friends — putting the bras and gstrings on over his suit another time he helped a drunk bachelorette party reenact the famous scene from “dirty dancing” where johnny castle lifts baby in the air it all went well until the bridetobe made the leap “i saw everyone’s faces like ‘no no no’ and i look up and she wasn’t wearing underwear” michaels remembered he sees the work as a big lesson on the female psyche it has helped him romantically he said because he’s learned how to listen and pay attention to body cues “i’m pretty vulnerable on dates now” michaels said “i’m more in tune with that side of me”  name changed to protect identity recodedivider more from recode meg whitman is being considered for the uber ceo job —
