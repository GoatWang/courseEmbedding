organized to develop treatments for a family of viruses known as lipid enveloped diseases such as hepatitis b and c hivaids herpes and epstein barr are included in this family of common viruses while the company still believes there remains great promise in treating many human afflictions with properly administered  mixtures this is no longer our focus at this time as of  we began pursuing a new initiative that has since shown great promise in the area of hospital disinfection by redirecting the company into this area of growing global concern management and medizone’s science team rightly believed that a revenue stream could be developed quickly and at far less cost than through the pursuit of human therapies a series of research initiatives spanning  through to late  investigating new and innovative equipment and protocols for use in destroying the main causative agents of hospital acquired infections resulted in an unprecedented success across a broad spectrum of bacteria spores

exploded in the past decade by  admissions were triple the number in  and fold higher than in  in  in the united states alone  hospital admissions for mrsa — including  invasive infections — resulted

the greatest threats to public health and safety in the industrial world see cdc report here httpwwwcdcgovncidoddhqppdfarinvasivemrsajamapdf report httpwwwcdcgovncidoddhqparmrsainvasivefshtml this concern was reflected in an article recently published in the science magazine the bacteria fight back  vol  no   july  pp  by gary taubes which estimated that hospitalbased infections in  accounted for almost  deaths in the us alone corporate redirection towards full hospital decontamination since  as stated above early in  the company’s management and board of directors began to consider other applications of the company’s core technologies and new technologies with lower development costs with the objective of moving the company to revenue production in the shortest period of time since that time management has succeeded in positioning the company and its recently developed flagship disinfection and decontamination technology asepticsure in readiness for what it believes will be a phenomenal growth opportunity in the field of hospital sterilization this change in focus was based in part on a review of published data on hospitalderived infections an area of rapidly growing concern in the medical community management determined in early  that there was an outstanding opportunity to build on the company’s experience with ozone technologies and its biooxidative qualities in pursuing this initiative the company subsequently shifted its then near term efforts towards one of its founding tenets namely that under the right conditions ozone can be extremely effective at sterilizing virtually all biological fluids blood serum and plasma and its fractionates as well as all biologically contaminated equipment and spaces the company believes that medizone’s unique ozone generating technologies can and will play a vital role in addressing what public health officials and surgeons worldwide are beginning to recognize as “the silent epidemic” american academy of orthopedic surgeons may  copy on file with the company “aaos study” a reference to mrsa methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus infection today medizone is poised to tackle the problems associated

submit asepticsure for fda approval as a medical device kalamazoo michigan friday april   — medizone international inc otcqb mzei announced that in a scheduled conference call late thursday april   with representatives of the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda had advised the company that they believed asepticsure should be classified as a medical device  the fda representatives recommended that the company submit a premarket notification “pmn” or “k” to the fda and invited company representatives to schedule follow up meetings to discuss the best approach for introduction of the asepticsure technology into the us market  section k of the food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” requires device manufacturers who must register to notify fda of their intent to market a medical device at least  days in advance this is known as premarket notification – also called pmn or k this allows fda to determine whether the device is equivalent to a device already placed into one of the three classification categories  specifically medical device manufacturers are required to submit a premarket notification if they intend to introduce a device into commercial distribution for the first time or reintroduce a device that will be significantly changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness could be affected such change or modification could relate to the design material chemical composition energy source manufacturing process or intended use in november  medizone received clearance from the us environmental protection agency “epa” reg no  to market asepticsure ozone disinfectant formula for use for disinfection of nonporous surfaces in hospitals clinics hotels sporting venues and in the food industry longterm care facilities and other critical infrastructures  however the fda has indicated that it also believes it has jurisdiction over asepticsure as a “medical device”  the company does not agree with the fda’s position however the company has determined to work with its advisors on a response to the fda to establish the most efficient route to gain regulatory approval of asepticsure as a medical device under the fdca the company has informed the fda that it will not market asepticsure in the us under the previously announced epa clearance until it has also obtained k clearance or other appropriate approvals from the fda medizone will continue to support commercial operations in markets outside the united states which are not affected by this decision  in addition to the epa clearance the asepticsure technology has received
