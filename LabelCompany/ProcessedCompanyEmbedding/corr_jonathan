h corr  president chief executive officer  director great thanks lisa good afternoon everyone i am truly excited to share with you our fantastic results for the quarter and year these results reflect our ongoing momentum as we continue to pursue our goal of automating the complex mortgage origination process our strong fourth quarter results capped a tremendous year for ellie mae and we exceeded expectations across all metrics we grew revenues by  yearoveryear to  million adjusted ebitda increased  to  million we delivered seat bookings that soared to an alltime high of  with more than half of this coming from new customers for the year revenue increased  to  million and adjusted ebitda grew  to  million our results for  represent the strongest performance in our company history we further solidified our market leadership in the industry continued our profitable growth rate and delivered financial results that exceeded expectations without question we are very proud of this performance and our team that achieved it our q and full year outperformance was driven by strong momentum across our entire business as we expanded our user base and drove increased adoption of our product offerings new customer seats booked during the quarter were a record  as a greater percentage of mortgage origination volume has shifted from mega lenders to large and midsized lenders we have seen our customers continue to grow their businesses adding more seats and conducting more transactions across our network the strength of our customer base is also highlighted by the number of seats they added during the quarter which totaled  overall we expanded our market share to a  active encompass users at yearend a  increase over last year the respatila integrated mortgage disclosure rule became effective during the quarter and we continue to see compliance being a key driver for automation and a demand for encompass we see continued regulatory and agency changes scheduled for the next several years as we discussed on prior calls during the year the mortgage origination market shifted toward purchases and forecast is expected to remain a purchasedominant market for this foreseeable future although economists forecast a slow rise in interest rates origination volume projections also show a material increase in purchase volumes for  and  we expect that modest interest rate movements will have little to no effect on the overall demand for home purchases likewise we expect such rate changes to have minimal impact on our financial results and seat bookings as we enter  we plan to build on the success of the last year allregs has experienced strong traction throughout  and has further positioned ellie mae as a cornerstone of compliance solutions our expanded goto market plans for the allregs solutions will enable us to further penetrate our existing customer base in addition were in the process of rolling out the strategic partnerships we established with fannie mae and freddie mac in  these comprehensive integrations will allow ellie mae customers to more easily originate and deliver highquality loans to the governmentsponsored enterprises lastly in the coming year we will introduce both our newly acquired crm platform and initial phases of our next generation of our encompass platform we believe our  results are a testament to the strong value proposition we provide in helping lenders achieve loan quality regulatory compliance and operating efficiency we see continued opportunity to expand our market share and make progress on our vision of automating the entire mortgage industry we enter  with a robust business pipeline even after the record setting seat bookings of  our first quarter guidance reflects the seasonal decline in mortgage volumes but we expect strong q seat bookings to drive revenue growth in the coming quarters we remain confident in our ability to grow our business by our target growth rate of plus and have reflected that in our guidance for the full year  with that i will now turn the call over to our cfo ed luce to discuss our results and guidance in more detail ed edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you jonathan good afternoon and thanks again to everyone joining us today as jonathan mentioned we had a great fourth quarter and full year and i am pleased to report the following highlights total revenue for the fourth quarter of  was  million an increase of  from the fourth quarter last year contracted revenue increased  yearoveryear to  million during the quarter contracted revenue represented  of our total revenue we booked  seats in the fourth quarter of these sold  were from new customers as jonathan mentioned  came from addon seats and upgrades totaled  and we again grew our market share during the quarter with total active encompass users increasing  yearoveryear to  we continue to see strong demand across all segments including midmarket large enterprise as well as all lender types including mortgage banks community banks and regional banks active saas encompass users increased  yearoveryear to approximately  and the total number of saas seats under contract increased  yearoveryear to approximately  revenue per active encompass user increased  yearoveryear to  for the quarter because fourth quarter users increased more quickly than fourth quarter revenues we saw a  sequential decline in arpu as we forecasted and discussed in our last earnings call for the full year arpu grew  over  implementation and professional services revenues also increased yearoveryear driven by the booking and onboarding of enterprise lenders during the quarter professional services represented approximately  of revenue and  for the full year  as well cost of revenue for the fourth quarter was  of revenue at  million compared to  or  million in the prior year period this planned increase was due primarily to staff added in the areas of implementation professional services and saas operations in addition to the amortization of internal use software associated with our application enhancement this resulted in gross margin for the quarter of  compared to  in the fourth quarter last year as we continue to invest in technical support data centers and security systems and infrastructure primarily to support the expansion of our enterprise customer base we expect to see gross margins in the mids for the full year  we increased our staff by  people in the fourth quarter mainly in those areas of implementation professional services and research and development our total head count at december  was  an increase of  people over the prior year or nearly  and we expect to reach approximately  employees by the end of  net income for the fourth quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in the fourth quarter  the tax rate came down this quarter as the rd tax credits were reinstated on a retroactive basis so for the year  our effective tax rate was  our projected annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately  for the full year  as well on a nongaap basis adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million and  per diluted share in the fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was  million compared to  million for the fourth quarter  and now turning to our results for the full year  we had a  increase in total revenues to  million compared to  million in  ondemand revenue increased  to  million compared to  million last year this increase was largely a result of the addition of new ondemand encompass saas customers the upgrades of existing customers to our saas platform the ongoing adoption of our standalone products and services the addition of allregs and a  increase in national volumes gross margins for the full year were  compared to  for  this reflects our growth in enterprise investment programs related to client implementation support teams security and data center expansion net income for the full year  was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million and  per diluted share in  on a nongaap basis adjusted net income for the full year was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million and a  per diluted share in  and adjusted ebitda for  was  million  higher than the  million we posted in  shifting to the balance sheet as of december  we have cash and investments totaling  million overall we generated almost  million in cash from operations during the year thats up  from  million in  we invested  million in data center equipment and software and  million in capitalized rd leaving  million of free cash flow we also absorbed  million in acquisition costs related to the mortgage returns crm acquisition and weve returned  million to ellie mae shareholders via stock repurchases during the quarter so despite significant investments made across several key areas of the company during the year we continued to generate significant positive cash flow fourth quarter diluted shares outstanding were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  now before turning to guidance i will note that given our transition to pure saas is expected to be completed in the first half of  with the sunsetting of our legacy licensed software products we plan to consolidate some of the metrics we provide to be more reflective of a  saas model therefore in  we plan to provide the following metrics on a quarterly basis total contracted revenue percent contracted saas revenues revenue per active encompass user and contracted saas users along with total seat bookings we will no longer breakout onpremise revenue because this revenue category becomes immaterial now turning to the guidance our  annual guidance takes into consideration industry forecast for mortgage origination volume we use the composite estimates of mortgage volumes as published by fannie mae freddie mac and the mortgage bankers association to forecast certain portions of our business for the year this composite shows an estimated  decline in origination volumes from  the detailed blended forecast data can be found on our supplemental data sheet thats posted on the investor relations section of our website against this backdrop for the first quarter of  our revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million net income is expected to be  million to  million or  to  per diluted share adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per diluted share and adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of  million to  million for the quarter for the full year total revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per diluted share and adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or a  to a  per diluted share adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of  million to  million and finally before we turn to your questions i would like to mention that we will be hosting an analyst day event in las vegas on march  in conjunction with our annual user conference in addition we will be participating in the morgan stanley technology media  telecom conference in san francisco and the th annual roth conference in laguna niguel both during the month of march more information is available on our website for the experience user conference and forthcoming press announcements will be issued with additional details on the investor conferences and now wed like to open the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator certainly our first question comes from saket kalia with barclays please go ahead saket kalia  barclays capital inc hi guys thanks for taking my questions here nice finish to the year edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi saket jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director hey saket how are you thanks thanks a lot saket kalia  barclays capital inc hey jonathan so lets start on the new seat bookings given the big increase can you just maybe talk about how new products are contributing to that seat count if at all and also whether youre seeing any change competitively thats allowing you to sort of maintain this rate of new seat growth jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director i would just say that from an overall standpoint what is continuing to drive our success in the marketplace is previous success its kind of very much of a virtuous cycle as we become more successful in all the segments whether itd be the enterprise segment the large segment or the midmarket – that continued success is just driving more and more activity more business coming our way the compliance leadership that we have is so critical to the market and they we see continuing to be critical and that is a great tailwind for us and the comprehensive nature of our solutions so the fact that we keep adding to our product footprint and we keep adding to our capabilities of automation very much are bringing customers across the table and that also falls into all categories of lenders not one category so were seeing mortgage banks community banks regional banks – success across the board and we had a wonderful q the team did an amazing job and the pipeline still looks very very robust and we just havent – other competitors are just not keeping up and for the most part we just keep extending our differentiation and our lead and its all been quite a set of results for the team and i see that for the foreseeable future saket kalia  barclays capital inc great great and then maybe moving to the onpremise encompass base that base has shifted to successbased pricing through the year you still have i think about  or  more seats to go from what youve seen so far can you just talk about what sort of retention rate youve seen through the transition so far and also any sort of revenue lift that youve seen from those customers transitioning jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director sure sure so we continue to see momentum there its reflected in some of the upgrades weve seen over the last couple quarters id say that even the active user number that we see out there is a trailing indicator because many of those customers have already i think committed and they are moving over to the hosted saas offering we expect again to see the vast majority of those seats come over every single one will come over but we expect it to be well north of  and id say and we talked about this in the past the beauty of our saas models successbased pricing is that as we shift people from onpremise to this model we are really bringing a tremendous amount of additional value to the customer so bringing the solution to the table additional components of our services that cut across compliance and docs electronic disclosure websites et cetera and with that obviously taking on the responsibility to manage their infrastructure in our data centers providing levels of security et cetera and so typically were seeing an uptick on this that is somewhere between three to four times what we were making from an onpremise customer and the real idea there is that yes were gaining a much bigger wallet share from the customer but when they look at their overall costs when they actually remove some of the costs that they were dealing with prior to moving to the saas model theyre doing better off so its a winwin across the board saket kalia  barclays capital inc got it and if i could sneak in one last housekeeping question ed what was the closed loan per active saas user per month in the quarter edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president it was about  saket kalia  barclays capital inc great thanks very much guys jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director yeah sure operator thank you well go next to ross macmillan with rbc capital markets please go ahead ross macmillan  rbc capital markets llc thanks so much and congrats from me to jonathan ed and the team jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director thanks ross edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks ross ross macmillan  rbc capital markets llc can you just – one thing im curious on is how the revenue per loan trends are tracking i think you talked at analyst day last year about  uplift in the prior two years can you talk about how that trended in  and how do you think that will play out in the year ahead in  edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president the trend should be fairly similar we expect to see and what we have baked into our guidance is continuing growth in that revenue per loan weve certainly been working on the addition as an example of allregs this past year and more recently on the mortgage returns crm which will help increase that number in  jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director and the other thing that continues to drive that is just this continued adoption across the industry in terms of doing things electronically so kind of the tide rising where more and more categories of services – obviously credit and flood and some of the others that have been highly adopted other categories appraisal title different types of verification services et cetera just continue on their trajectory kind of like the tide is rising and being a big ship on that tide were benefiting so that just continues to grow every month every quarter and that contributes to that revenue per loan growth as well ross macmillan  rbc capital markets llc so consistent in that  type of range is the way we should think about that is that a fair statement jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director yeah thats fair edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah we think its reasonable ross macmillan  rbc capital markets llc okay thats great and then one of the fears has been that post the respatila deadline that we would see some slowdown in new seat bookings and of course youve been vocal that that was not happening and youve been very vocal about the pipeline can you just maybe frame less about the conversions from out of the base and more about either new customers or existing addons now that were past respatila what is the sort of real driver for that now is it other regulatory events on the horizon or is it that there was a lot of bandaiding to get compliant to respatila and now there are real platform decisions maybe that still need to be made i thought to get color jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director i think theres a couple of things one obviously you saw q nearly  new seats just way beyond anything weve done in the past which is again just showing the momentum is – respatila happened before that what were seeing is ongoing demand from the market as weve gained more success as they see clearly were the market leader as they are – their mindset is more and more automation because it really has compliance and quality demands have gotten them to a place where its not a nicetohave its a necessity those are all what drove the benefit in q and what is feeding our pipeline as we come into  there is a lot of compliance that is going to keep coming or agency changes so were going to see things from the home mortgage disclosure act that will hit in the back half of  into  theres going to be major changes that come from fannie and freddie in terms of the loan applications those are the major things and then theres always a bunch of other things weve been there so theres this underlying kind of continued shift of demands from the industry on regulation and agency but there is this broad just movement and were seeing it accelerate to just embrace automation and pushing more and more capability to the consumer who wants to do more on a selfservice fashion and so thats really whats going on its this kind of combinations of success breeding success of success in different segments breeding more success and then the ongoing feeling that for the customers that didnt make the move this year already feeling the pain and our phones really ringing off the hook to talk with us and figure out how they can embrace encompass and automate and remove some of the human spackle theyve thrown at the problem to fill the cracks in the shortterm ross macmillan  rbc capital markets llc thats great maybe one quick one for ed just historically youve talked about exiting  at around your target ebitda range is that still very much in your line of sight right now are you still thinking that exiting  youll be at roughly your target ebitda margin edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah absolutely you may even see us hit those targets later this year second quarter third quarter is usually our strongest period but for the year exiting  we should have those – we should be right up against it ross macmillan  rbc capital markets llc thanks so much congrats edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you well go next to brian schwartz with oppenheimer please go ahead brian schwartz  oppenheimer  co inc broker hi thank you for taking my questions this afternoon and i too add my congratulations on the terrific year for you guys jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director thanks brian brian schwartz  oppenheimer  co inc broker i just have one question jonathan i kind of want to put  behind and my question is really on the year ahead and specifically whats going on in the environment here in the us and relating to the operating model pressures that the banks are currently under right now i think in your introductory comments you talked about operational efficiency as one of the growth drivers for the business and if we think about whats happened since the start of this year there was a clear consensus expectation that the banks would be seeing substantial new revenues from the higher net interest margins and unfortunately we all know now that new revenue source for the banks is unlikely to develop anytime soon just wondering is the readthrough of interest rates not rising as fast as everyone expected that the banks will be forced to quickly look at software solutions for cost savings to bring their operating models in line with last net interest revenues which for your business could end up accentuating the operational efficiency spending driver in the end market as we work our way through  curious to get your thoughts on that development thanks jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director brian that is an excellent point and i do think that the environment as were now seeing it is further accentuated there weve already seen weve talked about how costs have gone up dramatically over the last four or five years based on all the demands from compliance and regulation and those costs have more than doubled to get a loan done for a consumer and so theyre already embracing automation i think the fact that there is more squeeze in terms of profitability makes it even that much more attractive to embrace software solutions like ours to automate and take out as much inefficiency as they possibly can so i think that that is a very good thesis brian schwartz  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you operator thank you well go next to richard baldry with roth capital partners please go ahead richard kenneth baldry  roth capital partners llc thanks looking longer term is it possible we could actually see your revenue growth somewhat disconnect from either  arpu growth and what im thinking is the biggest banks to me seemed at risk of falling behind the compliant side of the table with so many changing regulations and youre providing those kind of services coming at something like   seats which the cost to build versus outsource starts to favor you guys so could you see strategic deals someday where they arent buying sort of your traditional seat but maybe doing more of the strategic deal only on something like a compliance product or is that really not a model youd want to pursue jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director no i think richard youre absolutely correct it actually is something that we are doing to some extent right now so our compliance engine although its embedded in encompass and all our customers take advantage of it we also sell it under the mavent brand and there are a number of the largest lenders and investors in the country leveraging it right now thats also true of some of the things weve done around some of the allregs solutions and clearly our goal is to get everybody on to encompass but we have – we use hooks or entry points with some of the largest investors as well and i can see more and more of that i think its a great point and were already doing a bit of that today richard kenneth baldry  roth capital partners llc okay and it was nice to see the more aggressive push on the buyback in a pretty weak market so maybe from an overall perspective could you talk about just thoughts on how to pursue that in a down market whether that would be something youd really look at using it from a free cash flow and maintain the balance sheet where it is or maybe conversely be willing to put some of – more of the balance sheet to work on that avenue kind of given the visibility youve got longterm into the cash flows youve got to sort of depend that balance sheet over time edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president rich as you know we have a lot of options with this balance sheet there is no debt on the balance sheet right now were generating good cash every quarter so weve got a lot of options open as far as how we do that jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director and again i think the stock buyback we did in q is a reflection of where we saw the stock and kind of what value we saw and the value of the current shares and we took that as an opportunity but more broadly we obviously have been very acquisitive over the years were always looking at opportunity strategically and we want to make sure we have that available at our – quickly if the opportunities come up so we obviously are in a nice situation where we can look at all the adoptions and to see how to best grow the company and deliver value to the shareholders richard kenneth baldry  roth capital partners llc and the last one within that new seat bookings total because it was startlingly high was it a broadbased stepup in the number of deals or were there some very significant sort of oneoff deals that maybe – or small handfuls that really influenced that number what would help us maybe understand the repeatability of that or how much it might have been a onetime outlier or not thanks jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director there was still strength across all the segments on that some good solid deals in the enterprise segment that were at the thousands seat level small handful there lots of deals in the large segment and the midmarket and i think that again it was a very strong quarter but the pipeline looks very robust and i think well continue to see that no one big deal that really brought that in it was just a great performance across the board and good solid deals across each of the segments richard kenneth baldry  roth capital partners llc okay thanks jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director thanks rich operator thank you well go next to brandon dobell with william blair please go ahead brandon b dobell  william blair  co llc hey afternoon guys jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director hey brandon edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi brandon brandon b dobell  william blair  co llc maybe jonathan you kind of touched on it earlier but i guess some color on how you think about lets call it top  lender market share in   versus what has been the past couple of years do you think they keep ceding share do you see the recent trends reverse and theyre trying to grab some share and i know the mix of your volume is going to be different than what the market shows but as you think about the big buckets of lender groups how do you think about share shifts the next couple of years jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director well i think well continue to see penetration across all the channels as weve said in the past and obviously on our investor deck we have at least one channel in seven of the top  so we have an entry point there there is overall trend as you just mentioned the very top lenders are seeing a shift away from them in terms of retail origination volume and its been pretty steady over the last few years i dont know if that continues or not but again our efforts cut across all the segments weve seen great growth in all the segments and i dont foresee that changing anytime soon brandon b dobell  william blair  co llc okay and then as you think about the directtoconsumer channel opportunity any sense of what the contributions from that other from the bookings perspective or revenue perspective should look like in  jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director i really dont know in terms of particular details brandon across the board what were seeing is that more and more lenders want to extend capabilities to their consumer in a self service basis for parts of the process and theyre not looking to completely change their process but rather respond to the needs of different consumers based on how much theyre willing to perhaps do on their own but almost in all cases you really see this combination of what ill call high tech and high touch so it really is still a combination and i dont think thats going to change anytime soon of consumers wanting to do some themselves but expecting a lender to help them in part of that process because it is such a big transaction that happens so infrequently and lenders really adapting to that so we look at it as just another extension of the capabilities we provide our lenders to best provide the kind of service the kind of capabilities their borrowers want brandon b dobell  william blair  co llc okay and then final one from me maybe ed if you look at the customer list maybe give us a range or just maybe what the top couple of deciles in terms of what the customers are doing from a closed loan per month you mentioned that  figure do you have people out there doing three loans per user per month is it five loans i guess im trying to get a figure or an idea of how much or more headroom you have on that lets call it productivity per user curve jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director in the top quartile youve got folks that somewhere between three and four loans per user per month so its a fairly broad distribution as folks are adopting the technology and moving up the curve but also some of its reflective of how well an operator the lender is so that gives you some sense brandon b dobell  william blair  co llc okay great thanks appreciate it jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director sure edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks brandon operator thank you well go next to john campbell with stephens please go ahead john campbell  stephens inc hey guys congrats on a great quarter and congrats for the sales teams for driving that impressive net new logo cclip  edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks john jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director thanks john john campbell  stephens inc yeah absolutely on guidance you guys obviously have really good visibility into the revenue trends but just curious have you guys stresstest the guidance or running scenarios  kind of different origination markets in  like how low origination market would you have to encounter this year to maybe go below the low end of your range edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president we do our stress tests all the time frankly we would have to get to almost ridiculous level of volumes out there to drop down that low john youre talking well below  trillion worth of volume john campbell  stephens inc great thats good to hear and then on the head count you guys have obviously ramped organic head count a good bet  and then youve got the acquired heads coming in and – i might have missed this but im assuming you guys probably got to your orso head count target but just curious a is that right and then b maybe what your plans are from the near to mediumterm are you close to where you need to be jonathan h corr  president chief executive officer  director we finished the year a little shy of the  with the acquisition we did and obviously last year was a very robust year in terms of investment were still investing this year but at a little bit more modest pace i would expect that well finish the year probably right around  folks john campbell  stephens inc got it okay thats helpful and then as we think about again the commentary around the kind of target model hitting that  to  margin in  i would assume maybe its just kind of moderate paceup from there just given your cost base is still fixed is that kind of how you achieve that margin lift into  edgar a luce  chief financial officer  executive vice president well yes but specifically this very intensive investment program that weve been – that weve had underway for about a year and a half now thats already starting to taper off and it really really tapers after this quarter in fact so the rest of this year and beyond we expect to be on
