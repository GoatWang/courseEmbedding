operations and business with and through our wholly owned subsidiaries a win global markets inc israel ltd an israeli company b wgm services ltd a company registered in cyprus “wgm” c ez invest securities ltd a japanese corporation and d scgp investments limited a belizean company we have developed and currently operate an online trading platform for retail customers to trade a wide range of binary options internationally with more than  different assets including indices international stocks commodities and currency pairs “trading platform” the trading platform enables retail customers to trade binary options in more than  countries it is accessible from multiple operating systems windows smartphones ios and android and tablets and the internet the trading platform has been selfdeveloped and is proprietary the trading platform has been designed to be as intuitive and as easy to use as possible the trading platform has been localized into multiple languages in june  the cyprus securities and exchange commission “cysec” authorized us to freely provide our services in all european union “eu” member states where cysec has informed each countrys competent authority as a result we now operate in austria bulgaria croatia czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary iceland italy ireland latvia liechtenstein lithuania luxembourg malta netherlands norway poland portugal romania slovak republic slovenia spain sweden and the united kingdom to comply with united states federal securities laws and us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” regulations we prohibit us and canadian persons from using our trading platform we utilize geotargeting which is the method of determining the country of the website visitor based on his or her address even if the website visitor uses a virtual private network or some other method of internet protocol which will prevent us from correctly identifying his or her country we have additional layers of security in the form of credit cardbank account identification proof of address such as a current utility bill and copies of a passport from each potential user to further ensure that he or she does not reside in the united states the binary options market a binary option is a type of option where the payoff is straightforward – it pays back either some fixed amount of a trade or nothing at all the two main types of binary options are the cashornothing binary option and the assetornothing binary option the cashornothing binary option pays some fixed amount of cash if the option expires “inthemoney” while the assetornothing pays the value of the underlying security thus the options are binary in nature because there are only two possible outcomes they are also called allornothing options digital options and fixed return options a binary option is an option with a predetermined expiration time at the expiration of the option period the customer either wins or loses there is no automatic exercise feature since the options are of binary nature and the customer does not end up with a position in the underlying asset once a customer enters into a contract neither we nor the customer can change the contract unlike “regular” options that are offered by different exchanges and which are contracts where the customer pays for the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a given price an online binary option is a contract where the customer pays for the right to receive a fixed return in case the price of the underlying asset ends up higher or lower than the strike price the fixed return is attached to a particular asset and the customer has the ability to see the potential payout prior to entering into a certain option contract the customer does not have the ability to determine the percentage of return on such contract however the customer sees the exact payout ratio via the trading platform we intend to grow our customer base further and increase the proportion of customers who trade frequently and for a longer period of time resulting in an increase in the number of trades executed on the trading platform we intend to do this by increasing brand awareness and business intelligence and attracting more customers in regulated markets to and retaining more customers on the trading platform we believe that increased brand awareness with business intelligence will generate greater average deposit per user “adpu” by improving our perception by customers and hence willingness to trade on the trading platform with greater frequency and in greater quantum we believe that increased brand awareness alongside with deep business intelligence has the potential to improve the margin between adpu and average user acquisition cost “auac” we also intend to increase our customer base through entry into new markets where appropriate we will also consider setting up local offices or subsidiaries in such markets and to extend our product and technology offering we intend to further update the number of financial assets offered for binary options trading on the trading platform we believe that by adjusting the product portfolio we will attract more relevant customers to the trading platform resulting in a variety of trading activity we have extended our trading platform and it is now available on many leading mobile devices we strongly believe that our ability to deliver the most advanced and reliable mobile platform will enable us to continue to have a leading position in the market place     view company supplier view

seethruequity we are initiating coverage with a month price target of  per shareadditional highlights from the report are as followspure play on burgeoning binary options marketin our view eztd is an intriguing pure play on the burgeoning online market for binary options trading binary options are options contracts usually call or put contracts in which the payouts depend entirely upon the outcome of a yes  no proposition the yes  no proposition typically relates to whether the price of an asset that underlies a binary option will rise above or fall below a specified amount by a predetermined expiration time through subsidiary companies incorporated in tel aviv israel and nicosia cyprus eztd has  employees and operates three main online brands – eztradercom globaloptioncom ezinvestcom  which provide secure regulated online trading platform for binary options trading eztds brands utilize the companys proprietary selfdeveloped technology to provide a comprehensive binary option trading for retail customers the product can be accessed  and real time pricing and a sophisticated intuitive backoffice tool for account monitoring that extends across a number of device types to enable binary options trading on more than  assets including commodities currency pairs indexes and stocksstrong revenue trends buoyed by growth in users and volumewe see eztd as an online growth company in which the key to generating longterm robust free cash flow is to achieve a critical mass of users and trading volume such that the company is established as a premier online provider of binary options trading given that the binary options market appears to be in the early stages of growth and is fragmented in our opinion the best way to gauge eztds progress towards this goal is to monitor active users volume on the eztd platform and revenue for the first three quarters of the year eztds volume rose by  to reach mn while revenues climbed  to mn at the end of the september quarter eztd had  active customers up significantly from  during  these impressive growth figures support the companys claim that it is emerging as a leading player in the online binary options
