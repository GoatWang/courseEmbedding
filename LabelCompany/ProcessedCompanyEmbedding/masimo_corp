pulse oximetry technologies the masimo radical is a pulse oximeter that can also noninvasively measure a patients hemoglobin and respiration rate masimo set adhesive sensors monitor oxygenation pulse rate and special rainbow sensors allow additional measurement of noninvasive blood constituents pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes leds one red and one infrared to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen which is called arterial oxygen saturation spo conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving pulsating in the measurement site however during patient motion the venous blood also moves which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to underread spo levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood set identifies the venous blood signal which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood isolates it and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate spo and pulse rate in addition set pulse oximetry provides perfusion index pi and pleth variability index pvi multiple studies have shown that compared to nonset pulse oximeters set increases the ability to detect lifethreatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions additional studies have also shown the impact of set on patient outcomes such as helping clinicians decrease retinopathy of prematurity rop in neonates increase detection of critical congenital heart disease cchd in newborns reduce ventilator weaning time by titrating fio faster and reduce arterial blood gas measurements in the intensive care unit icu decrease rapid response activations and intensive care unit icu transfers to save lives and costs in postsurgical patients on the medicalsurgical floors through earlier identification of patients in distress through low spo and abnormal pulse rate measurements decrease fluid administered during surgery and reduce patient risk in  the american academy of pediatrics and the us department of health and human services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns using motiontolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions to make this recommendation the cchd workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used set pulse oximetry to assess newborns in  masimo received fda k clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for cchd it marked the first time the fda cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters in conjunction with a physical examination to screen newborns for cchd in  the national health service nhs technology adoption centre in the united kingdom advised hospitals to use intraoperative fluid management technologies as a way to improve patient outcomes and included masimos pvi among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries in  the french society for anaesthesia and intensive care sfar added pvi to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients rainbow pulse cooximetryedit rainbow pulse cooximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin sphb carboxyhemoglobin spco and methemoglobin spmet in addition to oxygen saturation spo pulse rate perfusion index pi and pleth variability index pvi a study at massachusetts general hospital showed that sphb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from  to  another study from cairo university showed that sphb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of  units per patient emergency department studies have shown that spco helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide co poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods the pronto device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin along with spo and pulse rate has been recognized with a gold medical design excellence award the world health organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an innovative medical technology for costeffectively addressing global health concerns and needs in october  masimo announced ce mark of oxygen reserve index or ori the company’s th noninvasive parameter which provides realtime visibility to oxygenation status ori is intended to supplement not replace oxygen saturation spo monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen pao measurements ori can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia noninvasive patient monitoringedit patient safetynetedit patient safetynet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medicalsurgical care floors a large study by dartmouthhitchcock medical center showed patient safetynet helped clinicians achieve a  reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a  decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units icu yielding a savings of  intensive care unit icu days annually for an annual opportunitycost savings of  million ecri institute gave dartmouth its health devices achievement award for its use of patient safetynet to prevent severe patient harm masimo has introduced halo index in the patient safetynet system combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status rainbow acoustic monitoringedit rainbow acoustic monitoring provides noninvasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patients neck researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate rra and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods endtidal carbon dioxide etco and impedance pneumography sedline brain function monitoringedit in  masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brains electrical activity eeg studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care capnography and gas monitoringedit in  masimo began offering ultracompact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for endtidal carbon dioxide co nitrous oxide no oxygen o and anesthetic agents for use in the operating room procedural sedation and in intensive care units icu a multicenter study at cincinnati childrens hospital medical center university medical center tucson arizona and childrens medical center dallas found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography the current
