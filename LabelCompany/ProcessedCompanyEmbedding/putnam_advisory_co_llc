negligent misrepresentation and negligence claiming that putnam misrepresented its management of a collateralized debt obligation called pyxis to induce fgic to provide financial guaranty insurance for pyxis according to fgic’s complaint putnam stated that it would select the collateral for pyxis independently and in the interests of long investors ie investors who profit when the investment

financial guaranty insurance for pyxis according to fgic’s complaint putnam stated that it would select the collateral for pyxis independently and in the interests of long investors ie investors who

proceedings background the allegations contained in fgic’s complaint have been comprehensively set forth in the district court’s opinion below see fgic  wl  at   we nevertheless provide a brief recitation of the most pertinent factual allegations which are  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co presumed to be true for purposes of considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim i the pyxis cdo this case arises out of putnam’s role as collateral manager of the pyxis cdo a cdo is a special purpose vehicle that purchases or assumes the risk of a portfolio of assets to buy their portfolio of assets cdos raise money from investors by issuing notes and equity interests the assets that comprise the cdo generate cash which is then paid out to the cdo’s investors investors in a cdo are not necessarily all subject to the same level of risk rather cdo notes may be issued in “tranches” representing different levels of risk and potential reward generally senior tranches carry the lowest risk whereas investors in the equity tranche assume the greatest risk in the event of a default pyxis was a “hybrid” cdo in that its  billion portfolio included both “cash” assets ie assets that pyxis actually purchased and “synthetic” assets ie assets created through  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co transactions that referenced securities not actually owned by pyxis about  of pyxis’s assets were cash assets and  were synthetic assets created by credit default swaps that referenced other asset backed securities in these credit default swaps pyxis sold credit protection to counterparties in exchange for premium payments to pyxis if the assets referenced in the swaps performed well pyxis would enjoy the premium payments without having to make credit protection payments if the assets performed poorly however pyxis would have to make credit protection payments to the credit default swap counterparty potentially up to the full notional amount of the referenced obligation calyon corporate and investment bank “calyon” the structuring bank for pyxis paid premiums to pyxis under a credit a bank structuring a cdo transaction is responsible for financing and facilitating the purchase of the cdo’s assets constructing the cdo and interacting with rating agencies see loreley fin jersey no  ltd v credit agricole corporate and inv bank index no  ny sup ct june   ja     fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co default swap in exchange for protection payments in the event that a portfolio asset experienced a “credit event” such as a default or failure to pay a defined obligation for most of the specified assets calyon acted only as an intermediary meaning that the ultimate short positions were held by other market participants ii putnam’s representations and the pyxis guaranty in july  calyon contacted fgic to solicit credit protection for the pyxis cdo under the deal that calyon proposed to fgic fgic was to insure all payments owed by its subsidiary fgic credit products llc under a credit default swap which would provide credit protection on the  million “super senior” pyxis tranche “the pyxis guaranty” without the pyxis guaranty pyxis would not have closed calyon represented that the cdo would be managed by putnam which would select the pyxis asset portfolio independently in good faith and in the best interests of the investors  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co fgic alleges that it and investors were heavily dependent on putnam’s experience independence and integrity as collateral manager putnam represented to fgic orally and in writing that it was an experienced and reputable collateral manager and that it would select the assets for the pyxis portfolio diligently and independently putnam provided documents such as a  page marketing pitchbook and an offering memorandum containing extensive representations about putnam’s role as a “global leader in asset management” and the rigorous selection process by which it would select the assets for the pyxis portfolio sac ¶¶     ja   putnam made similar representations to fgic in the course of fgic’s extensive due diligence for pyxis which included an on site review of putnam’s operations at putnam’s boston offices during a face to face meeting of representatives from fgic and putnam putnam represented that it would select and manage the  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co assets in the pyxis portfolio and described in detail its expertise and strategy for doing so in a follow up call putnam again made clear that it would select and manage the assets for pyxis and that it had considerable experience in the residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” market particularly in the market for subprime rmbs of which the pyxis portfolio would primarily be composed putnam represented that it performed extensive due diligence with respect to prospective rmbs investments including conducting on site visits to most of the servicers of the loans underlying these investments and more importantly that it maintained ongoing interactions with all servicers to keep tabs on their servicing strategy and performance id as a result of these representations fgic provided the pyxis guaranty iii magnetar’s alleged scheme fgic contends that contrary to its representations putnam abdicated control of the selection of pyxis’s assets to magnetar a hedge fund that had a financial interest in pyxis’s failure  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co according to the sac in early  the hedge fund magnetar worked with collateral managers to launch a series of cdos by supplying the funds for the equity tranche the riskiest stake magnetar made it possible to secure investors and insurers like fgic willing to take long positions in those cdos but unlike an ordinary investor magnetar purchased the equity tranche of pyxis and other similar cdos not because it thought the cdo was a sound investment but because the investment permitted magnetar to simultaneously bet against the more senior tranches in the same deal these short positions were much greater often six to one than magnetar’s long equity position in other words magnetar stood to gain significantly more if the cdo failed than if it succeeded as collateral manager of pyxis putnam was responsible for selecting the assets for inclusion in the portfolio monitoring the credit status of the underlying assets reinvesting payment proceeds  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co from maturing assets and making substitutions in the portfolio of assets but according to the sac putnam was well aware of magnetar’s “hedged equity” strategy of betting against the assets included or referenced in pyxis and putnam allowed magnetar to secretly control the composition of those assets fgic alleges that magnetar made a “behind the scenes” arrangement with calyon of which putnam was aware requiring calyon or putnam to notify magnetar of any proposed acquisition for the pyxis portfolio and giving magnetar veto rights over any such proposed acquisition sac ¶  ja  magnetar also designated which collateral it wanted to include in the pyxis portfolio which putnam accommodated for example the sac alleges that in july  james prusko of magnetar emailed carl bell at putnam to suggest that putnam increase the synthetic portion of pyxis by entering into more credit default swaps referencing low rated rmbs which would allow magnetar to short more of the pyxis assets prusko  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co explained that it was “very hard to get off sizable cdo cds trades unless they’re done against a deal and this is a natural delta hedge against our equity” bell wrote back “got it so when we find a deal we want to buy we shouldn’t put in an order with the syndicate desk but have calyon broker a synthetic trade between you and pyxis at an agreed upon level” prusko replied “that would be preferable    ” sac ¶  alteration in complaint ja  fgic alleges that magnetar’s long position on pyxis by the time pyxis defaulted was approximately  million magnetar’s short position on the cdos in which it invested averaged approximately  of the aggregate assets of those cdos if pyxis were an average magnetar cdo therefore magnetar’s short position on pyxis a  billion cdo would have totaled  million  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co for its role in cooperating with magnetar’s scheme putnam received a fixed fee of fifteen basis points ie  of the outstanding principal of pyxis each year and an additional “incentive” fee of five basis points due to pyxis’s size this was a substantial sum putnam’s fixed fee was  million for the first year alone and by  putnam had received cumulative total fees of  the sac also alleges that putnam saw pyxis as an opportunity to “establish a foothold in the market” for managing similar cdos in the future sac ¶¶   ja   indeed putnam was selected by magnetar to serve as collateral manager for a second pyxis cdo pyxis abs cdo – which closed a few months after pyxis iv magnetar’s control over the pyxis portfolio and pyxis’s default fgic alleges that the assets magnetar directed putnam to include in the pyxis portfolio were on their face more likely to default than the assets putnam would have selected had it acted  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co independently putnam invested half of pyxis’s cash allocated to cdo investments in four other magnetar cdos even though there were over two hundred asset backed cdos issued in  alone in which putnam could have invested according to the sac putnam concealed the extent to which pyxis sold protection on the abx index of low rated rmbs the abs index is an independent benchmark designed to measure the overall value of mortgages made to borrowers with subprime or weak credit magnetar pushed putnam to circumvent the limit represented to pyxis investors on investment in the abx index to a level more than three times the specified concentration limit which increased the risk profile of the pyxis portfolio putnam also provided fgic with a “target portfolio” for pyxis that included  million of prime rmbs but then without alerting fgic replaced all of the prime rmbs with subprime rmbs which were more likely to default  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co on april   only eighteen months after pyxis closed fitch ratings ltd downgraded the credit rating of the pyxis super senior tranche from aaa to c ultimately pyxis defaulted and fgic incurred liability of up to  million under the pyxis guaranty v proceedings in the district court fgic sued putnam for fraud negligent misrepresentation and negligence after fgic filed the sac putnam moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim the district court granted putnam’s motion to dismiss the district court held that fgic had failed to state a claim for fraud because the sac did not contain sufficient allegations to plausibly indicate that “magnetar’s alleged control of the collateral selection process for pyxis caused fgic’s losses as opposed to the global financial crisis” fgic  wl  at  the district court also dismissed fgic’s negligent misrepresentation and negligence claims on the ground that the sac did not contain allegations sufficient to establish a  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co “special relationship” between fgic and putnam id at  putnam timely appealed discussion we review de novo a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim “accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff’s favor” walker v schult  fd   d cir  “to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter accepted as true to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face” ashcroft v iqbal  us    internal quotation marks omitted to state a plausible claim the complaint’s “factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level” bell atl corp v twombly  us    we begin by rejecting putnam’s argument raised for the first time on appeal that fgic lacks standing to sue putnam contends that fgic did not allege a cognizable injury in fact this point  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co merits little discussion because “at the pleading stage general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice” to establish standing lujan v defenders of wildlife  us    see baur v veneman  fd   d cir  “at the pleading stage standing allegations need not be crafted with precise detail nor must the plaintiff prove his allegations of injury” fgic satisfies this requirement by alleging that it “was required to pay out a huge sum” pursuant to its insurance policy and that it “lost millions” as a result of pyxis’s default sac ¶¶   ja   fgic therefore has standing to bring this action fgic challenges the dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a claim with respect to its fraud claim fgic contends that it alleged facts sufficient to establish loss causation fgic argues in the alternative that it is not required to plead loss causation under new york law because  it is seeking rescission based on fraud and  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co  new york insurance law §  does not require an insurer to establish loss causation in a claim for fraud in the inducement of an insurance contract fgic also argues that the district court erred in dismissing its negligent misrepresentation and negligence claims for failure to sufficiently allege a special relationship between it and putnam we agree with fgic that even if loss causation must be pleaded its allegations are sufficient to state claims for fraud negligent misrepresentation and negligence we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court i fraud claim to state a claim for fraud under new york law a plaintiff must allege  a material misrepresentation or omission of fact  which the defendant knew to be false  which the defendant made with the intent to defraud  upon which the plaintiff reasonably relied and  which caused injury to the plaintiff see crigger v fahnestock  co  fd   d cir  wynn v  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co ac rochester  fd   d cir  per curiam on this appeal we primarily focus on the fifth element causation to satisfy that element a plaintiff must allege both that the “defendant’s misrepresentation induced plaintiff to engage in the transaction in question transaction causation and that the misrepresentations directly caused the loss about which plaintiff complains loss causation” laub v faessel  nysd   st dep’t  citations omitted see eg amusement indus inc v stern  f supp d   sdny  applying new york law there is no dispute here that fgic has sufficiently pleaded transaction causation as the sac contains repeated allegations that but for putnam’s fraudulent misrepresentations fgic would not have entered into the transaction see eg sac ¶  ja  “had fgic known the truth about pyxis    it would never have agreed to issue the pyxis guaranty”  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co loss causation on the other hand “is the causal link between the alleged misconduct and the economic harm ultimately suffered by the plaintiff” lentell v merrill lynch  co  fd   d cir quoting emergent capital inv mgmt llc v stonepath grp inc  fd   d cir  internal quotation marks omitted cert denied  us   to plead loss causation fgic must allege that the “subject of the fraudulent statement or omission was the cause of the actual loss suffered” id at  emphasis omitted quoting suez equity investors lp v toronto dominion bank  fd   d cir  see laub  nysd at  explaining that loss causation is the “fundamental core of the common law concept of proximate cause” a sufficiency of loss causation allegations a claim for common law fraud is subject to the particularity pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b “which requires that the plaintiff  detail the statements or omissions that the plaintiff contends are fraudulent  identify the  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co speaker  state where and when the statements or omissions were made and  explain why the statements or omissions are fraudulent” eternity global master fund ltd v morgan guar trust co of ny  fd   d cir  internal quotation marks omitted the district court did not apply the heightened pleading standards of rule b to fgic’s loss causation allegations but on appeal putnam argues that rule b should apply we have not yet resolved whether allegations as to loss causation must be pleaded with the specificity required by rule b acticon ag v china n e petrol holdings ltd  fd  – d cir  see dura pharm inc v broudo  us    assuming but not deciding that loss causation allegations are governed by ordinary notice pleading standards we need not decide the question today because we find that fgic’s loss causation allegations are sufficient even under the heightened pleading standards of rule b fgic has alleged  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co particular facts that when considered as a whole plausibly allege that putnam’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions caused at least some of the economic harm it suffered these allegations include that had putnam selected the pyxis collateral itself as it represented it would do and had it not acquiesced in magnetar’s control of collateral selection pyxis would not have defaulted as quickly as it did and may well not have defaulted at all at a minimum any losses incurred by pyxis would have been substantially smaller than they were thus fgic’s liability for losses incurred by pyxis would either not have been incurred at all or would have been substantially smaller the purpose of magnetar’s control of the collateral selection process was to ensure that the assets selected for inclusion in the pyxis portfolio would be likely to default many of the assets selected for the pyxis portfolio by magnetar on their face were more liable to default than the assets putnam would have selected had it acted independently for example putnam’s original target portfolio for pyxis included  million of prime rmbs at magnetar’s direction putnam replaced these assets in the final portfolio with  million of subprime rmbs the magnetar selected assets in the pyxis portfolio defaulted more quickly than other assets in the pyxis portfolio based on a preliminary analysis of the  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co performance of assets in the pyxis portfolio for which fgic has evidence that magnetar directed selection all magnetar selected assets had defaulted by march  and their average life before default was just  years by contrast the average life before default of the pyxis collateral for which fgic does not have direct evidence of magnetar’s control was  years in general magnetar’s cdos defaulted in greater numbers and defaulted much more quickly than comparable cdos as of april  all  of magnetar’s  vintage mezzanine cdos had defaulted while only  of  vintage non magnetar mezzanine cdos had defaulted as of december  when pyxis defaulted  of magnetar’s  vintage mezzanine cdos had defaulted while only  of  vintage non magnetar mezzanine cdos had done so over  million of the magnetar selected assets defaulted before the financial crisis took hold the default of these assets substantially contributed to pyxis’s collapse and to fgic’s losses under the pyxis guaranty at this preliminary stage accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in fgic’s favor the sac alleges a causal connection between putnam’s fraudulent misrepresentations and fgic’s losses under the pyxis guaranty such that fgic “would have been spared all or an ascertainable  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co portion of that loss absent the fraud” lentell  fd at  the district court found the sac’s allegations deficient in part because the “pool of assets alleged to be controlled by magnetar represented roughly  of the  billion collateral pool and the sac does not allege how the selection of safer assets in this  pool would have prevented a default” fgic  wl  at  the district court also determined that fgic’s allegations did not allow for an inference of loss causation because “even if the magnetar selected assets in the pyxis portfolio defaulted more quickly than other assets there is nothing in the sac that alleges that this    was sufficient to cause pyxis to default ahead of any market wide downturn or isolates pyxis’ default in any reasonable manner from the market downturn” id in so concluding however the district court misapplied the standard on a motion to dismiss the purpose of the loss causation element is to require a plaintiff “to provide a defendant with some  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind” not to make a conclusive proof of that causal link dura  us at  see id explaining that the requirement is not intended to “impose a great burden” on a plaintiff at this stage of the proceedings fgic is not required to establish that the collateral it has identified as selected by magnetar was the exclusive cause of its losses rather it need only allege sufficient facts to raise a reasonable inference that magnetar’s overall involvement caused an ascertainable portion of its loss in addition the assets identified in the sac are only those that without the benefit of discovery fgic claims to have evidence that magnetar selected fgic alleges that magnetar exercised control over the entire collateral selection process see eg sac ¶  ja  nor is fgic required to allege that its losses were caused solely by putnam’s misrepresentations to satisfy its but for pleading  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co obligations “of course if the loss was caused by an intervening event here the market downturn    the chain of causation will not have been established but such is a matter of proof at trial and not to be decided on a rule b motion to dismiss” emergent capital  fd at  at this preliminary stage accepting all factual allegations in the sac as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in fgic’s favor fgic has plausibly alleged that putnam’s misrepresentations caused at least some of its losses that pyxis defaulted around the time of a global financial crisis was central to the district court’s loss causation analysis certainly when a “plaintiff’s loss coincides with a marketwide phenomenon causing comparable losses to other investors the prospect that the plaintiff’s loss was caused by the fraud” is lessened see lentell  fd at  we observe that there may be circumstances under which a marketwide economic collapse is itself caused by the conduct alleged to have caused a plaintiff’s loss although the link between any particular defendant’s alleged misconduct and the downturn may be difficult to establish see eg fin crisis inquiry comm’n the financial crisis inquiry report –  concluding that the role of synthetic cdos and distorted incentives of cdo managers and hedge funds “contributed significantly” to the financial crisis permanent subcomm on investigations of the s comm on homeland sec  govt’l affairs th cong wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse  because the sac does not contain factual allegations to this effect we take no view as to whether such circumstances are presented here   fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co b sufficiency of other fraud allegations on appeal putnam asserts other separate grounds on which to affirm the district court’s judgment that the sac fails to allege a strong inference of fraudulent intent and fails to plead an actionable misrepresentation or omission these arguments are meritless and warrant little discussion putnam contends that fgic does not provide a “plausible explanation for why putnam would engage in a billion dollar fraud” brief for defendant appellee at  the sac specifically alleges however that putnam was motivated to cooperate with magnetar’s scheme in exchange for unusually lucrative collateral management fees and additional business see sac ¶¶      ja      although putnam argues that these fees did not provide a financial incentive to commit fraud such an argument raises a factual dispute that is inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co we also reject putnam’s argument that fgic fails to allege an actionable misrepresentation or omission by putnam as described above fgic has alleged that putnam represented that it would select and manage the assets for the pyxis portfolio independently and in the interests of long investors representations that fgic contends were false ii negligence claims fgic also argues that the district court erred in dismissing its negligent misrepresentation and negligence claims for failure to sufficiently allege a special or privity like relationship between fgic and putnam fgic’s negligence based claims require that it establish that putnam owed it a “duty to speak with care” kimmell v schaefer  nyd     under new york law such a duty exists in the commercial context when “the relationship of the parties arising out of contract or otherwise is such that in morals and good conscience the one has the right to rely upon the other for information” id at  quoting int’l prods co v erie rr co   fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co ny    see anschutz corp v merrill lynch  co  fd   d cir  explaining that new york law strictly limits negligent misrepresentation claims to “situations involving actual privity of contract between the parties or a relationship so close as to approach that of privity” internal quotation marks omitted it is undisputed that there was no actual contractual privity between fgic and putnam fgic contends that putnam nevertheless owed it a duty of care under this court’s holding in bayerische landesbank v aladdin capital mgmt llc  fd    d cir  in bayerische we held that an investor in a cdo could bring a negligence action against the defendant cdo manager in the absence of any contractual privity in examining the scope of the “orbit of duty” to third parties we stated that “a plaintiff must establish that  the defendant had awareness that its work was to be used for a particular purpose  there was reliance by a third  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co party known to the defendant in furtherance of that purpose and  there existed some conduct by the defendant linking it to that known third party evincing the defendant’s understanding of the third party’s reliance” id at  citing credit alliance corp v arthur andersen  co  nyd    we reasoned that bayerische had sufficiently alleged that the cdo manager “was aware that its work as portfolio manager would be relied on by bayerische a non party to the contract” and that bayerische had relied on the cdo manager’s representations made during a meeting at the cdo manager’s offices in new york that it would “competently and effectively protect bayerische’s interests” id at  the district court distinguished bayerische finding “the investing relationship” between the cdo manager and the third party notes holder in bayerische to be “much closer in scope and shared goals than the one a guarantor of a transaction has with a  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co cdo manager” fgic  wl  at  we disagree just as in bayerische fgic alleges that putnam repeatedly represented that it would select and manage the assets for the pyxis portfolio independently and in the interests of long investors which were aligned with fgic’s interests before fgic agreed to insure credit protection on pyxis it met with putnam representatives at putnam’s offices in boston fgic alleges that it relied on representations made by putnam in issuing the pyxis guaranty and that without the credit protection it provided pyxis would not have closed we find therefore that the sac plausibly alleges facts evincing putnam’s understanding that fgic would “rely on putnam’s care and competence in managing” the pyxis portfolio bayerische  fd at  further to the extent the district court read bayerische to recognize a special relationship only where “the end and aim” of the transaction was to benefit the plaintiff fgic  wl  at  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co  we here clarify that the “end and aim” language in bayerische is a useful rephrasing of the three elements of the special relationship test but is not an independent requirement see bayerische  fd at  discussing three elements and stating “put another way plaintiff must show that the benefit to the non party was the end and aim of the transaction” internal quotation marks omitted see also sykes v rfd third ave  assocs llc  nyd    discussing three elements for special relationship and omitting mention of “end and aim” the district court also noted that statements in the written materials provided to fgic by putnam “expressly disclaim any creation of a special duty” fgic  wl  at  the pyxis pitchbook states that putnam was not “acting as a financial advisor” or in a “fiduciary capacity” and the pyxis offering memorandum urges investors to “rely on their own examination of the co issuers and the terms of the offering including the merits and  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co risks involved” id these disclaimers do not preclude the finding of a special relationship between fgic and putnam first fgic’s claims are not premised on putnam’s acting as a fiduciary or financial advisor to fgic fgic alleges that putnam fraudulently represented that it would select the collateral for pyxis and that it would do so independently and in good faith as these disclaimers do not disclose the possibility that putnam would cede control of the collateral selection process to other market participants with interests adverse to long investors they “fall well short of tracking the particular misrepresentations alleged” by fgic caiola v citibank na ny  fd   d cir  holding in context of securities fraud claim that general disclaimers did not bar plaintiff from relying on defendant’s oral statements cf hsh nordbank ag v ubs ag  nysd  st dep’t  affirming dismissal of claim where plaintiff alleged defendant bank misrepresented risk involved in transaction but contractual  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co documents were “replete with detailed disclosures” of risks involved and defendant’s conflicts of interest second the disclaimers which urge investors to conduct an “examination” of the terms of the offering only underscore the significance of putnam’s representations within those offering documents which fgic alleges were themselves fraudulent see sac ¶¶   ja  given that a determination of whether a special relationship exists is a “factual inquiry” fgic’s allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss suez  fd at  reversing dismissal of negligent misrepresentation claim where conflict between alleged oral representations and disclaimer could not “be resolved on the pleadings” accordingly we hold fgic has plausibly alleged a special relationship between itself and putnam sufficient to state claims for negligent misrepresentation and negligence  fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co conclusion for the foregoing reasons we vacate the district court’s dismissal of the complaint and remand for further

between fgic and calyon which it argues gave rise to the termination agreement  documents concerning the redacted  documents concerning the redacted and  documents relating to a cdo transaction named havenrock ii a separate fgic transaction in which it used pyxis cdo notes as collateral ds br at  in its opposition brief fgic limits its objections to disclosure of the deed of settlement and documents concerning havenrock ii it contends that the termination agreement and the deed of settlement are unrelated and that the latter document is concerned only with the havenrock ii transaction as to havenrock ii fgic concedes that the cdo referenced pyxis in its portfolio but notes that the havenrock transaction took place mere months after pyxis closed and before fgic became aware of putnams fraud pls opp br at  the parties differ as to whether havenrock is relevant to the damages in this action fgic states that the two matters are entirely separate while putnam cites in its reply brief to two incidents where fgic at least implied that havenrockrelated damages made up part of the relief it is seeking in this action either way no matter when the alleged fraud was discovered fgics decision to increase its exposure to pyxis several months after closing and presumably after conducting due diligence in evaluating a new investment does warrant scrutiny that decision and the data and reasoning that went into it is relevant to the extent and reasonableness of its reliance on putnams representations in its briefing fgic indicated its willingness to turn over documents relating to the havenrock ii transaction to the extent that any    reference pyxis pls opp br at  n this concession is insufficient havenrock documents are subject to discovery if they relate to pyxis or putnam whether or not they reference those terms by name see us bank natl assn v phl variable ins co no  civ   wl  at  sdny apr   as to the deed of settlement although the parties dispute whether it relates to the termination agreement and thus to fgics alleged damages it is fgic as the party resisting discovery that bears the burden of establishing that the document is not relevant see sokol v wyeth inc no  civ   wl  at  sdny aug   because fgic has not carried that burden the deed of settlement must be produced documents relating to fgics portfolios putnam is also seeking documents concerning fgics other cdo and rmbs investments outside of and unrelated to pyxis after fgic objected to these requests as burdensome and overbroad putnam agreed to limit its requests to  a list of all rmbs or abs assetbacked securities cdos to which fgic was exposed from january  through the filing of the sac  documents showing the losses suffered by fgic on those investments and  any memoranda submitted to fgics credit committee structured finance committee or other equivalent committee seeking approval of each such transaction ds br at  putnam argues without citing to any authority in its main brief that these documents bear on fgics sophistication and on whether it blindly relied on putnams representations regarding pyxis id at  putnam also contends in its reply brief that these documents are relevant to loss causation ds reply br at  inquiry into this area is denied because fgics general knowledge of the market is too tenuously related to any plausible defense to be a proper subject of discovery assured guar mun corp v ubs real estate sec inc no  civ   wl  at  sdny nov   fgics decisionmaking regarding cdos that are completely unrelated to pyxis would have limited probative value if any while the documents sought describing cdorelated losses incurred during a period of financial crisis where such losses were rampant are likely to be at least significantly burdensome to produce fgic shall produce to putnam a list of the mortgage and assetbacked cdos to which it was exposed and a goodfaith estimate of the total losses suffered from the area as a whole but no further discovery into unrelated investments will be required at this time fgics economic analysis lastly putnam seeks the production of an economic analysis commissioned by fgic for this litigation although expert reports and other such documents prepared for the purpose of litigation are normally covered by the attorneyclient and work product privileges putnam contends that fgic waived any such protection when it cited to and quoted from the analysis in the sac and when it used the report in its second circuit briefing in paragraph  of the sac fgic declares that it retained a firm of economic analysts to assess the likelihood that a suspicious pattern of referenced securities in pyxis and other related cdos could have occurred by chance rather than by design that paragraph also includes three bulletpointed quotations from the analysis concluding that the pattern may indicate that the portfolio selection by independent portfolio managers was influenced by an external factor that the probability of this happening by chance across independent portfolio managers is less than  in a billion and that the likelihood was similar to that observed in cases involving fraudulent options backdating the analysis was referenced in order to show that the selection of financial instruments in pyxis portfolio was in fact conducted in conjunction with magnetar capital llc magnetar a hedge fund with a short position in pyxis with the goal of having pyxis fail creating a profit for magnetar see id fgic also referred to the report in its briefing before the second circuit both the attorneyclient and work product privileges may be waived if a party puts the privileged communication at issue by relying on it to support a claim or defense koumoulis v independent fin mktg grp inc  frd   edny  fgic has done so here by utilizing the report in the sac and before the second circuit it waived its right to object to disclosure of the reports contents see united states v nobles  us    in re grand jury proceedings  fd   d cir  the court in nobles found it crucial that the party elected to make affirmative use of the report and then shield it from scrutiny in its briefing fgic attempts to rehabilitate the privilege over the report by promising not to utilize the analysis in the future including at trial pls opp br at  it cites to the appellate division first departments holding in mbia insurance corp v countrywide home loans inc  add   st dept  for the proposition that mere reference to a privileged document in a pleading does not amount to a waiver of privilege however that opinion also based its holding on the fact that the party asserting the privilege did not need the privileged materials concerning the review to sustain its causes of action id see also ambac assur corp v dlj mortg capital inc  add   st dept  finding no atissue waiver from use of consultant report where the complaint could stand even if all references to it were stricken viewed under that standard the reference to the analysis in fgics complaint standing alone does not constitute a waiver however by referring to the analysis during the second circuits review of this courts decision on the motion to dismiss — in which the circuit determined that fgics allegations were sufficient to state claims for fraud negligent misrepresentation and negligence fgic  fd at  — fgic has already used the report to sustain its causes of action rendering mbia distinguishable since fgic injected the contents of a privileged communication into the litigation by utilizing it in connection with a dispositive motion the at issue waiver applies see ja apparel corp v abboud no  civ   wl  at  sdny jan   rls assocs llc v united bank of kuwait plc no  civ   wl  at  sdny mar   having determined that there was a waiver it is necessary to determine its scope in its motion to compel putnam is seeking all documents concerning the economic consultant analysis including  any reports  any documents provided to the consultants in preparation for the reports  any communications between fgic its lawyers and the consultants and  documents sufficient to identify the consultants and their qualifications ds br at   n the determination of the scope of a waiver of the attorneyclient and workproduct privileges lies within the sound discretion of the district court convole inc v compaq computer corp no  civ   wl  at  sdny sept   here the scope of the waiver should be drawn narrowly under federal rule of evidence a a disclosure of privileged information only extends to undisclosed materials if  the waiver was intentional  the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter and  they ought in fairness to be considered together the  advisory committee notes to rule  provide further guidance explaining that a voluntary disclosure generally results in a waiver only of the communication or information disclosed a subject matter waiver  is reserved for those unusual situations in which fairness requires a further disclosure of related protected information in order to prevent a selective and misleading presentation of evidence to the disadvantage of the adversary these considerations are not present here although fgic may have put the analysis itself at issue by utilizing it in litigation there is no indication that its disclosure was done in an incomplete manipulative or misleading manner and none of the ancillary documents that putnam seeks were utilized in the sac or before the second circuit fgic is therefore only required to produce the analysis document referred to in the sac conclusion putnams motion to compel is granted in part and denied in part as set forth above it is so ordered footnotes  calyon then passed its short position the ability to profit if pyxis did poorly on to other parties see id  although fgic did not directly cite to paragraph  of the sac in its second circuit briefing it does repeatedly assert that it had independently confirmed without discovery that pyxis collateral was not selected independently but rather for magnetars benefit a clear reference to the economic analysis see eg fgic app br decl of thomas a arena dkt no  ex  at  the briefing also cites paragraph  of the sac which also references the analysis id at   fgic contends that its discussion of the economic analysis in its appellate papers should carry no weight because the analysis played no role in the circuits decision while judge straubs opinion does not directly cite any of the sac paragraphs that reference the analysis it does extensively discuss fgics allegations that putnams selection of the pyxis collateral was not independent and conducted in favor of magnetar an assertion that the analysis was conducted to support see fgic  fd at   in its discussion of at issue waiver fgic cites to only one case in which the party resisting discovery used privileged material in connection with a dispositive motion as opposed to merely in a pleading that case mass mut life ins co v merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc  frd  d mass  was decided under massachusetts law id at  although it did extensively analyze several new york cases to the extent that mass mutual stands for the proposition that a party cannot place a document at issue by utilizing it in connection with a dispositive pretrial motion the court disagrees with that holding comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is under no
