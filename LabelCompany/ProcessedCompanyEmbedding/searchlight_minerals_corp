nvmarketwired  mar    searchlight minerals corp  otcqb  srch  searchlight or the company today provided an update on its clarkdale slag project as it continues its autoclave testing and optimization of gold recovery and moves towards commercial operation and project feasibilitycurrent work programthe company is currently working on all the following key steps in an effort to move expeditiously towards commercial operation pretreatment optimization of the thermal pretreatment of the slag prior to autoclaving is well underway resulting in lowering the required operating parameters and thereby lowering the expected unit operation cost while still producing a high quality iron product the company believes it has optimized the flux formulation for the thermal pretreatment resulting in reducing the flux required by approximately  this has the net effect of doubling the capacity of the autoclave and cutting the perton melting cost significantly the company has recently completed multiple thermal pretreatment tests using the new flux chemistry these tests have consistently yielded  ounces per ton gold or greater contained in the glass with less than  of the gold reporting to the iron product the iron product produced has been consistently greater than  pure ironas a potentially lower cost alternative to the thermal pretreatment used thus far the company has also contacted a major international iron and steel producer regarding use of their patented commercial technology used in direct reduction of iron the producer has agreed to perform a series of bench tests with its technology to determine such technologys applicability the company is currently reviewing the producers proposal and these tests are expected to begin within the next few weeks optimization testing the company has begun testing of the bench and pilot scale autoclave to determine optimum operating conditions with regard to best ratio of solids to liquid in the autoclave and ideal contact time once this testing is completed the results will be used for the design of the autoclave the company has also ordered certain required components to switch from using chlorine reagents to chlorine gas the company believes that this will not only significantly lower supply costs on the commercial unit but will eliminate the potential problems of salt formation in the autoclave which plugged the autoclave discharge in one of the four last pilot scale autoclave runs the company anticipates that this will also simplify and increase recovery of gold from the pregnant leach solution pls vendor estimates the company is obtaining cost estimates from various commercial vendors on all of the major equipment components thermal pretreatment hpgr tower mill autoclave etc in an effort to tighten projections for its various business plan scenarios moving forward personnel the company is starting to hire additional personnel skilled in crushing site design and autoclave design and operation although final site design and construction will be bid to a qualified and experienced engineering procurement and construction management epcm contractor the companys additional personnel are necessary to complete the preliminary design and equipment specifications to provide to prospective construction contractors as part of the bid package as well as oversee the chosen epcms work going forwardmartin oring ceo of searchlight minerals corp noted i am pleased that we are making progress on our autoclave testing and optimization of gold recovery as we move towards project feasibility
