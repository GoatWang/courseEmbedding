corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs

its final stake in rjr nabisco when borden sold a  million block of stock while kkr no longer had any ownership of rjr nabisco by  its original investment would not be fully realized until kkr exited

last remnants of its  investment in july  kkr agreed to sell its stock in borden chemical to apollo management for  billion early s investmentsedit in the early s the absence of an active high yield market prompted kkr to change its tactics avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups one of kkrs largest investments in the s was the leveraged buildup of primedia in partnership with former executives of macmillan publishing which kkr had failed to acquire in  kkr created primedias predecessor kiii

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

as bootstrap investments beginning in – they targeted familyowned businesses many of which had been founded in the years following world war ii which by the s and s were facing succession issues many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive henry kravis speaking at the world economic forum in  their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren

cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint offer with johnson and shearson lehman but was rebuffed and johnson attempted to stonewall kkrs access to financial information from rjr rival private equity firm forstmann little  co was invited into the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for rjr many of the major banking players

guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

 million fee in the rjr takeover at  billion of transaction value including assumed debt rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the deal was first surpassed in july  by the  billion buyout of us hospital operator hospital corporation of america in which kkr participated though the rjr deal was larger adjusted for inflation however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco the rjr transaction benefited many of the parties involved investment bankers and lawyers who advised kkr walked away with over  billion in fees kravis and roberts

restructuring transactions after the rjr nabisco deal kkr did not complete a single investment in  the first such year since  they would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert which filed for bankruptcy in february  kkr began to focus primarily on

been only  billion in middecember  rjr announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in rjr for a new public stock in the company effectively an unusual means of taking rjr public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company rjr issued additional stock to the public in march  to further reduce debt resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of rjrs debt from junk to investment grade kkr began to reduce its ownership in rjr in  when its stock in rjr was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of borden inc a producer of food and beverage products consumer products and industrial products in an unprecedented and complex transaction  the following year in  kkr would divest itself of its final stake in rjr nabisco when borden sold a  million block of stock while kkr no longer had any ownership of rjr nabisco by  its original investment would not be fully realized until kkr exited its last investment in  after sixteen years of efforts including

stock in borden chemical to apollo management for  billion early s investmentsedit in the early s the absence of an active high yield market prompted kkr to change its tactics avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups one of kkrs largest investments in the s was the leveraged buildup of primedia in partnership with former executives of macmillan publishing which kkr had failed to acquire in  kkr created primedias predecessor kiii communications a platform to buy media properties initially completing the

activity in  primedia redeemed kkrs preferred stock in the company but kkr was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the companys stock collapsed in  kkr partnered with fleetnorstar financial group in the  acquisition of the bank of new england from the us federal deposit insurance corporation in january  kkr would exchange its investment for a  interest in fleet bank kkr completed the  buyout of american re corporation from aetna as well as a  interest in tw corporation later known as the flagstar companies and owner of

moved on from the rjr nabisco buyout in  kkr was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record  billion private equity fund the kkr  fund however kkr was still burdened by the performance of the rjr investment and repeated obituaries in the media kkr was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund ie offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals kkr acquired regal cinemas in  only to see the company in bankruptcy by  kkrs activity level would accelerate over the second half of the s making a series of notable investments including spalding holdings corporation and evenflo  newsquest  kindercare learning centers  amphenol corporation

acquired in  for  million and united artists theaters which hicks muse had agreed to acquire for  million in november  shortly after agreeing to the regal takeover the deal with united artists fell apart destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company two years later in  regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy

bursting of the telecom bubble although kkrs track record since rjr nabisco was mixed losses on such investments as regal entertainment group spalding flagstar and primedia previously kiii

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their
