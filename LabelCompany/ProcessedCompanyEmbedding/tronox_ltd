core value about tronox alkali – trifold brochure tronox alkali product literature  million years of history the green river story began some  million years ago when this wyoming site was at the bottom of a  squaremile body of water called lake gosiute over millions of years runoff from the surrounding mountains carried sodiumrich compounds into the lake that sodium reacted with carbon dioxide to form the mineral called trona in time this reaction created the largest trona deposit in the world and as lake gosiute dried up an estimated  billion short tons  billion metric tons of trona were deposited across the green river basin trona ore is naturally occurring sodium sesquicarbonate  since discovery of the trona beds in  the green river basin has become the preferred source of high quality soda ash and other sodium products that ship worldwide vital to everyday products from trona ore we make soda ash sodium bicarbonate scarb® sesqui™ and sodium hydroxide  soda ash is an essential component in making glass fiberglass detergents tableware lighting and display screens for consumer electronics  sodium bicarbonate commonly known as baking soda has countless applications including those in foods an array of consumer products and pharmaceuticals  scarb® is the preferred ingredient in animal feed to balance rumen ph and provide electrolytes for poultry and swine  sesqui™ sodium sesquicarbonate provides the silky clean feeling in bath salts and many cleaning compounds the green river operation has been mining trona for roughly seven decades and today produces more than  million short tons  million metric tons annually tronox alkali ships approximately  railcars and  truck orders of trona each year and we do it all more efficiently and economically on a
