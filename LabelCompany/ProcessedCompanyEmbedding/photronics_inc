through a frontend switch matrix  of the fiber arrays can be connected to form a star network that contains  sensors the networks are interrogated via time division multiplexing technology by which the fbgs are separated by fixed distances of between  and  m the interrogation unit sends a narrow pulse of light energy down each fiber channel and light reflection from the first fbg arrives first at the detector followed by reflections from the others in the array the receiver contains a timegated detection circuit with an edge filter to convert the light signal back to the wavelength domain
