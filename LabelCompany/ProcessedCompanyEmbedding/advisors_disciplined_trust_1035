costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the portfolio consultants security selection

units consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from the last day on which interest was paid on the bonds interest on the bonds is generally paid semiannually although the trust accrues such interest daily because your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement the second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the trusts interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust and may be required to advance its own funds to make trust interest distributions as a result interest account balances are established to limit the need for the trustee to advance funds in connection with such interest distributions if understanding your

value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of securities during the initial offering period based on the aggregate offering side evaluations of the securities determined a on the basis of current offering prices of the securities b if offering prices are not available for any particular security on the basis of current offering prices for comparable securities c by determining the value of securities on the offer side of the market by appraisal or d by any combination of the above after the initial offering period ends we generally determine the value of the securities as described in the preceding sentence based on the bid side evaluations rather than the offering side evaluations the offering side price generally represents the price at which investors in the market are willing to sell a security and the bid side evaluation generally represents the price that investors in the market are willing to pay to buy a security the bid side evaluation is lower than the offering side evaluation as a result of this pricing method

investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the principal value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of securities will fall if interest rates in general increase the securities in your trust typically fall in value when interest rates in general rise and rise in value when interest rates in general fall securities with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to general interest rate changes certain bonds in the portfolio may be subject to interest rate adjustments if either moodys investor services or standard  poors or in certain limited circumstances another ratings service downgrades the rating for such bond or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade the interest rates payable on certain bonds in the portfolio may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades any future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the interest rates payable on such bonds and consequently may adversely affect both the income you receive from the securities in your trust and the value of your units on the other hand increases in a bonds interest rate related to decreases in such bonds credit rating may place additional financial strain on the bonds issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition and further credit rating decreases additionally an increase in a bonds interest rate may increase the risk that the bonds issuer will prepay or call the bond before its stated maturity credit risk is the risk that a securitys issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates in general fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in the portfolio bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating concentration risk is the risk that the value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th based on factors that impact a particular industry because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry a portfolio concentrates in an industry when securities in a particular industry make up  or more of the portfolio the trust invests significantly in bonds issued by materials companies companies in the materials sector are engaged in the manufacture mining processing or distribution of raw materials and intermediate goods used in the industrial sector these may include materials and products such as chemicals commodities forestry products paper products copper iron ore nickel steel aluminum precious metals textiles cement and gypsum general risks of the materials industry include the general state of the economy consolidation domestic and international politics price and supply fluctuations technical progress labor relations government regulations volatile interest rates consumer spending trends overall capital spending levels and excess capacity in addition materials companies may also be significantly affected by volatility of commodity prices currency exchange rates import controls worldwide competition depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control devices these companies are also at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns which may lead to poor investment returns foreign issuer risk because the trust invests in securities of foreign companies the trust involves additional risks that differ from an investment exclusively in domestic securities these risks include the risk of losses due to future political and economic developments international trade conditions foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities the trust also involves the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the securities the trust involves the risk that information about the securities is not publicly available or is inaccurate due to the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards in addition some foreign securities markets are less liquid than us markets this could cause the trust to buy securities at a higher price or sell securities at a lower price than would be the case in a highly liquid market liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security because these securities generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on securities when issued and delayed delivery bonds when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued bonds purchased on a when issued basis have not yet been issued by the issuer on the trusts inception date although such issuer has committed to issue such bonds this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued in addition other bonds may have been purchased by the sponsor on a delayed delivery basis these bonds are expected to be delivered to the trust after the trusts first settlement date normally three business days after the trusts inception date  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis of any bonds delivered after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them original issue discount bonds original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value market discount your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market values were below the principal value on the trusts inception date or your unit purchase date a primary reason for the market value of such bonds being less than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a lower rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds bonds selling at market discounts tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity premium bonds your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market values were above the principal value on the trusts inception date or your unit purchase date a primary reason for the market value of such bonds being higher than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a higher rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the principal value becomes payable because part of the purchase price is effectively returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or any other amount below the trusts purchase price will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the bonds have a market value that represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value how your trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  we created the trust under a trust agreement between advisors asset management inc as depositorsponsor evaluator and supervisor understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th and the bank of new york mellon as trustee to create your trust we deposited securities with the trustee or contracts to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the securities in exchange the trustee delivered units of your trust to us each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in a trust estimated interest distributions per unit and estimated current and longterm returns will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment changing your portfolio your trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed your trust will generally buy and sell securities  to pay expenses  to issue additional units or redeem units  in limited circumstances to protect a trust  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on a trust or  as permitted by the trust agreement when your trust sells securities the composition and diversity of the securities in the portfolio may be altered your trust will generally reject any offer for securities or other property in exchange for the securities in its portfolio if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds we will increase the size of your trust as we sell units when we create additional units we will seek to maintain a portfolio that replicates the principal amounts of the securities in the portfolio when your trust buys securities it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys the securities because the trusts pay the brokerage fees associated with the creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and exchange requests frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses when your trust buys or sells securities we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee in the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for the trust under a contract failed bonds the sponsor is authorized to purchase other bonds replacement bonds the trustee shall pay for replacement bonds out of funds held in connection with the failed bonds and will accept delivery of such bonds to make up the original principal of a trust the replacement bonds must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and the purchase price exclusive of accrued interest may not exceed the principal attributable to the failed bonds whenever a replacement bond has been acquired for a trust the trustee shall within five days thereafter notify all unitholders of a trust of the acquisition of the replacement bond and shall on the next distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th to a trust of the failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement bond in addition a replacement bond must at the time of purchase  have a fixed maturity or disposition date comparable to that of the failed bond it replaces  be purchased at a price that results in a yield to maturity and in a current return which is approximately equivalent to the yield to maturity and current return of the failed bond which it replaces and  be rated at least in the category of bbbbaa or the equivalent by a major rating organization if the right of limited substitution described above shall not be used to acquire replacement bonds in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds to all unitholders of the trust and distribute the principal attributable to such failed bonds on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter in the event a replacement bond is not acquired by the trust the estimated net annual interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current and long term returns might be lowered estimated current and longterm returns the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return as of the business day before a trusts inception date are shown under essential information and illustration of sales fee discounts in the investment summary section for your trust estimated current return is calculated by dividing the current estimated net annual interest income per unit based on the interest rates currently applicable to the bonds by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in the interest rates applicable to the bonds some of which may be subject to adjustments related to changes in the bonds ratings as provided by certain ratings services fees and expenses of your trust and with the default redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units the applicable sales charge associated with units will vary based on sales fee reductions applicable to certain unitholders since the interest rates value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust may change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the trusts inception date this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds weighted average modified duration the weighted average modified duration of the securities in the trust portfolio as of the business day before the trusts inception date is shown under essential information in the investment summary section for your trust modified duration is a calculation that expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions this formula is used to determine the effect that a  change in interest rates might have on the price of a bond for example if a portfolio has a duration of  years then that portfolios value is estimated to decline approximately  for each  increase in interest rates or rise approximately  for each  decrease in interest rates weighted average modified duration of the securities will vary with changes in the value and yield of bonds and with the default redemption maturity exchange sale or other liquidation of bonds the weighted average modified duration of the securities shown under essential information relates only to the bonds in the trust and not to the trust itself or units modified duration does not account for the trust sales charge or expenses and is not intended to predict or guarantee future performance of the bonds or the trust amending the trust agreement the

create an undue burden on your investment investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early the trustee will liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of a trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in a trust if this happens we will refund any sales charge that you paid the trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining securities the trustee will send your final

of units are excluded for purposes of the additional compensation we will pay these amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time following each calendar quarter we currently provide at our own expense and out of our own profits additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell units of this trust and our other products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales a number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these additional amounts such factors may include but are not limited to the level or type of services provided by the intermediary the level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its agents the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list and access to an intermediarys personnel we may make these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediarys representatives or offices obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of our products we make such payments to a substantial majority of intermediaries that sell our products we may also make certain payments to or on behalf of intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales such as the costs of developing or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades payments of such additional compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described above some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products including this trust over other products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units we generally register units for sale in various states in the us we do not register units for sale in any foreign country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into three categories ordinary income distributions capital gains dividends and return of capital ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  percent medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself the trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes investments in certain foreign corporations if the trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders the trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes the trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust would recognize  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in the case of dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to  distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a shortterm capital gain dividend attributable to certain net shortterm capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in addition distributions in respect of units after june   may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners

information  description of securities ratings  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in principal amounts which will generally maintain the same original percentage relationship among the principal amounts of the securities in such trust established by the initial deposit of the securities thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same principal amount of each security and the percentage relationship among the principal amount of each security in the related trust will generally remain the same if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income and capital preservation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of investment grade interestbearing corporate debt obligations there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in the special circumstances discussed herein regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities thus with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in accordance with their terms the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under normal circumstances the sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market factors including advance refunding so that in the opinion of the sponsor the retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of the unitholders the proceeds from any such sales exclusive of any portion which represents accrued interest will be credited to the principal account of such trust for distribution to the unitholders the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of securities to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust securities the trustee shall reject such offer however should any issuance exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or without an initial offer any securities or property received shall be deposited in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities or properties the excess cash proceeds of any such sales will be distributed to unitholders if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the sponsor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the principal account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract including those securities purchased on a when as and if issued basis failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place after the first settlement date accordingly the delivery of such securities may be delayed or may not occur interest on these securities begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery unitholders of all trusts will be at risk with respect to any when as and if issued or delayed delivery securities included in their respective trust ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such securities from the date they commit for units the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities i shall be bonds debentures notes or other straight debt obligations whether secured or unsecured and whether senior or subordinated without equity or other conversion features with fixed maturity dates substantially

the securities they replace and vii shall not cause the units of the related trust to cease to be rated aaa by standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc if the units are so rated the purchase price of the replacement securities exclusive of accrued interest shall not exceed the principal attributable to the failed securities in addition no substitution of replacement securities will be made without an opinion of counsel that such substitution will not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the related trust if such replacement securities when added to all previously purchased replacement securities in the related trust exceed  of the principal amount of securities initially deposited in the related trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall within five days thereafter notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the principal and accrued interest attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such principal they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust whether or not a replacement security is acquired an amount equal to the accrued interest at the coupon rate of the failed securities will be paid to unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the failed securities from the trust if the sponsor determines not to  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th purchase a replacement security or to the date of substitution if a replacement security is purchased all such interest paid to unitholders which accrued after the date of settlement for a purchase of units will be paid by the sponsor in the event a replacement security could not be acquired by a trust the net annual interest income per unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return and estimated longterm return might be lowered subsequent to the trusts inception a security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trusts inception neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination to direct the trustee to dispose of such investment the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the happening of certain extraordinary circumstances certain of the securities may be subject to optional call or mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions in each case prior to their stated maturity a bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer often at a premium over par a refunding is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new bond issue a bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par with proceeds from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue to maturity special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances redemption pursuant to optional call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to special or extraordinary redemption provisions may occur when the securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par that is when they are able to be refinanced at a lower cost the proceeds from any such call or redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions as well as proceeds from the sale of securities and from securities which mature in accordance with their terms from a trust unless utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption will be

zero coupon bonds ie an original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current interest zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the

such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the

than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of

will be held until the next determination of price as discussed in the prospectus had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on the business day before the inception date of the trust the public offering price would have been as shown under essential information in the prospectus the public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under essential information in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units net asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trusts portfolio securities including any accrued interest cash and other assets less all liabilities including accrued expenses by the total number of units outstanding the portfolio securities are valued at their current market value or their fair value as determined in good faith by the evaluator the aggregate bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined a on the basis of current bid or offering prices of the securities b if bid or offering prices are not available for

any combination of the above the foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each business day commencing with the trusts inception date of the securities effective for all sales made during the preceding hour period the interest on the securities deposited in a trust less the related estimated fees and expenses will accrue daily the amount of net interest income which accrues per unit may change as securities mature or are redeemed exchanged or sold or as the expenses of a trust change or the number of outstanding units of a trust changes although payment is normally made three business days following the order for purchase payments may be made prior thereto a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on securities generally is paid monthly or semiannually although a trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date the public offering price of units of a trust will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to the public the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest arising after the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date the second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust the trustee is obligated to provide its own funds at times in order to advanced interest distributions the trustee will recover these advancements when such interest is received interest account balances are established to limit the extent to which it may be necessary for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions the interest account balances are also structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances because of the varying interest payment dates of securities accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders therefore there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to the value of the units if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds held in the interest account for distributions to unitholders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unitholders the trustee benefits thereby comparison of public offering price and redemption price while the net asset value of units during the initial offering period will generally be determined on the basis of the current offering prices of the securities in a trust after the initial offering period the net asset value of units will generally be determined on the basis of the current bid prices of the securities as of the close of business on the business day before the trusts inception date the public offering price per unit exceeded the redemption price at which units could have been redeemed by the amount of the sales fee the bid prices for on securities similar to those in the trust are lower than the offering prices thereof for this reason among others including fluctuations in the market prices of the securities and the fact that the public offering price includes a sales fee the amount realized by a unitholder upon any redemption of units may be less than the price paid for such units public distribution of units the sponsor intends to qualify the units for sale in a number of states units will be sold through dealers who are members of the financial industry regulatory authority inc and through others sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis the sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time

marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the our products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units profits of sponsor the sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents in addition the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the cost of such securities to a trust which is based on the offering side evaluation of the securities the sponsor may also realize profits or losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member an underwriter or underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or competitive bid basis as principal with the motive of marketing such securities to investors at a profit the sponsor may realize additional profits or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust market for units after the initial offering period while not obligated to do so the sponsor may subject to change at any time maintain a market for units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator based on the aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in the trust together with any accrued interest to the expected dates of settlement provided that the repurchase price will not be reduced by any remaining creation and development fee or organization costs during the initial offering period while the sponsor may repurchase units from time to time it does not currently intend to maintain an active secondary market for units to the extent that a market is maintained during the initial offering period the prices at which units will be repurchased will be based upon the aggregate offering side evaluation of the securities in the trust the aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in each trust are expected to be less than the related aggregate offering prices which is generally the evaluation method used during the initial public offering period accordingly unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the sponsor if the sponsor decides to

number of units being redeemed any units redeemed shall be canceled and any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished the price received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of redemption certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption requests under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to avoid this possible backup withholding in the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number one must be provided at the time redemption is requested any amounts paid on redemption representing interest shall be withdrawn from the interest account of a trust to the extent that funds are available for such purpose all other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the principal account for a trust the trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds available for the redemption of units to the extent that securities are sold the size of a trust will be and the diversity of a trust may be reduced

longterm return and estimated current return as of the close of business on the business day before the trusts inception date the estimated longterm return and the estimated current return if

changes in the offering price of the underlying securities and accrued interest therefore there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements or average life of all of the securities in a trust and  takes into account the expenses and sales fee associated with each trust unit since the interest rates market values and estimated retirements of the securities and the expenses of a trust may change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price general information contained in this information supplement
