womens health policy allegations that he abused his former wife call into question his fitness for the job by ayelish mcgarvey  the nation may    pm gmt print comments late last october dr w david hager a prominent obstetriciangynecologist and bush administration appointee to the advisory committee for reproductive health drugs in the food and drug administration fda took to the pulpit as the featured speaker at a morning service he stood in the campus chapel at asbury college a small evangelical christian school nestled among picturesque horse farms in the small town of wilmore in kentuckys bluegrass region hager is an asburian nabob his elderly father is a past president of the college and hager himself currently sits on his alma maters board of trustees even the schools administrative building hager hall bears the family namethat day a mostly friendly audience of  students and faculty packed into the seats in front of him with the autumn sunlight streaming through the stainedglass windows hager opened his bible to the old testament book of ezekiel and looked out into the audience i want to share with you some information about how  god has called me to stand in the gap he declared not only for others but regarding ethical and moral issues in our countryfor hager those moral and ethical issues all appear to revolve around sex in both his medical practice and his advisory role at the fda his ardent evangelical piety anchors his staunch opposition to emergency contraception abortion and premarital sex through his six bookswhich include such titles as stress and the womans body and as jesus cared for women selfhelp tomes that interweave syrupy christian spirituality with paternalistic advice on womens health and relationshipshe has established himself as a leading conservative christian voice on womens health and sexualityand because of his warm relationship with the bush administration hager has had the opportunity to see his ideas influence federal policy in december  the fda advisory committee of which he is a member was asked to consider whether emergency contraception known as plan b should be made available over the counter over hagers dissent the committee voted overwhelmingly to approve the change but the fda rejected its recommendation a highly unusual and controversial decision in which hager the nation has learned played a key role hagers reappointment to the committee which does not require congressional approval is expected this june but bushs nomination of dr lester crawford as fda director has been bogged down in controversy over the issue of emergency contraception crawford was acting director throughout the plan b debacle and senate democrats led by hillary clinton and patty murray are holding up his nomination until the agency revisits its decision about going over the counter with the pillwhen hagers nomination to the fda was announced in the fall of  his conservative christian beliefs drew sharp criticism from democrats and prochoice groups david limbaugh the lesser light in the limbaugh family and author of persecution how liberals are waging political war against christianity said the left had subjected hager to an antichristian litmus test hagers valor in the face of this religious profiling earned him the praise and lasting support of evangelical christians including such luminaries as charles colson dr james dobson and franklin graham son of the rev billy grahamback at asbury hager cast himself as a victim of religious persecution in his sermon you see  there is a war going on in this country he said gravely and im not speaking about the war in iraq its a war being waged against christians particularly evangelical christians it wasnt my scientific record that came under scrutiny at the fda it was my faith  by making myself available god has used me to stand in the breach  just as he has used me he can use youup on the dais several men seated behind hager nodded solemnly in agreement but out in the audience linda carruth daviscoauthor with hager of stress and the womans body and more saliently his former wife of  yearswas enraged it was the most disgusting thing ive ever heard she recalled months later through clenched teethaccording to davis hagers public moralizing on sexual matters clashed with his deplorable treatment of her during their marriage davis alleges that between  and their divorce in  hager repeatedly sodomized her without her consent several sources on and off the record confirmed that she had told them it was the sexual and emotional abuse within their marriage that eventually forced her out i probably wouldnt have objected so much or felt it was so abusive if he had just wanted normal vaginal sex all the time she explained to me but it was the painful invasive totally nonconsensual nature of the anal sex that was so horriblenot once during the uproar over hagers fda appointment did any reporter solicit the opinion of the woman now known as linda davisshe remarried in november  to james davis a methodist minister and relocated to southern georgiaon her husbands record even though she contributed to much of his selfhelp work in the christian arena she remains a religious and political conservative she intermittently thought of telling her story but refrained she says out of respect for her adult children it was hagers sermon at asbury last october that finally changed her mind davis was there to hear her middle son give a vocal performance she was prepared to hear her exhusband inveigh against secular liberals but she was shocked to hear him speak about their divorce when he took to the pulpitin early  hager told the churchgoers that day my world fell apart  after thirtytwo years of marriage i was suddenly alone in a new home that we had built as our dream home time spent doing gods will had kept me from spending the time i needed to nourish my marriage hager noted with pride that in his darkest hour focus on the family estimated that  million people worldwide were praying for himlinda davis quietly fumed in her chair he had the gall to stand under the banner of holiness of the lord and lie by the sin of omission she told me its what he didnt sayits the impression he leftdavid hager is not the fringe character and fundamentalist faith healer that some of his critics have made him out to be in fact he is a wellcredentialed doctor in kentucky hager has long been recognized as a leading obgyn at lexingtons central baptist hospital and a faculty member at the university of kentuckys medical school and in the 0s several magazines including modern healthcare and good housekeeping counted him among the best doctors for women in the nationyet while hager doesnt advocate the substitution of conservative christianity for medicine his religious ideology underlies an allencompassing paternalism in his approach to his women patients even though i was trained as a medical specialist hager explained in the preface to as jesus cared for women it wasnt until i began to see how jesus treated women that i understood how i as a doctor should treat them to underscore this revelation hager recounted case after case in which he acted as confidant spiritual adviser and even father figure to his grateful patients as laid out in his writings hagers worldview is not informed by a sense of inherent equality between men and women instead men are expected to act as benevolent authority figures for the women in their lives in one of his books he refers to a man who raped his wife as selfish and sinful but to model gender relations on the one jesus had with his followers is to leave women dangerously exposed in the event that the men in their lives dont meet the high standard set by god himselftrapped in a permanent state of dependence hoping to be treated wellin tandem with his medical career hager has been an aggressive advocate for the political agenda of the christian right a member of focus on the familys physician resource council and the christian medical and dental society hager assisted the concerned women for america in submitting a citizens petition to the fda in august  to halt distribution and marketing of the abortion pill ru it was this record of conservative activism that ignited a firestorm when the bush administration first floated his name for chairman of the fdas advisory committee in the fall of  in the end the fda found a way to dodge the controversy it issued a stealth announcement of hagers appointment to the panel to be one of eleven members not chairman on christmas eve liberals were furious that they werent able to block his appointment for many months afterward an outraged chain letter alerting women to the appointment of a man with religious views far outside the mainstream snaked its way around the internet lending the whole episode the air of urban legendback in lexington where the couple continued to live linda hager as she was still known at the time was sinking into a deep depression she says though her marriage had been dead for nearly a decade she could not see her way clear to divorce she had no money of her own and few marketable skills but life with david hager had grown unbearable as his public profile increased so did the tension in their home which she says periodically triggered episodes of abuse i would be asleep she recalls and since the sodomy was painful and threatening i woke up sometimes i acquiesced once he had started just to make it go faster and sometimes i tried to push him off  i would confront david later and he would say you asked me to do that and i would say no i never asked for iti first heard of daviss experience in  through a friend of hers after a few telephone conversations she agreed to have me fly down to see her in her modest parsonage in georgia to tell me her story on the record with her mod reading glasses stylish bob and clever outfits davis  is a handsome woman with a sharp wit she spoke with me over two days in januarylinda davis nãe carruth first met david hager on the campus of asbury college in  on the very first date he sat me down and told me he was going to marry me davis remembers i was so overwhelmed by this aggressive approach of i see you and i want you that i was completely seduced by itdavis a former beauty queen was a disengaged student eager to get married and start a family a hagercarruth marriage promised prestige and wealth for the couple her father was a famous methodist evangelist and his father was then president of asbury on the surface it just looked so good she remembers the couple married in 0 while hager completed medical school at the university of kentuckyi dont think i was married even a full year before i realized that i had made a horrible mistake davis says by her account hager was demanding and controlling and the couple shared little emotional intimacy but she says the people around me said well youve made your bed and now you have to lie in it so davis commenced with family making and bore three sons philip in  neal in  and jonathan in sometime between the births of neal and jonathan hager embarked on an affair with a biblestudy classmate who was a friend of davis a close friend of davis remembers her calling long distance when she found out she was angry and distraught like any woman with two children would be but she was committed to working it outsex was always a source of conflict in the marriage though it wasnt emotionally satisfying for her davis says she soon learned that sex could buy peace with hager after a long day of arguing or insure his forgiveness after she spent too much money sex was coinage it was a commodity she said sometimes hager would blithely shift from vaginal to anal sex davis protested he would say oh i didnt mean to have anal sex with you i cant feel the difference davis recalls incredulously and i would say well then youre in the wrong businessby the s according to davis hager was pressuring her to let him videotape and photograph them having sex she consented and eventually she even let hager pay her for sex that she wouldnt have otherwise engaged infor example 0 for oral sex though that didnt happen very often because i hated doing it so much so though it was more painful i would let him sodomize me and he would leave a check on the dresser davis admitted to me with some embarrassment this exchange took place almost weekly for several yearsmoney was an explosive issue in their household hager kept an iron grip on the family purse strings initially the couples single checking account was in hagers name only which meant that davis had to appeal to her husband for cash she says eventually he relented and opened a dual account davis recalls that hager would return home every evening and make a beeline for his office to balance the checkbook often angrily summoning her to account for the money shed spent that day brenda bartella peterson daviss friend of  years and her neighbor at the time witnessed hager berate his wife in their kitchen after one such episode for her part davis set out to subvert hagers financial dominance with profligate spending on credit cards opened in her own name i was not willing to face reality about money she admits i thought well money cant buy happiness but it buys the kind of misery you can learn to live withthese financial atmospherics undoubtedly figured into lindas willingness to accept payment for sex but eventually her conscience caught up with her finally  i said you know david this is like being a prostitute i just cant do this anymore i dont think its healthy for our relationship she recallsby  according to davis account hagers treatment of his wife had moved beyond morally reprehensible to potentially felonious it was a uniquely stressful year for davis her mother dying of cancer had moved in with the family and was in need of constant care at the same time davis was suffering from a seemingly inexplicable exhaustion during the day she began exhibiting a series of strange behaviors like falling asleep in such curious places as the mall and her closet occasionally she wouldas she describes itzone out in midsentence in a conversation and her legs would buckle eventually davis was diagnosed as having narcolepsy a neurological disorder that affects the brains ability to regulate normal sleepwake cyclesfor davis the diagnosis spelled relief and a physician placed her on several medications to attain sleep hygiene or a consistent sleep pattern but davis says it was after the diagnosis that the period of the most severe abuse began for the next seven years hager sodomized davis without her consent while she slept roughly once a month until their divorce in  she claims my sense is that he saw my narcolepsy as an opportunity davis surmises sometimes she fought hager off and he would quit for a while only to circle back later that same night at other times the most expedient thing was to try and somehow get it over with in order to keep any peace i had to maintain the illusion of being available to him at still other moments she says she attempted to avoid hagers predatory advances in various waysfor example by sleeping in other rooms in the house or by struggling to stay awake until hager was in a deep sleep himself but she says nothing worked one of davis lifelong confidantes remembers when davis first told her about the abuse linda was very angry and shaken she recalledas hager began fielding calls from the white house personnel office in  the stress in the householdand with it the abusehit an alltime high according to davis she says she confronted her husband on numerous occasions i said to him every time you do this i hate your guts and it blows a bridge out between us that takes weeks if not months to heal she says that hager would in rare instances admit what he had done and apologize but typically would deny it altogetherfor a while fears of poverty isolation and damnation were enough to keep davis from seeking a divorce she says that she had never cheated on hager but after reuniting with a high school sweetheart not her current husband in the chaotic aftermath of sept  she had a brief affair en route to their first and only rendezvous she prayed aloud i said to the lord all right i do not want to die without having sex with someone i love she remembers i want to know what thats like lord i know that its a sin and i know this is adultery but i have to know what its likedavis was sure that god would strike her dead on her way home that weekend but when nothing happened she took it as a good sign back in lexington she walked through her front door and made a decision right there on the spot i said david i want a divorcemarital rape is a foreign concept to many women with stories like this one indeed linda davis had never heard the term until midway through her divorce in kentucky a person is guilty of rape in the first degree when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person by forcible compulsion or when the victim is incapable of consent because she is physically helpless the same standards apply to the crime of sodomy in the first degree equivalent to rape and distinct from consensual sodomy both are feloniesin sexual assault cases the outcome hinges on the issue of consent a highlevel domestic violence prosecutor in kentucky confirmed that a scenario such as this one in which davis was in a deep sleep from the narcolepsy could meet the physically helpless standard required for a firstdegree offense a prosecutor could also argue that hager engaged in sodomy with davis by means of forcible compulsion even though the alleged encounters did not involve violence according to the kentucky supreme courts decision in  in yarnell v commonwealth a climate of abuse involving constant emotional verbal and physical duress is tantamount to forcible compulsion in that case the victims submitted to the sex acts to avoid a loss of financial security as well as to maintain peace in the householdhistorically the legal system has long been indifferent to the crime of marital sexual assault as recently as  years ago in some states it was legal for a man to force his wife physically into sex or commence having sex without her consentactions that could land a stranger in jail until 0 the kentucky penal code still contained archaic procedural obstacles for prosecuting marital rape including a requirement that it be reported within one year of the offense no other felonyincluding stranger rapecontains a statute of limitations even today marital sexual assault is a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute women like davis often have strong financial incentives to stay with their spouses those who speak out frequently face an uphill battle to convince people that their husbands who may be wellliked and respected are capable of something this ugly at home also because marriages play out over many years some sex is consensual while other sex is nota fact that may complicate matters for a jury in a criminal proceedinglinda davis chose not to bring allegations of marital rape into her divorce proceedings her foremost desires at the time were a fair settlement and minimal disruption for her sons nonetheless she informed her lawyer of the abuse natalie wilson a divorce attorney in lexington asked linda to draw up a working chronology of her marriage to hager it included references to what i would call the sexual abuse wilson explained i had no reason not to believe her  it was an explanation for some of the things that went on in the marriage and it explained her reluctance to share that information with her sonswhich had resulted in her sons being very angry about the fact that she was insisting on the divorceas it turned out when the dust settled after their divorce nearly everyone in the hagers christian and medical circles in lexington had sided with hager who told people that his wife was mentally unstable and had moved in with another man she moved in with friendsdavis had only told a handful of people about the abuse throughout her marriage but several of her longtime confidantes confirmed for this article that she had told them of the abuse at the time it was occurring wilson the attorney spoke to me on the record as did brenda bartella peterson davis close friend of  years several others close to davis spoke to me off the record two refused to speak to me and denounced davis for going public but they did not contest her claims many attempts to interview nearly a dozen of hagers friends and supporters in lexington and around the country were unsuccessfulas for david hager after repeated attempts to interview him for this story we finally spoke for nearly half an hour in early april that conversation was off the record my official comment is that i decline to comment he saidas disturbing as they are on their own linda davis allegations take on even more gravity in light of hagers public role as a custodian of womens health some may argue that this is just a personal matter between a man and his former wifea simple case of he said she said with no public implications that might be soif there were no allegations of criminal conduct if the alleged conduct did not bear any relevance to the public responsibilities of the person in question and if the allegations themselves were not credible and independently corroborated but given that this case fails all of those tests the public has a right to call on dr david hager to answer linda davis charges before he is entrusted with another term after all few women would knowingly choose a sexual abuser as their gynecologist and fewer still would likely be comfortable with the idea of letting one serve as a federal adviser on womens health issueslest inappropriate analogies be drawn between the hager accusations and the politics of personal destruction that nearly brought down the presidency of bill clinton it ought to be remembered that president clintons sexual relationship with monica lewinsky was never alleged to be criminal and did not affect his ability to fulfill his obligations to the nation this of course did not stop the religious right from calling for his head the topic of private vs public behavior has emerged as perhaps the central moral issue raised by bill clintons improper relationship wrote evangelist and hager ally franklin graham at the time but the god of the bible says that what one does in private does matter there needs to be no clash between personal conduct and public appearancehagers fda assignment is an object lesson in the potential influence of a single appointment to a federal advisory committee that in turn affects thousands even millions of lives witness the behindthescenes machinations that set the stage for the fdas ruling against plan b a decision that the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists called a dark stain on the reputation of an evidencebased agency like the fdaon dec    of the fdas advisers on womens health and nonprescription drugs gathered in gaithersburg maryland to evaluate the safety and efficacy of emergency contraception for overthecounter use the plan b pill which drastically reduces the risk of pregnancy when used within seventytwo hours after intercourse has long been available by prescription only its advocates say its greater availability could significantly reduce the nations abortion rate after a long day of highly technical deliberation the advisers voted  to  to drop the prescriptiononly status of emergency contraception ive been on this committee  for almost four years and i would take this to be the safest product that we have seen brought before us announced dr julie johnson a professor at the university of floridas colleges of pharmacy and medicinebut on may   the fda rejected the advice of its own experts and refused to approve the sale of plan b over the counter in his letter to barr laboratories steven galson acting director of the fdas center for drug evaluation and research claimed that barr had not provided adequate data showing just how young adolescent women would actually use the drugthat issue was never voted on by the committee it was however broached by hager at the meeting he mentioned his concern for these younger adolescents several timesin his private practice back in kentucky hager doesnt prescribe emergency contraception because he believes it is an abortifacient and not surprisingly his was one of the four votes against widening its availability but rather than voice his ethical opposition to the product hager emphasized his concern about adolescents which other committee members have since called a political fig leaf according to dr james trussell who voted in favor of plan b the fda had at hand six studies examining whether teens as young as  would increase their risky behavior if they knew they had a backup emergency contraceptiveand none of the studies showed any evidence for that contentionin his sermon at asbury college last fall hager proudly recounted his role in the plan b decision after two days of hearings he said the committees voted to approve this overthecounter sale by  to four i was asked to write a minority opinion that was sent to the commissioner of the fda  now the opinion i wrote was not from an evangelical christian perspective  but i argued it from a scientific perspective and god took that information and he used it through this minority report to influence the decision emphasis addednone of the four panel members i spoke with for this article were aware of hagers minority opinion an fda spokeswoman told me that the fda did not ask for a minority opinion from this advisory committee though she was unable to say whether any individual within the agency had requested such a document from hager this past january the fda missed a deadline to respond to a new application from barr laboratories and any forward motion on making plan b more widely available has completely stalledmeanwhile david hagers stock has been rising among conservatives though his term on the fda panel is set to expire on june 0 observers on both sides of the political divide anticipate his reappointment in march i spoke with janice shaw crouse executive director and senior fellow at the beverly lahaye institute the research arm of concerned women for america she is one of hagers staunchest advocates in washington some credit her with engineering his fda appointment crouse sits alongside hager on asbury colleges board of trustees in may when informed of the allegations against him she declined to revise her earlier statement i would not be at all surprised to see dr hager elevated to a higher position or to another very influential position when it comes to womens care she told me because he has shown that he does care about women regardless of  the religious issues that people want to try to raise  when people try to discredit him he continues on he hasnt caved in and he hasnt waffled he has been a gentleman he is a person of character and integrity and i think people admire that

of the nation featuring dr hager late last october dr w david hager a prominent obstetriciangynecologist and bush administration appointee to the advisory committee for reproductive health drugs in the food and drug administration fda took to the pulpit as the featured speaker at a morning service he stood in the campus chapel at asbury college a small evangelical christian school nestled among picturesque horse farms in the small town of wilmore in kentucky’s bluegrass region hager is an asburian nabob his elderly father is a past president of the college and hager himself currently sits on his alma mater’s board of trustees even the school’s administrative building hager hall bears the family name that day a mostly friendly audience of  students and faculty packed into the seats in front of him with the autumn sunlight streaming through the stainedglass windows hager opened his bible to the old testament book of ezekiel and looked out into the audience “i want to share with you some information about how…god has called me to stand in the gap” he declared “not only for others but regarding ethical and moral issues in our country” for hager those moral and ethical issues all appear to revolve around sex in both his medical practice and his advisory role at the fda his ardent evangelical piety anchors his staunch opposition to emergency contraception abortion and premarital sex through his six books–which include such titles as stress and the woman’s body and as jesus cared for women selfhelp tomes that interweave syrupy christian spirituality with paternalistic advice on women’s health and relationships–he has established himself as a leading conservative christian voice on women’s health and sexuality and because of his warm relationship with the bush administration hager has had the opportunity to see his ideas influence federal policy in december  the fda advisory committee of which he is a member was asked to consider whether emergency contraception known as plan b should be made available over the counter over hager’s dissent the committee voted overwhelmingly to approve the change but the fda rejected its recommendation a highly unusual and controversial decision in which hager the nation has learned played a key role hager’s reappointment to the committee which does not require congressional approval is expected this june but bush’s nomination of dr lester crawford as fda director has been bogged down in controversy over the issue of emergency contraception crawford was acting director throughout the plan b debacle and senate democrats led by hillary clinton and patty murray are holding up his nomination until the agency revisits its decision about going over the counter with the pill most popularthe circular firing squad isn’t amusing anymoresean spicer has embarrassed himself—badlyalec is talking about changing the way senators are elected and taking away your votehow the left can win in the southpaul ryan hands donald trump a blank check for endless war when hager’s nomination to the fda was announced in the fall of  his conservative christian beliefs drew sharp criticism from democrats and prochoice groups david limbaugh the lesser light in the limbaugh family and author of persecution how liberals are waging political war against christianity said the left had subjected hager to an “antichristian litmus test” hager’s valor in the face of this “religious profiling” earned him the praise and lasting support of evangelical christians including such luminaries as charles colson dr james dobson and franklin graham son of the rev billy graham back at asbury hager cast himself as a victim of religious persecution in his sermon “you see…there is a war going on in this country” he said gravely “and i’m not speaking about the war in iraq it’s a war being waged against christians particularly evangelical christians it wasn’t my scientific record that came under scrutiny at the fda it was my faith… by making myself available god has used me to stand in the breach… just as he has used me he can use you” up on the dais several men seated behind hager nodded solemnly in agreement but out in the audience linda carruth davis–coauthor with hager of stress and the woman’s body and more saliently his former wife of thirtytwo years–was enraged “it was the most disgusting thing i’ve ever heard” she recalled months later through clenched teeth according to davis hager’s public moralizing on sexual matters clashed with his deplorable treatment of her during their marriage davis alleges that between  and their divorce in  hager repeatedly sodomized her without her consent several sources on and off the record confirmed that she had told them it was the sexual and emotional abuse within their marriage that eventually forced her out “i probably wouldn’t have objected so much or felt it was so abusive if he had just wanted normal vaginal sex all the time” she explained to me “but it was the painful invasive totally nonconsensual nature of the anal sex that was so horrible” not once during the uproar over hager’s fda appointment did any reporter solicit the opinion of the woman now known as linda davis–she remarried in november  to james davis a methodist minister and relocated to southern georgia–on her husband’s record even though she contributed to much of his selfhelp work in the christian arena she remains a religious and political conservative she intermittently thought of telling her story but refrained she says out of respect for her adult children it was hager’s sermon at asbury last october that finally changed her mind davis was there to hear her middle son give a vocal performance she was prepared to hear her exhusband inveigh against secular liberals but she was shocked to hear him speak about their divorce when he took to the pulpit “in early ” hager told the churchgoers that day “my world fell apart… after thirtytwo years of marriage i was suddenly alone in a new home that we had built as our dream home time spent ‘doing god’s will’ had kept me from spending the time i needed to nourish my marriage” hager noted with pride that in his darkest hour focus on the family estimated that  million people worldwide were praying for him linda davis quietly fumed in her chair “he had the gall to stand under the banner of holiness of the lord and lie by the sin of omission” she told me “it’s what he didn‘t say–it’s the impression he left” david hager is not the fringe character and fundamentalist faith healer that some of his critics have made him out to be in fact he is a wellcredentialed doctor in kentucky hager has long been recognized as a leading obgyn at lexington’s central baptist hospital and a faculty member at the university of kentucky’s medical school and in the 0s several magazines including modern healthcare and good housekeeping counted him among the best doctors for women in the nation yet while hager doesn’t advocate the substitution of conservative christianity for medicine his religious ideology underlies an allencompassing paternalism in his approach to his women patients “even though i was trained as a medical specialist” hager explained in the preface to as jesus cared for women “it wasn’t until i began to see how jesus treated women that i understood how i as a doctor should treat them” to underscore this revelation hager recounted case after case in which he acted as confidant spiritual adviser and even father figure to his grateful patients as laid out in his writings hager’s worldview is not informed by a sense of inherent equality between men and women instead men are expected to act as benevolent authority figures for the women in their lives in one of his books he refers to a man who raped his wife as “selfish” and “sinful” but to model gender relations on the one jesus had with his followers is to leave women dangerously exposed in the event that the men in their lives don’t meet the high standard set by god himself–trapped in a permanent state of dependence hoping to be treated well in tandem with his medical career hager has been an aggressive advocate for the political agenda of the christian right a member of focus on the family’s physician resource council and the christian medical and dental society hager assisted the concerned women for america in submitting a “citizen’s petition” to the fda in august  to halt distribution and marketing of the abortion pill ru it was this record of conservative activism that ignited a firestorm when the bush administration first floated his name for chairman of the fda’s advisory committee in the fall of  in the end the fda found a way to dodge the controversy it issued a stealth announcement of hager’s appointment to the panel to be one of eleven members not chairman on christmas eve liberals were furious that they weren’t able to block his appointment for many months afterward an outraged chain letter alerting women to the appointment of a man with religious views “far outside the mainstream” snaked its way around the internet lending the whole episode the air of urban legend back in lexington where the couple continued to live linda hager as she was still known at the time was sinking into a deep depression she says though her marriage had been dead for nearly a decade she could not see her way clear to divorce she had no money of her own and few marketable skills but life with david hager had grown unbearable as his public profile increased so did the tension in their home which she says periodically triggered episodes of abuse “i would be asleep” she recalls “and since the sodomy was painful and threatening i woke up sometimes i acquiesced once he had started just to make it go faster and sometimes i tried to push him off… i would confront david later and he would say ‘you asked me to do that’ and i would say ‘no i never asked for it” i first heard of davis’s experience in  through a friend of hers after a few telephone conversations she agreed to have me fly down to see her in her modest parsonage in georgia to tell me her story on the record with her mod reading glasses stylish bob and clever outfits davis  is a handsome woman with a sharp wit she spoke with me over two days in january linda davis née carruth first met david hager on the campus of asbury college in  “on the very first date he sat me down and told me he was going to marry me” davis remembers “i was so overwhelmed by this aggressive approach of ‘i see you and i want you’ that i was completely seduced by it” davis a former beauty queen was a disengaged student eager to get married and start a family a hagercarruth marriage promised prestige and wealth for the couple her father was a famous methodist evangelist and his father was then president of asbury “on the surface it just looked so good” she remembers the couple married in 0 while hager completed medical school at the university of kentucky “i don’t think i was married even a full year before i realized that i had made a horrible mistake” davis says by her account hager was demanding and controlling and the couple shared little emotional intimacy “but” she says “the people around me said ‘well you’ve made your bed and now you have to lie in it” so davis commenced with family making and bore three sons philip in  neal in  and jonathan in  sometime between the births of neal and jonathan hager embarked on an affair with a biblestudy classmate who was a friend of davis’s a close friend of davis’s remembers her calling long distance when she found out “she was angry and distraught like any woman with two children would be but she was committed to working it out” sex was always a source of conflict in the marriage though it wasn’t emotionally satisfying for her davis says she soon learned that sex could “buy” peace with hager after a long day of arguing or insure his forgiveness after she spent too much money “sex was coinage it was a commodity” she said sometimes hager would blithely shift from vaginal to anal sex davis protested “he would say ‘oh i didn’t mean to have anal sex with you i can’t feel the difference” davis recalls incredulously “and i would say ‘well then you’re in the wrong business” by the s according to davis hager was pressuring her to let him videotape and photograph them having sex she consented and eventually she even let hager pay her for sex that she wouldn’t have otherwise engaged in–for example 0 for oral sex “though that didn’t happen very often because i hated doing it so much so though it was more painful i would let him sodomize me and he would leave a check on the dresser” davis admitted to me with some embarrassment this exchange took place almost weekly for several years money was an explosive issue in their household hager kept an iron grip on the family purse strings initially the couple’s single checking account was in hager’s name only which meant that davis had to appeal to her husband for cash she says eventually he relented and opened a dual account davis recalls that hager would return home every evening and make a beeline for his office to balance the checkbook often angrily summoning her to account for the money she’d spent that day brenda bartella peterson davis’s friend of twentyfive years and her neighbor at the time witnessed hager berate his wife in their kitchen after one such episode for her part davis set out to subvert hager’s financial dominance with profligate spending on credit cards opened in her own name “i was not willing to face reality about money” she admits “i thought ‘well money can’t buy happiness but it buys the kind of misery you can learn to live with” these financial atmospherics undoubtedly figured into linda’s willingness to accept payment for sex but eventually her conscience caught up with her “finally…i said ‘you know david this is like being a prostitute i just can’t do this anymore i don’t think it’s healthy for our relationship” she recalls by  according to davis’s account hager’s treatment of his wife had moved beyond morally reprehensible to potentially felonious it was a uniquely stressful year for davis her mother dying of cancer had moved in with the family and was in need of constant care at the same time davis was suffering from a seemingly inexplicable exhaustion during the day she began exhibiting a series of strange behaviors like falling asleep in such curious places as the mall and her closet occasionally she would–as she describes it–“zone out” in midsentence in a conversation and her legs would buckle eventually davis was diagnosed as having narcolepsy a neurological disorder that affects the brain’s ability to regulate normal sleepwake cycles for davis the diagnosis spelled relief and a physician placed her on several medications to attain “sleep hygiene” or a consistent sleep pattern but davis says it was after the diagnosis that the period of the most severe abuse began for the next seven years hager sodomized davis without her consent while she slept roughly once a month until their divorce in  she claims “my sense is that he saw my narcolepsy as an opportunity” davis surmises sometimes she fought hager off and he would quit for a while only to circle back later that same night at other times “the most expedient thing was to try and somehow get it over with in order to keep any peace i had to maintain the illusion of being available to him” at still other moments she says she attempted to avoid hager’s predatory advances in various ways–for example by sleeping in other rooms in the house or by struggling to stay awake until hager was in a deep sleep himself but she says nothing worked one of davis’s lifelong confidantes remembers when davis first told her about the abuse “linda was very angry and shaken” she recalled as hager began fielding calls from the white house personnel office in  the stress in the household–and with it the abuse–hit an alltime high according to davis she says she confronted her husband on numerous occasions “i said to him ‘every time you do this i hate your guts and it blows a bridge out between us that takes weeks if not months to heal” she says that hager would in rare instances admit what he had done and apologize but typically would deny it altogether for a while fears of poverty isolation and damnation were enough to keep davis from seeking a divorce she says that she had never cheated on hager but after reuniting with a high school sweetheart not her current husband in the chaotic aftermath of september  she had a brief affair en route to their first and only rendezvous she prayed aloud “i said to the lord ‘all right i do not want to die without having sex with someone i love” she remembers “‘i want to know what that’s like lord i know that it’s a sin and i know this is adultery but i have to know what it’s like” davis was sure that god would strike her dead on her way home that weekend but when nothing happened she took it as a good sign back in lexington she walked through her front door and made a decision right there on the spot “i said ‘david i want a divorce” marital rape is a foreign concept to many women with stories like this one indeed linda davis had never heard the term until midway through her divorce in kentucky a person is guilty of rape in the first degree when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person by “forcible compulsion” or when the victim is incapable of consent because she is physically helpless the same standards apply to the crime of sodomy in the first degree equivalent to rape and distinct from consensual sodomy both are felonies in sexual assault cases the outcome hinges on the issue of consent a highlevel domestic violence prosecutor in kentucky confirmed that a scenario such as this one in which davis was in a deep sleep from the narcolepsy could meet the “physically helpless” standard required for a firstdegree offense a prosecutor could also argue that hager engaged in sodomy with davis by means of forcible compulsion even though the alleged encounters did not involve violence according to the kentucky supreme court’s decision in  in yarnell v commonwealth a climate of abuse involving “constant emotional verbal and physical duress” is tantamount to forcible compulsion in that case the victims submitted to the sex acts to avoid a loss of financial security as well as to maintain peace in the household historically the legal system has long been indifferent to the crime of marital sexual assault as recently as twelve years ago in some states it was legal for a man to force his wife physically into sex or commence having sex without her consent–actions that could land a stranger in jail until 0 the kentucky penal code still contained archaic procedural obstacles for prosecuting marital rape including a requirement that it be reported within one year of the offense no other felony–including “stranger rape”–contains a statute of limitations even today marital sexual assault is a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute women like davis often have strong financial incentives to stay with their spouses those who speak out frequently face an uphill battle to convince people that their husbands who may be well liked and respected are capable of something this ugly at home also because marriages play out over many years some sex is consensual while other sex is not–a fact that may complicate matters for a jury in a criminal proceeding linda davis chose not to bring allegations of marital rape into her divorce proceedings her foremost desires at the time were a fair settlement and minimal disruption for her sons nonetheless she informed her lawyer of the abuse natalie wilson a divorce attorney in lexington asked linda to draw up a working chronology of her marriage to hager “it included references to what i would call the sexual abuse” wilson explained “i had no reason not to believe her… it was an explanation for some of the things that went on in the marriage and it explained her reluctance to share that information with her sons–which had resulted in her sons’ being very angry about the fact that she was insisting on the divorce” as it turned out when the dust settled after their divorce nearly everyone in the hagers’ christian and medical circles in lexington had sided with hager who told people that his wife was mentally unstable and had moved in with another man she moved in with friends davis had only told a handful of people about the abuse throughout her marriage but several of her longtime confidantes confirmed for this article that she had told them of the abuse at the time it was occurring wilson the attorney spoke to me on the record as did brenda bartella peterson davis’s close friend of twentyfive years several others close to davis spoke to me off the record two refused to speak to me and denounced davis for going public but they did not contest her claims many attempts to interview nearly a dozen of hager’s friends and supporters in lexington and around the country were unsuccessful as for david hager after repeated attempts to interview him for this story we finally spoke for nearly half an hour in early april that conversation was off the record “my official comment is that i decline to comment” he said as disturbing as they are on their own linda davis’s allegations take on even more gravity in light of hager’s public role as a custodian of women’s health some may argue that this is just a personal matter between a man and his former wife–a simple case of “he said she said” with no public implications that might be so–if there were no allegations of criminal conduct if the alleged conduct did not bear any relevance to the public responsibilities of the person in question and if the allegations themselves were not credible and independently corroborated but given that this case fails all of those tests the public has a right to call on dr david hager to answer linda davis’s charges before he is entrusted with another term after all few women would knowingly choose a sexual abuser as their gynecologist and fewer still would likely be comfortable with the idea of letting one serve as a federal adviser on women’s health issues lest inappropriate analogies be drawn between the hager accusations and the politics of personal destruction that nearly brought down the presidency of bill clinton it ought to be remembered that president clinton’s sexual relationship with monica lewinsky was never alleged to be criminal and did not affect his ability to fulfill his obligations to the nation this of course did not stop the religious right from calling for his head “the topic of private vs public behavior has emerged as perhaps the central moral issue raised by bill clinton’s ‘improper relationship” wrote evangelist and hager ally franklin graham at the time “but the god of the bible says that what one does in private does matter there needs to be no clash between personal conduct and public appearance” hager’s fda assignment is an object lesson in the potential influence of a single appointment to a federal advisory committee that in turn affects thousands even millions of lives witness the behindthescenes machinations that set the stage for the fda’s ruling against plan b a decision that the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists called a “dark stain on the reputation of an evidencebased agency like the fda” on december   twentyseven of the fda’s advisers on women’s health and nonprescription drugs gathered in gaithersburg maryland to evaluate the safety and efficacy of emergency contraception for overthecounter use the plan b pill which drastically reduces the risk of pregnancy when used within seventytwo hours after intercourse has long been available by prescription only its advocates say its greater availability could significantly reduce the nation’s abortion rate after a long day of highly technical deliberation the advisers voted  to  to drop the prescriptiononly status of emergency contraception “i’ve been on this committee…for almost four years and i would take this to be the safest product that we have seen brought before us” announced dr julie johnson a professor at the university of florida’s colleges of pharmacy and medicine but on may   the fda rejected the advice of its own experts and refused to approve the sale of plan b over the counter in his letter to barr laboratories steven galson acting director of the fda’s center for drug evaluation and research claimed that barr had not provided adequate data showing just how young adolescent women would actually use the drug that issue was never voted on by the committee it was however broached by hager at the meeting he mentioned his concern for these “younger adolescents” several times in his private practice back in kentucky hager doesn’t prescribe emergency contraception because he believes it is an abortifacient and not surprisingly his was one of the four votes against widening its availability but rather than voice his ethical opposition to the product hager emphasized his concern about adolescents which other committee members have since called a “political fig leaf” according to dr james trussell who voted in favor of plan b the fda had at hand six studies examining whether teens as young as  would increase their “risky” behavior if they knew they had a backup emergency contraceptive–and none of the studies showed any evidence for that contention in his sermon at asbury college last fall hager proudly recounted his role in the plan b decision “after two days of hearings” he said “the committees voted to approve this overthecounter sale by  to  i was asked to write a minority opinion that was sent to the commissioner of the fda… now the opinion i wrote was not from an evangelical christian perspective… but i argued it from a scientific perspective and god took that information and he used it through this minority report to influence the decision” emphasis added none of the four panel members i spoke with for this article were aware of hager’s “minority opinion” an fda spokeswoman told me that “the fda did not ask for a minority opinion from this advisory committee” though she was unable to say whether any individual within the agency had requested such a document from hager this past january the fda missed a deadline to respond to a new application from barr laboratories and any forward motion on making plan b more widely available has completely stalled meanwhile david hager’s stock has been rising among conservatives though his term on the fda panel is set to expire on june 0 observers on both sides of the political divide anticipate his reappointment in march i spoke with janice shaw crouse executive director and senior fellow at the beverly lahaye institute the research arm of concerned women for america she is one of hager’s staunchest advocates in washington some credit her with engineering his fda appointment crouse sits alongside hager on asbury college’s board of trustees in may when informed of the allegations against him she declined to revise her earlier statement “i would not be at all surprised to see dr hager elevated to a higher position or to another very influential position when it comes to women’s care” she told me “because he has shown that he does care about women regardless of…the religious issues that people want to try to raise… when people try to discredit him he continues on he hasn’t caved in and he hasn’t waffled he has been a gentleman he is a person of character and
