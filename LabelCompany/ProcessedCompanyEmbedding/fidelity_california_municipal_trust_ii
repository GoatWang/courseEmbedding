message photoofedwardcjohnsond dear shareholder although financial turmoil in pacific basin countries was a catalyst for significant volatility in us markets in late october and into november the standard  poors  index has risen more than  yeartodate almost three times its historical annual average meanwhile bond markets  primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive news on the inflation front  continued to post solid returns through the first  months of  while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds you should also keep money youll need in the near future in a more stable investment finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases if you have questions please call us at  we are available  hours a day seven days a week to provide you the information you need to make the investments that are right for you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line to evaluate a money market funds historical performance you can look at either total return or yield total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of the funds dividend income yield measures the income paid by a fund since a money market fund tries to maintain a  share price yield is an important measure of performance if fidelity had not reimbursed certain fund expenses the life of fund total return would have been lower cumulative total returns periods ended november   past  past  life of year years fund fidelity new jersey municipal    money market fund new jersey taxfree money market    funds average cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case one year five years or since the fund started on march   for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the new jersey taxfree money market funds average which reflects the performance of municipal money market funds with similar objectives tracked by ibc financial data inc the past one year average represents a peer group of  money market funds the periods covered by ibc financial data inc numbers are the closest available match to those covered by the fund average annual total returns periods ended november   past  past  life

col  value  row  col  value  fidelity new jersey municipal money market fund new jersey taxfree money market funds average          yield refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period yields for money market funds are usually for sevenday periods expressed as annual percentage rates a yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or compounded is called an effective yield the chart above shows the funds current sevenday yield at quarterly intervals over the past year you can compare these yields to the new jersey taxfree money market funds average or you can look at the funds taxequivalent yield which is based on a combined effective  federal and state income tax rate of  a portion of the funds income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax figures for the new jersey taxfree money market funds average are from ibc financial data inc a money market funds total returns and yields will vary and reflect past results rather than predict future performance comparing performance yields on taxfree investments are usually lower than yields on taxable investments however a straight comparison between the two may be misleading because it ignores the way taxes reduce taxable returns taxequivalent yield  the yield you would have to earn on a similar taxable investment to match the taxfree yield  makes the comparison more meaningful keep in mind that the us government neither insures nor guarantees a money market fund and there is no assurance that a money fund will maintain a  share price checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with scott orr portfolio manager of fidelity new jersey municipal money market fund q scott what was the investing environment like over the past  months a during the first several months of the period investors tried to figure out when the federal reserve board might raise the fed funds rate which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans over that period data showed growth in the economy but the pace of that growth was inconsistent and there were no signs of inflation as a result the fed kept the fed funds rate steady at  in february and march however signs that the economy was growing at a stronger clip changed market sentiment expectations of a rate increase culminated in the feds announcement at its march  meeting that it had increased the fed funds rate from  to  for the next month or so the market expected the fed to continue to raise rates however at its may meeting the fed decided to hold off because economic growth had moderated and inflation was still benign q whats happened since then a economic activity was moderate to fairly strong but inflation remained in check the fed opted to keep rates unchanged but remained biased toward raising rates if signs of stronger inflation emerge in fact in midoctober several fed officials made comments indicating that they were thinking of raising rates in order to slow the economy however that was before economic and market turmoil hit southeast asia in late october and continued through november because of this instability in the global financial markets it now appears that the fed will hold off raising rates in order to avoid roiling the markets and causing more anxiety as a result most market participants feel the fed will wait until the market disruption in asia moderates before deciding if a strong us domestic economy still warrants a rate increase q what was the funds strategy during this period a for most of the period the environment was one in which we expected rates to be higher in the ensuing months as a result part of our strategy was to invest in variablerate securities because they move up or down with changes in interest rates at the same time we sought to buy fixedrate notes when they were expected to provide a higher yield than variablerate securities over the terms of the notes in the new jersey market fixedrate instruments often offer a yield advantage over variablerate notes because there is much stronger demand for the latter as a result of focusing more on longerterm fixedrate securities in order to pick up extra yield the fund tended to maintain an average maturity in the  day range since september though the maturity has come down somewhat because variablerate securities and new shortterm issues became more attractive as a result the average maturity was down to  days as of november  q how did the fund perform a the funds sevenday yield on november   was  compared to  six months ago the more recent sevenday yield was the equivalent of a  taxable rate of return for new jersey investors in the  combined state and federal income tax bracket through november   the funds month total return was  compared to  for the new jersey taxfree money market funds average according to ibc financial data inc q whats your outlook a over the next several months i believe the fed will still be biased toward raising rates and that it is looking for reasons to do so at this point the fed has held off raising rates in spite of the strength of the economy because inflation has remained under control and the uncertainty created in global financial markets from the fallout in asia has continued with any inkling of inflationary pressures however i believe the fed would pull the trigger and raise the fed funds rate at least one more time as a result im managing the fund with the expectation that that will happen although the timing of a rate increase is unclear a rate increase in the next few months may help the us economy but it might send the worldwide financial markets into an uproar therefore i think the fed would like asian markets to stabilize before it takes action the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions fund facts goal high
