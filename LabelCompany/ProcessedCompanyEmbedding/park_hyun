interpretations of products systems and services especially as they relate to the issue of human enterprise in design technology and innovation in information systems is research thus my research interest and contributions are condensed into four genres –  ictenabled innovations  designeruser interaction design thinking and user experience  smart cities and smart tourism and  social theories and qualitative research  in the broader areas of innovation information systems and new product development research  ictenabled innovations  designeruser interaction design thinking and user experience  smart cities and smart tourism  social theories and qualitative research  ictenabled innovations traditionally most researchers in innovation studies have concentrated on the following three areas features of innovation innovation ubiquity and requirements of innovation although i defer to these prior researchers’ endeavors i believe there remains research paucity in that prior efforts have failed to highlight the areas of design collaboration among different stakeholders in that prior efforts have failed to highlight the areas of design collaboration among different stakeholders in the process of design and it innovation my research on the other hand addresses this gap my approach to this issue is different in that i examine the relationships between humaninteractions and a variety of types of design innovations in terms of a micro perspective in design routines based on these interests i am conducting a qualitative study to identify characteristic sequences and patterns that occur in the design and it innovation dissertation title patterns of interaction between designers and users committee richard j boland chair youngjin yoo kalle lyytinen fred collapy and john paul stephens summary despite more than  years of design process research design researchers and practitioners continue to wrestle with the challenges of incorporating users in their design process my dissertation explores patterns of interaction between designers and users in the design process i studied designers’ practices of user interaction with a view toward generative designeruser interaction my research includes three stages of progressively deeper qualitative research on designer  user interaction stage  field studies of seven user centered design projects stage  interviews with  designers collecting  project narratives of direct user interaction during a design project and stage  interviews with  additional designers collecting  additional project narratives of cocreation with users in the design process this research addresses theoretical methodological and practical gaps my findings include proposing a theoretical framework to understand users’ roles in existing design methods and to theorize an expanded design vocabulary which identifies two latent learning loops based on bourdieu’s theory of practice this integrated model demonstrates how designers could explicitly communicate with users at three learning levels bringing users into design interacting with users and cocreating with users in the design process
