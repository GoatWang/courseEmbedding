rather than markets water island capital takes an opportunistic and flexible approach to eventdriven opportunities around the globe eventdriven investing is a highly specialized strategy designed to profit from the behavior of equity and debt instruments trading within the timelines of specific corporate events such as mergers acquisitions restructurings refinancings recapitalizations and distressed situations in seeking to capture lowcorrelated absolute returns water island capital does not invest based on market fundamentals but rather on event fundamentals when partnering with water island capital investors have access to global eventdriven investing including singlestrategy and multistrategy approaches in both fixed income and equities merger arbitrage » seeking to profit from the successful completion of corporate reorganizations merger arbitrage pursues absolute returns with low correlation water island capital’s approach may utilize both the equity and credit securities of firms involved in announced transactions along with hedging strategies designed to minimize market exposure and volatility equity special situations » equity special situations employs an eventdriven investment focus around a wide range of opportunities such as spinoffs restructurings syndicates and prearbitrage situations we look for equity securities that we believe are significantly mispriced and offer an attractive riskreward opportunity at the same time we implement hedging techniques to minimize volatility and to isolate the alpha opportunity associated with the corporate event credit opportunities » our credit opportunities strategy pursues a nontraditional catalystdriven approach to fixed income investing this unconstrained alternative credit strategy focuses on a broad range of catalysts and events such as mergers refinancings deep value credit and regulatory changes we hold both long and short investments and may employ convertible arbitrage merger arbitrage or capital structure arbitrage techniques in order to exploit security mispricings or inefficiencies while seeking to limit credit and interest rate risk eventdriven » our eventdriven strategy invests in opportunities where the return potential is more correlated to the outcomes of specific catalysts and events rather than to overall market direction we implement our strategy via an optimized blended approach to our three core investment capabilities we adopt a flexible and cycle agnostic approach because different markets offer different opportunities water island capital does not invest
