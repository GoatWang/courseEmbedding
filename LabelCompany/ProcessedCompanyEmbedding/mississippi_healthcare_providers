state’s exchange two insurers in  humana leaving for  but magnolia staying by louise norris healthinsuranceorg contributor april   mississippi uses the federallyrun exchange for individual market plans so residents who buy their own health insurance enroll through healthcaregov but the state runs one mississippi which is the shop exchange for small businesses blue cross blue shield of mississippi has a strong presence in the mississippi individual market but they do not participate in the exchange one insurer will offer plans in  two carriers are offering plans in the mississippi exchange for  magnoliaambetter offers plans in all  counties humana offers plans in  counties humana is exiting the individual market at the end of  however which means mississippi is currently slated to have just one insurer in the exchange in  and the trump administration’s continued uncertainty over federal funding for insurers could further destabilize the markets between now and the start of open enrollment but in late april centene magnoliaambetter in mississippi announced that they’re planning to remain in the exchanges in  in the states where they currently participate according to centene chairman and ceo michael neidorff “centene’s exchange experience continues to be favorable and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range” this is certainly good news for mississippi as a centene exit would have meant no insurers in the exchange anywhere in the state in  that now appears now to be unlikely for insurers that wish to offer  plans form filings in mississippi are due may   and rate filings are due june   enrollment nearly  percent lower than   people enrolled in private individual market plans through the mississippi exchange via healthcaregov during the  open enrollment period which ended january   for perspective  people enrolled during the  open enrollment period so enrollment for  was almost  percent lower but a significant number of the  enrollees didn’t pay for their coverage or dropped it early in the year about double the nationwide percentage by march  total effectuated enrollment in individual market plans through the mississippi exchange stood at  health insurance in mississippi under the trump administration in december  hhs reported that  people had gained coverage in mississippi from  to  as a result of the aca if republican lawmakers continue to push for passage of the american health care act many of those people are at risk of losing their coverage the center for american progress a leftleaning organization estimates that  people in mississippi would lose coverage under the ahca they used the cbo’s analysis and broke it down by congressional district despite the prospect of those coverage losses mississippi governor phil bryant endorsed the american health care act mississippi is one of the leasthealthy states in the country it’s one of  states where three of every ten nonelderly adults residents has a preexisting condition that would make it difficult or impossible to get new individual market health insurance if the aca and its guaranteedissue provision are repealed the ahca calls for preexisting condition protections to technically remain in place but lawmakers added an amendment in late april that gives states the option to allow insurers to charge higher premiums when people have preexisting conditions and a gap in coverage and to also offer plans that don’t cover the aca’s essential health benefits those changes would essentially gut the aca’s protections for people with preexisting conditions although it would be up to the state to decide whether to seek a waiver because mississippi hasn’t accepted federal funding under the aca to expand medicaid the impact of aca repeal wouldn’t be as significant as it would be in other states that’s because mississippi’s poorest residents are already suffering in the coverage gap unable to realistically obtain any sort of health insurance repealing the aca won’t change their situation but it will continue to be dire however it could end up being worse than just keeping the status quo in mississippi with regards to medicaid the ahca would switch medicaid from its current openended federal matching to a percapita allotment system of federal funding this would result in less federal funding over the long run and some of the almost  people who are already covered by medicaid in mississippi might be in danger of losing their coverage mississippi residents already struggle with the cost of care and  percent of the under population in state owes money to hospitals or doctors unitedhealthcare exited individual market humana following them out the door mississippi is one of  states where unitedhealthcare exited the individual health insurance market at the end of  that left humana and magnoliaambetter as the only carriers offering plans in the exchange although humana exited the exchanges in several states at the end of  they stayed in mississippi that decision was shortlived however as humana announced in february  that they would no longer offer individual market plans in any state after  united was the only carrier in the mississippi exchange that offered coverage in all  counties in the state in  although magnolia has expanded statewide in  for  magnolia is currently the only insurer slated to offer coverage in mississippi’s exchange  rates and carriers two carriers are offering plans in the mississippi exchange in  in late august  mississippi insurance commissioner mike chaney reported that a third health insurer had proposed joining the exchange statewide but had been rejected by hhs due to “lack of an adequate network and specialists in each county” in  humana offered exchange plans in  counties in mississippi but but has reduced their coverage area to  counties in  magnoliaambetter offered plans in  counties in  but has expanded statewide for  so  counties have two carrier options while  counties have just one carrier in the exchange in  the following rate increases were proposed and approved for the mississippi exchange in  although they apply to unsubsidized premiums and subsidies offset the rate hikes as long as enrollees were willing to be flexible about possibly needing to switch plans in order to get the best rate  percent of mississippi exchange enrollees received subsidies in  — the highest percentage in the country humana  percent humana had about  exchange enrollees in  magnoliaambetter  percent magnolia had about  exchange enrollees in  blue cross blue shield of mississippi is a major carrier in the state but they have thus far not participated in the exchange more details below they had an average rate increase of  percent for  for their offexchange plans at aca signups charles gaba calculated an average rate increase of  percent for the two exchange carriers which is very similar to the rate hike for bcbsms offexchange plans  enrollment during the  open enrollment period private plan enrollment in mississippi’s exchange reached  people this included renewals and new enrollees and also accounted for early attrition through february  for perspective  people enrolled in coverage through the mississippi exchange during the  open enrollment period effectuated enrollment stood at  by march   that’s an attrition rate of  percent which is more than double the national average rate of attrition during the first quarter effectuated enrollment in mississippi stood at  on march   nationwide effectuated enrollment was almost  percent higher in march  than it had been in march  but there are a handful of states where enrollment declined including mississippi to clarify enrollment at the end of the  open enrollment period was higher in mississippi than it had been at the end of the  open enrollment period but a larger number of people cancelled or didn’t pay for their coverage in  resulting in a lower effectuated enrollment by march at the end of open enrollment  percent of mississippi exchange enrollees were receiving premium subsidies by the end of march however  percent of the enrollees with effectuated coverage were receiving premium subsidies the people who weren’t receiving subsidies dropped their coverage or never paid for it in the first place at a higher rate than those who were receiving subsidies the average premium subsidy as of march was  per month in mississippi open enrollment for  is now over you can still enroll in a plan for  if you experience a qualifying event and native americans can enroll yearround in addition medicaid and chip enrollment continue yearround open enrollment for  is tentatively scheduled to begin november   legislation introduced to block obamacare on february  republican state senator michael d watson jr introduced sb which would effectively block all mississippi agencies and employees from having any part in enforcement or implementation of the aca the legislation would also prohibit the state from creating a statebased exchange or expanding medicaid neither of those have been done in mississippi but legislation blocking them would make it more difficult for a future governor to set a new course for mississippi sb was referred to the senate’s medicaid committee as soon as it was introduced and ultimately died in committee the legislation did not include any language in terms of how obamacare should be replaced or any sort of alternate structure to make health insurance affordable and accessible to the people of mississippi it would merely have blocked the state from taking any part in the continued implementation of the law  rates lower than they were in  once all of the plan selections for  had been finalized  percent of mississippi exchange enrollees qualified for premium subsidies their average presubsidy premium is  per month a little lower than the month average across all states that use healthcaregov and their average aftersubsidy premium is month the average aftersubsidy premium across all healthcaregov states is month in   percent of mississippi exchange enrollees qualified for subsidies their average presubsidy premium was month and their average aftersubsidy premium was month so while average presubsidy premiums declined in mississippi from  to  average aftersubsidy premiums increased that could be a result of more people with higher average incomes enrolling in  or it could be a result of enrollees selecting more robust – and more expensive – coverage three carriers offer plans through the mississippi exchange humana ambettermagnolia and unitedhealthcare according to the mississippi business journal average rate changes for  were magnolia healthambetter average decrease of  percent  enrollees as of november   humana average decrease of  percent  enrollees as of november  unitedhealthcare average increase of  percent  enrollees as of november  but only humana’s rate filing which was approved asproposed was displayed on healthcaregov’s rate review tool for  average rate changes for humana plans in the mississippi exchange ranged from a  percent decrease to a  percent increase rate filings for magnoliaambetter and unitedhealthcare don’t show up on healthcaregov’s rate review tool even after the data was adjusted to show all rates as opposed to only rate increases of ten percent or more as was the case from june through october the mississippi business journal obtained the above enrollment numbers from the mississippi insurance department they indicate significant attrition from july  through october as the exchange had  people with inforce private plan coverage at the end of june and the total as of november  was only about  based on the enrollment as of november  the weighted average rate change in the mississippi exchange was only about  percent for  – and that came on the heels of an average rate decrease in  statewide the average benchmark secondlowestcost silver plan premium is  percent less expensive in  than it was in  out of the  states that used healthcaregov in  only four have lower average benchmark premiums in  and mississippi is one of them in jackson the average benchmark premium for a  year old decreased by  percent – from month to month those are unsubsidized premiums for people who qualify for subsidies the aftersubsidy monthly premium is lower and as of mid more than  percent of mississippi’s exchange enrollees were receiving premium subsidies – the highest percentage in the nation unsurprising since subsidy eligibility is based on income and mississippi has the lowest average household income in the us the benchmark plan isn’t necessarily the same plan from one year to the next so the changes in benchmark premiums don’t really tell us much about how premiums on specific plans are changing but premium subsidies are tied to benchark premiums so average subsidies in mississippi are lower in  than they were in  highlighting the importance of shopping around during open enrollment as opposed to letting plans autorenew offexchange carriers —  outside the exchange blue cross blue shield of mississippi requested an average rate increase of more than  percent but their final approved rate increase was  percent also offexchange enterprise live and freedom life both ended up with average rate increases of  percent unitedhealthcare was also listed in the rate review tool with a rate increase of  percent but only for offexchange plans that have a total of  enrollees blue cross blue shield had the lion’s share of the market in mississippi prior to  roughly  percent but they have not participated in the exchange their substantial rate increase for  may have been a driving factor in the increase in enrollments for the mississippi exchange since premium subsidies are only available through the exchange for a  yearold nonsmoker in hinds county jackson the cheapest plan available from bcbs of mississippi was month in  the plan had a  deductible  maximum outofpocket and no subsidies were available since it was only sold outside the exchange that same applicant – with an annual income of  and no dependents – could get a plan through the exchange in  for month with a  deductible for a plan with a  deductible  maximum outofpocket and copays for office visits and prescriptions which the bcbs plan did not offer the price was month through the exchange and it’s important to note that if the person’s income was lower than  the premium was lower as well as opposed to a plan outside the exchange which doesn’t include any premium relief regardless of how little the applicant earns  rates according to an analysis published by the commonwealth fund average premiums in mississippi were  percent lower in  than in  the weighted analysis looked at premium amounts differences in premiums between urbansuburbanrural areas within states and insurer participation but a similar analysis from pricewaterhousecoopers found an average rate decrease of  percent from  to  – still a significant rate decrease but not as substantial as the commonwealth fund’s result in  mississippi’s presubsidy average premium was month – the fifthhighest among the  states that used healthcaregov  enrollment data about  mississippi residents selected health plans through healthcaregov during  open enrollment while that’s  more signups than during  open enrollment it is still just  percent of those eligible to enroll according to kaiser family foundation estimates and attrition was particularly high in mississippi in  by the end of march just  people had effectuated exchange coverage in place and that had dropped to  by the end of june that’s  percent of initial enrollments nationwide  percent of enrollees had effectuated coverage by the end of june so mississippi was well below average in that regard the kaiser family foundation estimated that  percent of mississippi’s eligible population had enrolled in coverage through the exchange by the end of march – a little lower than the national average of  percent but higher than twelve other states mississippi’s exchange population tended to be relatively lowincome with  percent having incomes under  percent of the poverty level  those enrollees were eligible for costsharing subsidies and  percent of them selected silver plans meaning that they obtained coverage that included the costsharing subsidies cost sharing subsidies are only available if you purchase a silver plan in all more than  percent of the  people who had coverage at the end of june were enrolled in plans that included costsharing subsidies participating insurers – a timeline unitedhealthcare joined the mississippi marketplace for  bringing the total number of insurers on the individual exchange to three in the state humana and magnolia health plan were part of the marketplace in  and returned for  all three insurers continued to participate in  but for  united has left the state and mississippi’s exchange is back to just humana and magnolia united’s entry brought welcome competition to mississippi in  and  in  residents of some counties had access to just a single insurer’s plans through the exchange in  and  – back when mississippi was in the process of creating it’s own staterun exchange – blue cross blue shield of mississippi which had more than  percent of the market share in mississippi had told insurance commissioner mike chaney that they would participate in the exchange but due to conflicts among the state’s leadership hhs rejected mississippi’s exchange application more details below and at that point bcbs of mississippi pulled out that left humana and magnolia health plan as the only two carriers for  but leading up to the federallyrun exchange’s fall  debut mississippi had a problem the two carriers had selected the counties in which they wanted to operate and  of the state’s  counties had no participating carriers at all humana ultimately decided to go ahead and offer coverage statewide in  but only four of the state’s counties had plans available from both carriers in  in  when unitedhealthcare joined the exchange every county in mississippi had at least two participating carriers and  counties had coverage options available from all three carriers for  humana’s plans were not available in all areas of the state but unitedhealthcare expanded to offer coverage statewide so every county in the state still had at least two carriers from which to choose and  counties had plans available from all three carriers in  there are  counties that have two carriers and  counties where the only carrier offering plans in the exchange is magnolia for  magnolia is the only insurer with plans to participate in the mississippi exchange unless something changes over the summer all residents in mississippi will have only magnolia as an option in the exchange king v burwell chaney had a plan in case scotus ruling had been different in june  the supreme court ruled that subsidies are legal in every state regardless of whether the exchange is run by the state or the federal government that was great news for mississippi residents insurers and healthcare providers  percent of the people who are enrolled in private plans through the mississippi exchange are receiving premium subsidies the mississippi business journal reported that insurance commissioner mike chaney had a contingency plan to protect subsidies for state residents if the supreme court had eliminated them  rather than creating a staterun exchange “it would entail funneling federal money through the existing mississippi comprehensive health insurance risk pool association to private insurers”  but the journal noted that the plan would be contingent upon approval from the governor lt governor and the speaker of the house chaney had worked to establish a staterun exchange back in  –  but was foiled by the governor and the legislature politico also reported that the state had a backup plan but they explained that chaney wanted “mississippi to use existing private health insurance exchanges to enroll people qualifying for subsidies while avoiding the federal government’s technology” the mississippi comprehensive health insurance risk pool is the staterun highrisk pool that predates the aca private health insurance exchanges are not run by the government – rather they’re set up by health insurance carriers brokers and benefits managers to provide a platform for people to shop for coverage mississippi’s insurance department did not return phone calls to clear up the discrepancy but it did appear that in early  the state was working on a backup plan that could have been put in place if the supreme court had eliminated subsidies in many states there were no such contingency plans and enrollees would have had few options but to terminate their coverage if subsidies had been eliminated enrollment assistance the university of mississippi medical center got the majority of the navigator grants that were awarded by the federal government in august  to fund enrollment efforts in mississippi for  of  million that mississippi received  went to ummc oak hill baptist church got the remaining navigator funding that year

what form a health insurance exchange should take in mississippi chaney current gov phil bryant and former gov haley barbour are all republicans and on record as opposing the affordable care act however chaney consistently maintained that the state would be better off running its own exchange chaney pushed hard for a staterun exchange in  he announced that the mississippi comprehensive health insurance risk pool association would operate an exchange the risk pool association developed a plan in which the exchange would be developed in four phases with work outsourced early exchange planning was carried out by the board of directors of the risk pool association and an advisory board appointed by chaney the risk pool association the advisory board and the insurance department continued working throughout  and in november chaney notified the us department of health and human services hhs that mississippi intended to implement a staterun exchange however bryant told hhs in december  that chaney had overstepped his authority it was also in  that antiaca influences from outside mississippi including the koch brothers and the cato institute began pressuring cheney to give up his push for a staterun exchange but onemississippi the staterun exchange that cheney created opened in october  a year before the acasanctioned exchanges nationwide onemississippi didn’t have any premium subsidies those wouldn’t be available until the first aca open enrollment period began in october  but it did have coverage for sale the task at that point switched to obtaining federal approval to have onemississippi be the state’s official aca exchange but ultimately governor bryant’s opposition to the exchange was its downfall in february  hhs rejected mississippi’s exchange blueprint telling chaney that it simply wouldn’t work without the governor’s support the exchange would have needed to work with the mississippi medicaid program – overseen by a bryant appointee – and there were too many concerns that bryant would be able to derail the exchange via funding or hiring decisions the federal government said at the time that they “didn’t feel that they should get involved in a battle between two elected state officials” mississippi was the only state whose exchange blueprint was rejected by the federal government and in february  onemississippi shut down the federal government runs the individual exchange in mississippi but onemississippi opened back up as the staterun shop exchange in the spring of  offering health insurance options for small businesses several factors constrain marketplace enrollment in the magnolia state political opposition to the affordable care act is very strong many residents are distrustful of government assistance and outreach efforts are limited in a state with a  percent poverty rate many people find premiums too expensive — even with subsidies factored in and the medicaid coverage gap is significant in mississippi kaiser family foundation estimates that  of mississippi’s  uninsured residents are in the coverage gap – ineligible for medicaid because the state has refused federal funding to expand
