dennis gilles chief executive officer through a combination of an excellent pipeline of projects and a favorable legislative environment we believe that we will improve our yearoveryear performance and advance the company to achieve our  goal of over  mwsdevelopment projects  megawattswgp geysers california  megawatts the conditional use permit from sonoma county which approves the construction plan for the wgp geysers power plant was received on december   combined with the large generator interconnection agreement that was received from the california independent system operator and pacific gas  electric this completes the long lead permits and agreements that are needed for the project once final engineering design is finished and a ppa is executed an air quality permit and building permit will be needed before on site construction will beginengineering optimization of the new hybrid power plant design is continuing and budgetary quotes for the major equipment have been received our engineers and consultants are working in concert with epc contractors to examine all aspects of the construction cycle with a focus on reducing construction costs the hybrid design will dramatically increase the volume of water available for injection back into the reservoir which will result in increased power generation over the life of the projectrecent discussions have been held with a number of potential power purchasers in california for the generation from the wgp geysers plant and are continuing interest has been expressed by a number of them for base load renewable power to replace fossil fuel based power generation that is being phased out of their portfoliossan emidio phase ii nevada  megawatts the updated reservoir model announced january th resulted in a significant increase in the potential size of the san emidio phase ii reservoir of up to  net megawatts data from flow tests that took place in late  from two wells were incorporated into a probabilistic power density model which estimates the net generation potential of a reservoir the power density model is not a monte carlo style heat in place estimate based on the flow rate and temperature produced by the two wells and by measurement of pressure response both in the wells and across the wellfield the model estimates that the most likely outcome  probability is  net megawatts of generation capacity within a  square mile area the minimum level of generation capacity  probability occurs in a  square mile area and has  net megawatts of generation capacitythese two wells are approximately  feet apart along the new structural trend identified in the southwest zone which is still open for expansion temperature gradient well data and seismic information indicate a potential strike length for the southwest zone of up to  feet this compares to a strike length for the primary producing wellfield at san emidio phase i of  feet suggesting the potential for a much larger resource in this southwest zone permits to deepen three remaining temperature gradient wells were received from the bureau of land management in december  these three wells will be deepened to the targeted reservoir depth to further explore the southwest zone when weather allows if successful it will extend the length of the productive reservoir by  feetthe three power plant units that were purchased in  are available to provide this project with the major long lead equipment requirements for  net megawatts of power depending upon cooling system used the increased san emidio ii reservoir capacity with a °f temperature fits the design range of the equipment these new unused components represent approximately  of the equipment needed for a complete facility similar to the companys neal hot springs operationread moregiven the larger resource capacity at san emidio ii we have cancelled our small generator interconnection agreement that was completed in  and are preparing to apply for a large generator interconnection agreement in support of the higher expected output additionally transmission studies that contemplate power sales into southern california will also be conducted since there is now a transmission path from northern nevada going south on the new kv  megawatt transmission line that was completed in january in july  the company was awarded a  million department of energy cost share grant under the development of technologies for sensing analyzing and utilizing novel subsurface signals in support of the subsurface technology and engineering subter crosscut initiative the program approved under the grant includes using new subsurface technologies at both san emidio and crescent valley to identify fluid flow paths in the geothermal resource the data collection phase of the program was completed at san emidio in december the data is being interpreted to determine whether viable targets have been identified upon approval from the doe a second phase of the grant program is designed to confirm the findings by drilling the total program cost is  million with the company providing  in cost shareel ceibillo guatemala  megawatts on january   the guatemalan government through the national electrical energy commission comisión nacional de energía eléctricacnee announced that it is preparing to issue an rfp later this year for  megawatts of power of which  megawatts is to be reserved specifically for geothermal energy when the rfp is issued the el ceibillo project will be bid into the processwith the commercial shallow resource now proven in  a deep well to test the producing structure down dip from well ec is planned to a projected depth of  to  feet  meters ec was completed to a depth of  feet  meters and intersected a high permeability zone at  feet  meters with a temperature of °f °c chemical analysis of fluid samples taken from ec at the end of a flow test indicate a potential deep reservoir temperature of  to °f  to °c a deeper intersection in the reservoir could increase the reservoir capacity and production temperature and change the design of the power plant well ec which was drilled in  to a depth of  feet  meters found a measured bottomhole temperature of °f °c but did not intersect permeability the comparative geology between ec and ec suggests a fault or other structure feeding the reservoir may be located in the area between the two wellsexpansion projects  megawattsneal hot springs oregon  hybrid cooling  megawatts a third water supply well for the project was drilled in december but due to extreme winter weather the well has not been completed and tested to date productive water zones were intersected in the well but a liner must be installed before the well can be flow tested a fourth site has been selected and will be drilled once weather allows the project currently has one well available from drilling in  that can supply approximately  gallons per minute the minimum amount of water needed for a hybrid cooling system is approximately  gallons per minute for each unitthe ability to use water cooling during the  months of summer and fall would increase power generation when current air cooling results in a lower plant output an initial engineering evaluation of various hybrid cooling methods was completed by power engineers inc which confirms the economic viability of hybrid cooling if enough water can be foundraft river idaho  wellfield optimization  megawatts additional production is now planned from well rrg an idle well with significant permeability that has been used for injection in the past flow testing and reservoir modeling was performed during the th quarter  to evaluate the well for conversion to production flow test results showed an initial flowing temperature of over °f which is expected to increase once under production to approximately °f reservoir modeling shows that rrg is capable of producing up to  gpm yielding approximately  to  additional net megawatts of generation from the plant a production pump has been ordered and is expected to be installed by the end of the first quarter  generation is expected to ramp up during the second quarter as the production wellfield is rebalanced to maximize its output additional sources of geothermal fluid from other wells on the project are also under study to further increase the generation level of the plantthe initial effort to expand the output of raft river from its current  megawatts to its maximum contracted level of  megawatts began with the drilling of a second production leg at rrg in june  the second production leg was drilled to a depth of  feet and was completed at the end of july several small zones of permeability were encountered in the new production leg after testing the well a new pump was installed and the well resumed production in early september the well temperature has plateaued at approximately °f down from the original production temperature of °f and the well is now producing approximately  gallons per minute less flow than before drilling it is believed that during drilling operations the original production leg of the well was damaged by scale formation which blinded off its producing fractures despite these results the overall production at the plant has returned to normal levels and current production is believed to be coming mostly from the newly drilled production leg operations to recover the damaged production leg with an industry standard chemical treatment will be considered in the futurewell rrg which has been used as part of an  million thermal stimulation grant primarily funded by the department of energy has significantly increased the injection capacity to  gallons per minute from an original level of  gallons per minute this increase in injection capacity provides all of the additional volume needed to accept the flow from well rrg without requiring any new drillingabout us geothermal inc us
