commission sec the financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap of the united states and are presented in us dollars   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks money market funds and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which in the opinion of management are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value at april   and  the company had  in cash and cash equivalents respectively   financial instruments   the company follows asc  fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level      f table of contents       the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below   level    level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level    level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data   level    level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   the companys financial instruments consist of cash accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amount due to related party pursuant to asc  the fair value of our cash is determined based on level  inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets we believe that the fair values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their carrying values current because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations   concentrations of credit risk   the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents the company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness at times its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits the companys management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds and as such it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured   related party   the company follows asc  related party disclosures for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions   stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with asc topic  to date the company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options   related party balances and transactions   the company records all related party balances and transactions in accordance with asc topic  – related party disclosures     f table of contents       income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes the asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized   net loss per share of common stock   the company has adopted asc topic  earnings per share eps which requires presentation of basic eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation in the accompanying financial statements basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   the company has no potentially dilutive securities such as options or warrants currently issued and outstanding   recent accounting pronouncements   management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements the companys management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the companys financial statements   note  – due to related party   in support of the companys efforts and cash requirements it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing those loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and due on demand   during the year ended april   and  a director of the company advanced  and  respectively to the company to cover the companys operating expenses the advances borrowed from the company during april   and  were for company expenses directly paid by the director on behalf of the company as of april   and  the company owed this director  and  respectively   during the year ended april    loan was forgiven by a previous director of the company and was recorded as additional paidin capital   note  – capital stock   during the years ended april   and  no new shares were issued as of april   and  the company had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding   note  – commitments and contingencies   the company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property an officer has provided office services without charge there is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein the officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future     f table of contents       note  – going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern however the company had no revenues since inception the company currently has limited working capital and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time these factors raise substantial doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern   management anticipates that the company will be dependent for the near future on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses the company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets in light of managements efforts there are no assurances that the company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern   note  – income tax   the company provides for income taxes under asc  income taxes under the asset and liability method of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations   the provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of  to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons       years ended       april                federal income tax benefit attributable to             current operations             less

when a change in ownership occurs net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years     f table of contents     item  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   there were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure of a type described in item  aiv or any reportable event as described in item  av of regulation sk   item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls   under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under rule ae and rule d e promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended as of april   based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at such time to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act were recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management was inappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company is continuing to evaluate disclosure controls on an ongoing basis   based on managements assessment the company determined that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of april   based on the material weaknesses described below     · because the company consists of one person who acts as the sole officer and director of the company there are limited controls over information processing   · there is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management is composed of only one person in order to remedy this situation we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties currently it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible   · the company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and thus the company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process   · there is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions   the company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions   as a result of this material weakness our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of april   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the companys financial reporting   in order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity to us gaap management believes that this will lessen the possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate      table of
