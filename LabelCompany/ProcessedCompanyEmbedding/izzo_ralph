ralph izzo lays out the future of energy in new jersey pseg ceo ralph izzo lays out the future of energy in new jersey news provided by public service enterprise group pseg may    et share this article mount laurel nj may   prnewswire  ralph izzo president chairman and chief executive officer of public service enterprise group pseg today called for a set of statewide regulatory reforms that would create financial incentives for utilities to help their customers reduce athome energy use as well as expand access to renewable energy and new energysaving technologies  he also encouraged new jersey utility regulators to consider longerterm approval of energy infrastructure projects which would lead to additional job creation izzo delivered his remarks at a state energy forum sponsored by the chamber of commerce southern new jersey  customers demands are changing izzo said they want more reliability they want more resilient power they want cleaner energy and they want access to smart technology to better understand their energy usage – all while keeping bills affordable in order to meet these competing demands utilities and the regulatory framework that governs them must adapt from a system that encourages utilities to sell as much energy as possible to a new system that provides incentives for the utility to promote greater energy efficiency izzo said energy efficiency is the critical component that will drive the utility of the future izzo said the cheapest kilowatt remains the one that is not needed while new jersey has set aggressive goals for renewables we have only taken baby steps in the area of energy efficiency he said  the universal reach of utilities touching every home and business in their service territory  means that investment in energy efficiency at the utility level would ensure all customers at every income level would reap the benefits of those programs similarly utilities can help promote universal access to renewable energy sources such as solar energy pseg has already spent more than  billion on solar projects in new jersey and  other states while the sun is free we need to remember that converting it to energy is not izzo said we need to invest in renewables in a way that helps match those who pay for the attributes of renewables all ratepayers and taxpayers with those who reap the benefits of those investments  izzo also discussed the role utilities can play in helping increase the speed of adoption and depth of penetration of new technology the utility with its network and strong customer relations can be the ultimate sales channel for new energy products and services he said  izzo also called for a new look at how new jersey regulates the longterm modernization of gas and electric infrastructure he said the state can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the longterm projectapproval process without reducing regulatory oversight new jerseys board of public utilities typically approves infrastructure projects – such as psegs programs to floodproof electric substations or replace aging castiron gas mains – in threeyear increments a longerterm approval would allow utilities to plan their purchasing and hiring more efficiently and lead to creation of more jobs izzo said as new jersey strives to meet changing customer demands izzo warned that if new jersey nuclear plants are allowed to close the state will move backward in the areas of reliability clean air and affordable electric bills if done right the future of energy in new jersey is one where we use less energy the energy we use is cleaner and more reliable and bills are affordable izzo said public service enterprise group nyse peg is a publicly traded diversified energy company with annual revenues of  billion

an article from feature pseg ceo ralph izzo utility of the future will sell less electricity but play more meaningful role author by davide savenije • published june   reducing your customer’s need for your main product is not widely seen as a successful business strategy to put it mildly for many years the electric utility industry would have agreed with that assessment sell more electricity the line of thinking went and earn more money but there are signs that is changing as new technologies emerge consumers seek to be more economical and policymakers look to reduce greenhouse gas emissions utilities are asking themselves can we actually sell less and earn more ralph izzo chairman and ceo of public service enterprise group pseg an electric and gas utility holding company with over  billion in assets and  million electric customers in its new jersey service territory thinks so “i would like to see the utilities regulated in such a way that they are indifferent at least and encouraged at best to invest in energy efficiency” izzo told utility dive in an interview last week we can expand the role of the utility the utility regulatory model that was constructed in early s to provide customers with universal access to reliable and affordable electricity the industry seems to agree is outofdate the future of the utility business lies in optimizing the use of electricity for every customer izzo said “even i don’t wake up in the morning saying ‘i can’t wait to use electricity and natural gas’” he added “but i do wake up in the morning and say ‘i can’t wait to see game  of the nhl stanley cup’” instead of growing electric sales utilities should focus on providing the “leastexpensiveaspossible” electricity to “people using the minimum amount of electricity they need to use in order to live the lifestyle they want to live” izzo said  pseg ceo the way to get to leastexpensive electricity is to use less of it auto image  link as opposed to focusing only on rates the pseg chief indicated “the way to get to leastexpensive electricity may be to use less of it” in the near term pseg will introduce an energy efficiency request to regulators similar to past programs “that should allow us to do meaningful work for about  months” he said but izzo said he intends to use that time frame “to engage in a more robust conversation to talk about how we can expand the role of the utility and have an even more profound and meaningful role” you have to talk about lost revenue utilities would be “a very effective vehicle” for investing in greater energy efficiency he suggested because the utility’s hurdle rate – the minimum acceptable rate of return on investment – is far lower than the customer’s the returns on energy efficiency investments by consumers are “far higher than the returns that we would accept in our business” izzo explained but “the imperfections in the marketplace impede the ability to get widescale deployment of energy efficiency out there” pseg ceo utilities are best vehicle for energy efficiency investments because of low hurdle rate auto image  link “what you need to do is replace the consumer with an interested investor – in this case the utility” he said “then when energy service company x brings a project to us we are more likely to say yes than when they bring it to the consumer” the wins for the environment and consumer are obvious izzo said but regulators and policymakers “need to focus on making this a win for the investor community” “what you have to talk about is lost revenue” izzo told utility dive “you want to create a situation whereby the reduction in cost exceeds our reduction in revenue so that we can make up for some of the lost revenue streams we would have realized through the use of our wires” “if the customer uses  less electricity their bill has to go down by something less than ” he said and the financial savings seen by the customer should vary depending on the cost of the technologies deployed to achieve those savings were not going to be gone tomorrow regulators should enable utilities to own behindthemeter assets and reward them for doing so izzo explained utilities should not only be “indifferent to investing in smart thermostats more efficient lighting systems higherefficiency boilers and air conditioners” he added but be “as motivated to do that as i would to build a class h substation” pseg ceo energy efficiency is huge opportunity for utilities to partner with new market entrants auto image  link izzo sees energy efficiency as a “huge opportunity” for utilities to partner with market entrants but suggested that new players will face a “tough uphill climb” in getting “disinterested” customers to invest on their own new entrants can go it alone izzo said but they “will automatically be awarded a level of trust and credibility” if they lean on the utility’s brand if the utility – which already has the prized relationship with the customer  can show the customer the energy savings they might see and offer them solutions to achieve those savings izzo said that “gives the customer a greater degree of confidence than someone knocking on the door and saying ‘boy do i have a deal for you’” the customers “know that we’re not going to be gone tomorrow” izzo said “we’ve been here for over a century and we’ll make our assessments based on good technical work and we’ll offer them something we can stand by” share tweet post email print filed under efficiency  demand response regulation  policy top
