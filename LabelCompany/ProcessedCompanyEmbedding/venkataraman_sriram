business school date written may   abstract durable goods producers can face a pernicious feedback loop between their financial health and the demand for their products financial distress can reduce demand for a firm’s products if it causes consumers to worry about the firm’s ability to supply flows of goods and services — such as warranties spare parts and maintenance — that are typically bundled with the primary durable good this drop in demand harms the firm’s profitability exacerbating its financial distress which in turn further heightens the demand impact in principle this cycle can spiral until the firm falls into bankruptcy the feedback mechanism might even sustain “bank runlike” selffulfilling expectations eg douglas w diamond and philip h dybvig  if consumers suddenly believe a firm is distressed even incorrectly the resulting demand effect could push the firm into distress and even bankruptcy concerns about such effects in auto manufacturing played a prominent role in policy discussions during the recent recession some feared that the already struggling general motors and chrysler would be further harmed due to consumers’ worries about warranty viability in march  the us treasury announced the creation of the warranty commitment program which guaranteed warranties of new gm or chrysler cars should either firm go bankrupt this program was justified by its defenders as a device that could break the vicious circle between consumer expectations of firms’ financial health and demand for their products serving a function akin to bank deposit insurance if the feedback mechanism was weak however such policies would be at best a wasteful distraction and at worst an unnecessary and possibly large transfer from taxpayers to automakers and their consumers measuring this feedback loop’s strength is important for evaluating how it affects equilibrium outcomes in this and other durable goods markets as well as in evaluating interventions like the warranty commitment program in this paper we measure the impact of this feedback mechanism on outcomes in the auto market one of the key inputs into this analysis comes from our related work ali hortaçsu gregor matvos chad syverson and sriram venkataraman  where we measure the direct effect of automakers’ financial distress on consumer demand we found that shifting an automaker’s probability of default from zero to a near certain bankruptcy reduced the market prices of that producer’s cars by roughly five percent eg  on a  car here we measure the equilibrium impact of this taking into account its feedback effect on an automaker’s financial health and its influence on that firm’s pricing and debt service choices we do so by building a simple model where an automaker builds and sells cars to earn profits for its equity holders and service its debt payments consumers’ demand depends on their expectations about whether the firm will continue operating ie not default on its debt and therefore be able to provide full flows of bundled goods and services that arrive after the initial purchase we find that multiple equilibria in prices and therefore sales and operating profits and bankruptcy probabilities can arise in the model confirming the possibility of selffulfilling expectations we then combine our estimate of how much an automaker’s financial distress affects demand for its cars with measures of the model’s other parameters gleaned from data on actual automakers’ operations and solve the model to see if multiple equilibria are likely in the current auto market finally we do a counterfactual exercise to gauge how market outcomes would change if consumer demand were unaffected by an automaker’s financial health suggested citation suggested citation hortacsu

abstract we measure the effects of pre and postrelease blog volume blog valence and advertising on the performance of 7 movies in  geographic markets of the us we attribute the variation in blog effects across markets to differences in demographic characteristics of markets combined with differences across demographic groups in their access and exposure to blogs as well as their responsiveness conditional on access we study the effects of prerelease factors on opening day boxoffice performance and of pre and postrelease factors on boxoffice performance one month after release our estimation accounts for confounding factors in the measurement of these effects via the use of instrumental variables we find considerable heterogeneity in the effects across consumer and firm generated media and across geographic markets with gender income race and age driving acrossmarket differences release day performance is impacted most by prerelease blog volume and advertising whereas postrelease performance is influenced by postrelease blog valence and advertising across markets there is more variance in advertising and blog valence postrelease elasticities than there is in blog volume prerelease elasticities we identify the top  markets in terms of their elasticities to each of these  instruments further we classify markets in terms of their sensitivities across these  instruments to identify the most sensitive markets that studios can target with their limited release strategies finally we characterize the extent to which studios could have improved their limited release strategies by identifying the overlap between the actual release markets and the most responsive ones at the time of first release we find that studios cover only  of the most responsive advertising markets and  of the most responsive markets to prerelease blog volume in their limited release strategies implying considerable room for improvement if these were the only metrics to assess those strategies keywords consumer generated media social media online word of mouth blogs advertising motion pictures endogeneity instrumental variables suggested citation suggested
