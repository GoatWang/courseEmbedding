which details the resistance of catholic tradition led by the late bishop de castro mayer and his faithful priests against modernism in the diocese of campos brazil in addition to his book dr allen white is a professor of literature at the united states naval academy in annapolis md and also gives occasional lectures at st thomas aquinas seminary in winona mn many of which have been recorded are available via wwwstasaudioorg my brothers in christ and my friends with great sorrow i read today that you are now considered perfectly inserted in the holy roman catholic apostolic church i never knew you left during those memorable days when i visited you in  while doing research for my book on your great and honored bishop antonio de castro mayer i had the privilege of witnessing the catholic life of your diocese the most perfect embodiment of the catholic life in a contemporary setting which i have ever witnessed and so much more than i could ever imagine what a blessing you have been granted what extraordinary graces you have received undoubtedly through the prayers and sacrifices and work of the unique bishop who tended the flock of campos as shepherd for so many decades in what way were you not then catholic in what way were you separated from the church your announcement that the holy father has signed a letter of entrance welcoming you in full ecclesial communion along with the catholic faithful you assist suggests that there had been some separation with rome that you were in fact in some sort of schism had not the catholic faith been handed down intact and in perfect fullness from our lord jesus christ through his apostles and through the bishops of his church until it came to be passed throughout the diocese of campos in our time by the fully catholic bishop antonio de castro mayer what did he teach you which was not catholic where did he lead you that left you separated from rome and thus needing to return the sad fact is clear even though the details are not yet fully revealed you have signed an agreement with modernist rome and thereby turned your back on the great legacy of your great and beloved bishop who left you in april of  left you because god called him home left you secure and catholic and well provided for his legacy has now been compromised through the compromise which must have been made with the current power players in modernist and progressive rome distinct and separate itself from eternal rome to affect a compromise one must assume leaving ones position and moving toward a middle ground the position you must leave is the fullness of the tradition of the catholic faith the new position you must reach is closer to the outskirts of the new rome the rome of bureaucrats and ambiguous talk and ecumenism and collegiality and religious liberty all the temptations and errors against which your good pastor so courageously and so comprehensively warned and instructed you alexander solzhenitsyn in his memorable and insightful address at the harvard commencement ceremonies in  stated that a decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outsider observer notices in the west in our days for many years the name of the diocese of campos has brought to catholic souls battling error and decay in their own parishes the clear and resounding call to catholic courage in our apostate times perseverance becomes an act of courage the colossal moral and spiritual stature of the small human man who was your bishop stood as a model for catholic courage do you now cut his memory and legacy down to merely human size will the name of campos no longer loudly ring with courage but echo distantly with compromise who can doubt your discomfort or not sympathize with the loneliness you must have felt over the years a small group of priests organized together as the priestly society of st jean marie vianney carrying on the work of mother church in isolation unnoticed ignored except when vilified by the voices of those who long ago made their compromises but what could be more indicative of your true role as alter christi if not your work in loneliness and sorrow with those mocking and derisive voices assailing you to imagine yourselves now inserted in the holy roman catholic apostolic church is no solution you may have a few moments in bonhomie with red and scarlet and purple in the cool marble palaces of the eternal city but will tradition continue in the diocese of campos after the compromising and celebrating how have all other traditional groups fared once they have put themselves under the sway of modernist rome i will not give you the litany of loss and change for you are already aware of it i will just ask you where is the traditional bishop promised to the fraternity of st peter fourteen years ago are the prelates in modernist rome to be trusted will they deliver to you on the promises they have made i quote the wise solzhenitsyn again should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end you have announced that in a solemn ceremony to be held in the cathedral of the most holy savior by his eminence cardinal dario castrillon prefect of the holy congregation for the clergy in the name of the holy father the pope on the th january there will be a reading of documents and the singing of the te deum the th of january also begins the week of prayer for christian unity decreed by rome which will culminate in the day of prayer for peace in assisi on january th the second such ecumenical outrage in recent years a kind of gathering condemned as you well know by earlier popes bishop antonio de castro mayer in a joint statement with archbishop marcel lefebvre spoke with the voice of roman catholic tradition in condemning the gathering of religions at assisi in october of  sic the event actually occurred in  the first such outrageous ecumenical prayer venture have you forgotten his wise and proscriptive words will you now join your hands in prayer with modernist rome as it openly violates the first commandment of god and prays with lutherans and anglicans and muslims and deists and animists in defiance of catholic tradition and then will you pretend still to be traditionalists have you forgotten your own words when in your public profession of faith in  you rejected the ecumenism that makes the faith grow cold and makes us forget our catholic identity seeking to negate the antagonism between light and darkness between christ and belial  you may protest that you will maintain traditionalism in your diocese that you will still celebrate the mass of all time and teach the old catechisms and carry on in the traditional ways but do you not understand that in compromising you accept an absurd contradiction an illogical proposition that any sane mind must condemn  that mother church in her divine authority can teach contradictory ideas at different times and pretend they are both true how can your traditionalism coexist with modernism how can the mass of all time be equivalent with the newfangled human contrivance how can catholics be forbidden from ecumenical prayer at one time and then encouraged in such actions at a later time as hamlet says when staring at the skull of yorick the gorge rises at it such a stark and deadly affront to reason is horrifying are you now willing to play this absurd modernist game with modernist rome many weary and troubled catholics will feel the weight of your decision already the remarks are circulating that you have sold out and caved in and given up the truth is you have abandoned reason may i remind you of the words of a prayer you have often prayed sicut erat in principio et nunc et semper et in saecula saeculorum  as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end in his courageous statement of june   in econe on the occasion of the consecration of traditional bishops by archbishop marcel lefebvre your courageous bishop antonio de castro mayer in his message of support and unity spoke the following words it is sorrowful to see the lamentable blindness of so many confreres in the episcopacy and the priesthood who do not see or who do not wish to see the present crisis in order to be faithful to the mission which god has confided to us to resist the modernism at present ruling you no longer wish to see the present crisis you no longer wish to resist the modernism at present ruling by your action of compromise with the modernism at present ruling you have increased the sorrow of your great bishop you have increased the sorrow of your devoted friends our lord in his agony in the garden certainly suffered from the hatred of his enemies but such suffering was nothing compared to the certain knowledge that he would be betrayed and denied by his friends and disciples be assured of my prayers in christ david allen white       sspxorg š

articles      dostoevsky and the mystery of russia by david allen white  fall  the novel is the baby of the major  literary forms the lyric poem stretches back to the homeric hymns and the psalms the epic to homer drama prizes were being distributed in athens in the fifth century bc and the short story is as old as the myth the fables of aesop and the parables of our lord jesus christ not surprisingly a master of the short narrative given his larger creation the novel however rises out of a potent combination of the printing press the dawn of the industrial revolution the rise of the middle class and an increase in leisure time the new reader with some time on his hands and some pocket money quite reasonably wanted to read about what he knew best ­ himself the novel thus is born in realism and becomes the place where the writer captures or recreates the details of recognizable worlds the first acclaimed and successful popular novel and perhaps still the greatest is cervantes don quixote  the dusty roads the inns the mountains the cheese and the bread and the rusty armor all are rooted in a reality new to literature cervantes great novel established another significant defining element of the novel at its inception the early novels were comic in nature examining a real world they of necessity were social many of the early novels depicted the usual social dance of love and marriage work and play gain and loss even the hugely popular robinson crusoe  looked at the attempt to build a little world of ones own on a desert island comedys central concern is the tension between individuals and the society in which they attempt to live and such tensions rooted the novel in a recognizable but artistically shaped real social order not until the eighteenth century in france did the novel take a turn down more shadowy lanes perhaps because the french knew in their deepest being the dark possibilities of social disruption their novelists turned the comic dance of the novel into a more solemn walk novels such as manon lescaut  and les liaisons dangereuses  begin to direct the movement of the novel down darker and more haunted paths the nineteenth century saw the haunted darkness expand in the gothic novel and the novel of unfulfilled romance the novel seemed capable of exploring all possibilities of human experience and new perspectives opened up most importantly the perspective of the tragic tragedy is the rara avis among literary forms the grandest and most powerful of visions tragedy is the most difficult to capture greece in the fifth century bc england at the turn of the seventeenth century france in the latter part of the seventeenth century all produced tragedy but the nineteenth century saw tragedy move into new forms the opera or music drama and the novel america produced one great tragic novel melvilles moby dick  when the last golden arch falls into the dust and the last video or computer screen goes blank america will be remembered for two astonishing accomplishments ­ the placing of a man on the moon the result of our great science and engineering skills and our great wealth and a novel about a mad sea captain and a white whale the product of our troubled spiritual foundations tragedy in the novel reached its apotheosis in the nineteenth century in russia in the works of those two giants of the long fiction form count leo tolstoy and fyodor dostoevsky tolstoy certainly possessed great genius and his accomplishments are remarkable his influence cannot necessarily be called beneficial however his great epictragic novel war and peace serves up a vision of history firmly in line with contemporary philosophical thought tolstoys view of history denies the great man theory of history and operating in line with hegelian principles presents history as an inevitable flow of events the great man in the novel napoleon by trying to impose his own will on events is crushed by the forces of inevitable movement while the wise old russian general kutuzov observes the pattern of the sweep of change and accommodates himself to it thus securing victory the greatness of tolstoys vision lies not in his illustration of recent theories but in his creation of the world of russia in the napoleonic wars the soirees the battles the landscape the first love of natasha the courage of andrei the questions of pierre tolstoys greatest tragic vision lies in anna karenina a profound moral tragedy this masterwork also provides insight into tolstoys christian vision he believed himself a christian and spoke the language of christianity but with a restricted vocabulary tolstoys christianity is grounded in forgiveness charity virtue brotherhood and peace it is a vision stripped of the supernatural this is the reason that tolstoy became so important to the peace movements of the midtwentieth century his views strongly influenced men such as gandhi and martin luther king jr the crux of this vision of action attaches man only to earth no transcendent spirituality or drama of eternal salvation informs the work dostoevskys works bubble over with lifeanddeath struggles of suffering and loss salvation and damnation born in  he did not come as did most other major russian writers of the century from the landed gentry his father an authoritarian figure worked as a doctor in a small town his mother a devout woman had an enormous influence on her children in his later days he stated i came from a pious russian family in our family we knew the gospel almost from the cradle his mother read him the gospels as well as the lives of the saints the tales permeated his imagination from his earliest years a single episode from his childhood provided another defining moment in his faith the family would leave the small town where his father worked to vacation in the countryside on one such vacation the young dostoevsky was walking in the woods when he heard voices shouting that a wolf was loose in the area the young boy terrified began trying to retrace his steps but found himself lost in the woods he saw a peasant plowing a field in the distance and ran toward him the man smiled and comforted the boy pointed him toward home and reassured him by saying his eye would remain on the youngster all the way to the boys home the peasant then said now christ be with you now go and he made the sign of the cross over the child afterward crossing himself dostoevsky remembered that he returned home with a feeling of complete security he went to study at a militaryengineering school even though from his earliest days he hoped to be a writer his father insisted that he receive a sciencebased education and the young man complied with his fathers wishes he proved to be an adequate student in a curriculum that along with the science and engineering studies included religion history architecture russian language and literature french language and literature german language and literature portrait drawing and art history he immersed himself in the popular ideas of the day and read heavily in the great romantic writers ­ schiller hugo balzac his first publication being a translation of balzacs eugenie grandet he absorbed a theory of german philosopher and romantic aesthetician friedrich schelling who taught him that art is a means of metaphysical cognition the means by which the highest transcendent truths are revealed to mankind he imagined himself as an artist with a high calling and saw his art as possessing a high mission for the good of the russian people he served his time in the military and then decided to pursue his lifes ambition to become a writer his first novel poor folk  received very positive reviews as it powerfully stirred up compassion for the disadvantaged being in line with the social concerns of the day by  he had begun to associate himself with the petrashevski group in st petersburg young intellectuals devoted to the study and implementation of the ideas of the french utopian socialists the socialist movement in st petersburg consisted of two separate wings those who based their ideas on christian principles of assisting the poor and downtrodden and the atheist faction who abandoned any mention of christianity claiming its adherents had done nothing over the centuries to improve social conditions dostoevsky felt himself torn between the two groups longing to be intellectually radical but possessed of a heart shaped by the gospel reading and saints lives from his childhood in  the group was arrested and charged with having read banned material and setting up a printing press to distribute controversial and forbidden material dostoevsky was condemned to death with the others the morning of the execution wearing the hoods on their heads and hearing the guns cocked they learned that their sentences had been commuted to exile and imprisonment in siberia the arrival at the prison in siberia returned his thoughts to his childhood outside the walls women who had followed their husbands into exile waited and watched they pleaded with the officers to free the new prisoners and when their requests were refused the women handed copies of the new testament to the prisoners and making the sign of the cross in the direction of the inmates called out blessings on them dostoevsky absorbed the new testament in prison he also learned an important life lesson earlier in a letter to his brother mikhail he had written man is an enigma this enigma must be solved and if you spend all your life at it dont say you have wasted your time i occupy myself with this enigma because i wish to be a man part of the enigma clarified for him during his prison years he discovered that not all the underprivileged were highminded or good many were degenerate scum he rejected the noble peasant idea found in most of tolstoys writing and realized men must be judged one by one on their individual merits social class could not be used as a key to defining character he also learned from experience something about the savage nature of human beings through observation of his fellow prisoners he saw that we are disordered creatures subject to outbursts of irrational passions and destructive action the more the individual personality was confined and controlled the more subject it became to these frenetic explosions of willfulness part of this turbulence could be defined as a desire of the individual will to express its own freedom human freedom had a compulsive need to demonstrate its own existence dostoevskys great biographer joseph frank puts the idea this way to fulfill this drive men will sacrifice all other goods and values and if they are unable to satisfy it in any way the results can be disastrous dostoevsky himself proved this disastrous freedom by making a bad marriage in  and giving in to his temptation for gambling a vice that haunted him for his entire life but did produce his brilliant dissection of the addiction the gambler he also came to be afflicted with epilepsy he distanced himself from his old friends as his political views became more and more conservative he saw clearly that man does not above all need material well being in this world but rather spiritual redemption what christ taught mankind he now knew was that salvation can come only through suffering man must be ready to share the sufferings of christ in order to find salvation in a world increasingly absorbed with progress and utopias and comfort dostoevsky shouts no christ lives and what he teaches us is that we must suffer such belief could be neither easy nor constant in the modern world i will tell you that i am a child of the century a child of disbelief and doubt i will remain so until the grave how much terrible torture this thirst for faith has cost me and costs me even now which is all the stronger in my soul the more arguments i can find against it and yet god sends me sometimes instants when i am completely calm at those instants i love and feel loved by others and it is at those instants that i have shaped for myself a credo where everything is clear and sacred to me this credo is very simple here it is to believe that nothing is more beautiful profound sympathetic reasonable manly and perfect than christ and i tell myself with a jealous love that not only is there nothing more but there can be nothing more even more if someone proved to me that christ is outside the truth and that in reality the truth were outside of christ then i should prefer to remain with christ rather than with the truth  joseph frank summarizes dostoevskys view of modern man in this way not to believe in christ and immortality is to be condemned to live in a senseless universe and the characters in his great novels who reach this level of selfawareness inevitably destroy themselves because by refusing to endure the torment of living without hope they have become monsters in their misery this great struggle between belief and disbelief informs all the great novels from notes from underground through the brothers karamazov after nursing his wife through her fatal illness and then losing his beloved brother mikhail dostoevsky was granted the grace of a devoted second wife anna grigoryevna snitkina hired to be his secretary she became his spiritual consolation he dictated to her the vast fictional canvases on which an array of recognizable human souls struggle with grand passions and high ideas dmitri karamazov says god and the devil are fighting and the battlefield is the heart of man the novels of dostoevsky come closer to the core of the modern dilemma than any other body of modern literature and his knowledge of human beings is the keenest in art since shakespeare but some great artists may also be graced by god with another gift some artists have oracular flashes offering up profound prophetic pronouncements such instances stretch from the vision of vergil in his fourth eclogue  bc which suggests the coming of our lord as a child who will bring a reign of peace to a troubled world to the chilling example of the japanese man in strindbergs play the great highway  who announces that he is named for his native town hiroshima just before he steps into a furnace and is incinerated no artist ever set down more accurate prophetic pronouncements than dostoevsky in his great novel about the revolutionary movement demons  dostoevsky accurately predicted not only the coming of socialism to holy mother russia as he termed his country but also the devastating consequences at more than one point in the novel he has characters pronounce the cold fact that the revolution will triumph by radically lopping off a hundred million heads shigalyov the character presenting the plan admits a problem for starting from unlimited freedom i conclude with unlimited despotism dostoevsky seemed to witness the abyss into which his country would descend in the twentieth century he combines his vision of the nightmare looming over russia with the incident of the gadarene swine from the gospel of luke a passage he uses as one of the epigraphs for the novel he again quotes the passage from luke when a character in the novel sofya matveevna ulitin a woman who travels from town to town passing out gospels reads the words at the request of the dying liberal professor stepan trofimovich verkhovensky the man whose soft socialist teaching has unleashed the demons in the next generation after hearing the passage the dying professor says terribly many thoughts occur to me now you see its exactly like our russia these demons who come out of a sick man and enter into the swine ­ its all the sores all the miasmas all the uncleanness all the big and little demons accumulated in our great and sick man in our russia for centuries for centuries oui cette russie que jaimais toujours but a great will and a great thought will descend to her from on high as upon that insane demoniac and out will come all these demons all the uncleanness all the abomination that is festering on the surfaceand they will beg of themselves to enter into swine and perhaps they already have it is us us and them and petrushaet les autres avec lui and i perhaps first at the head and we will rush insane and raging from the cliff down into the sea and all be drowned and good riddance to us because thats the most were fit for  russia is presented as a possessed madman out of whom demons will rush infect others and push multitudes of those so possessed into destruction the connection with our ladys message to the shepherd children at fatima on the eve of the russian revolution is unmistakable russia will spread her errors throughout the world dostoevsky makes many catholic readers uncomfortable in many of his novels he rails against the catholic church his knowledge of the catholic church however came largely from the french socialists who had such a profound influence on him in his youth dostoevsky viewed the catholic church as an institution that had abandoned its spiritual beliefs in a quest to give mankind earthly happiness he has the catholic grand inquisitor state to christ in the brothers karamazov you promised them heavenly bread but i repeat again can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak eternally depraved and eternally ignoble human race dostoevsky related his sense of how the catholic social preoccupation worked the catholic priest searches out some miserable workers family and gains their confidence he feeds them all gives them clothes provides heating looks after the sick buys medicine becomes the friend of the family and converts them to catholicism this sense of the socially obsessed catholic church which places earthly comfort before redemptive suffering and peace on earth before peace of soul must make any postvatican ii catholic uncomfortable in its precision the only error when applied to the novus ordo church is that the priest would no longer attempt to convert the family the sentimental socialism of the nineteenthcentury french intellectuals whom dostoevsky came to despise found a happy home in the postconciliar church with his insistence on suffering and salvation the supernatural and sacrifice dostoevsky echoes many of the teachings of the catholic church with his prophetic vision of a possessed russia unleashing her demons into the world he echoes the prophecies of fatima and not only those prophecies that already come to fruition the above quoted words from the deathbed of stepan trofimovich verkhovensky in demons conclude with the following remarks but the sick man will be healed and sit at the feet of jesusand everyone will look in amazement dear vous comprenez apres but it excites me very much now vous comprenez apres nous comprendrons ensemble russia will be healed russia will sit at the feet of our savior and the whole world will be amazed in the end my immaculate heart will triumph russia will be converted and a period of peace will be granted to mankind heaven granted this man a modernist a tormented doubter a gambler and epileptic a foe of socialistic catholicism a novelist a glimpse of the fatima prophecies before heaven chose to reveal them to the world a fact that presents us with mysteries as to the nature of art and the will of god in his final novel the brothers karamazov  dostoevsky has the wise elder father zossima on the brink of the grave say this star the image of christ will shine forth from the east the same promise has been given us by our lady and we who suffer here in the maelstrom of the modern atheistic materialistic world still await that glorious
