comprised of three parts – intelisocket meters inteligateways and the intelinetwork these work seamlessly together to give you realtime data and control over your electrical equipment intelisocket™ intelisockets are the local energy meters and control points they easily plug in between your equipment and the wall sockets learn more inteligateway™ inteligateways are the connection points between intelisockets and the intelinetwork they securely handle all communications between the two learn more intelinetwork™ the intelinetwork is a cloudbased reporting and control dashboard it provides advanced data visualization scheduling and configuration capabilities learn more inteligateway™  ibis networks home ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login inteligateway™ the ibis inteligateway is the central connection point between the intelisockets and the intelinetwork as the intelisocket mesh network reports energy usage data on devices every  seconds the inteligateway collects all the reports and passes them along to the cloudbased intelinetwork in real time the inteligateway also takes commands from the intelinetwork for powering devices updown and passes those commands along to the correct intelisockets then confirms the response to the intelinetwork along with plug load data the inteligateway sends information about its health and internal state this data feeds into the intelinetwork’s alert system and can be immediately broadcast to support technicians if a situation arises that needs attention the inteligateway adapts to local environmental issues to robustly deliver plug load data from each socket to the intelinetwork the inteligateway aggregates and caches plug load data in the case of connectivity problems and easily accommodates being disconnected for up to  minutes the inteligateway automatically restarts after a power outage and has internal sensors that can identify an error state automatically restarting when the error is nonrecoverable bms integration the inteligateway can also be configured to communicate with building management systems bms that support bacnet ip communications this provides twoway data and command control between the intelinetwork system and the bms this allows companies to use a bms for holistic and coordinated building controls while still taking advantage of the data reporting and other tools in the cloudbased intelinetwork part no image rf range rf transmit power data sheet ig m dbm inteligateway   intelisocketintelinetwork   schools and higher education  ibis networks home ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login schools and higher education in schools there are many opportunities to use the ibis intelinetwork to provide insight and save money typical equipment that schools have had success with include computers charging carts refrigerators kitchen equipment water coolers and fountains projectors window ac units copiers and printers space heaters schools consume enormous amounts of energy every year k schools spend over  billion on energy  more than they spend on textbooks and computers combined however energy star estimates that at least   billion of this is wasted for most schools  of the total electricity is consumed by plug load  all the equipment computers refrigerators projectors etc that are plugged in around campus with ibis schools can take control of this consumption and dramatically reduce this energy cost these savings can be spent on education deferred maintenance and other important needs how ibis saves energy and money in schools using a holistic approach that employs multiple strategies can save a school upwards of  on its overall electricity bill key strategies that ibis intelinetwork systems enable include schedules shut down equipment when spaces are unoccupied and ensure that devices such as heaters fans and air conditioners aren’t accidentally left on device health know when to repair or replace equipment extending life of equipment eg refrigerators informed policies create and enforce behavioral policies such as powering down unused computers that encourage energy savings time shifting charge or run equipment like charging carts during offpeak hours to save money alerts get alerts when key equipment is on or off when it should not be additionally the intelinetwork can be used to further work force development and student engagement contact ibis home  ibis networks home ibis system markets support

networks home ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login intelinetwork™ as the heart of the system the intelinetwork is the primary interface and tool for viewing analyzing reporting and managing your building’s plug load data the ibis intelinetwork is a cloudbased service that provides reporting scheduling data analytics and system management tools the highly intuitive yet powerful system allows users to identify opportunities for energy and demand reduction implement energy management strategies through device scheduling and monitoring and track savings in real time the intelinetwork is accessible from any connected device and is built from the groundup to support mobile devices tablets and other devices dashboard users can configure the intelinetwork to provide targeted highvalue information at a glance the dashboard provides office workers with individualized access allowing them to control sockets in their personal workspace provide technical support staff with uptodate access to device health information and realtime notifications and ensure that financial people always have uptodate data on energy use and savings   reporting the core of any energy management strategy is detailed energy usage data the intelinetwork software displays historical data at granularities as fine as one minute and as coarse as multiple days the dynamic display allows one to look at short time intervals at extremely fine detail as easily as summary data for years at a time usage data can be split up by individual sockets or grouped by location or device type whichever way the data is aggregated it can be displayed in a stacked format to show the components of the total energy usage or in a sidebyside format to compare energy use from one socket to another one device type to another or from one location to another     scheduling metadata and analytical calculations can be overlaid on the data display to contextualize the data and highlight derived data attributes that can inform energy strategies analytical results can also be used to estimate savings of potential device schedules   alerts a flexible and extensible alerting system provides immediate notification of highpriority error conditions as well as regular summary reports of system activity notifications and reports can be routed to email and sms according to priority and content administrative tools a finegrained permissions system limits data visibility by user according to location and device type separate permissions independently control what data a user can view and which socket the user has control over control of critical devices can be globally disallowed   inteligatewaycontact ibis   office buildings  ibis networks home ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login ibis system markets support about intelinetwork login office buildings offices are diverse environments but there are many common devices where ibis can help computers copiers and printers space heaters water coolersheatersfountains projectors kitchen equipment displays and lobby equipment most office buildings are empty over  of the time including nights and weekends but much of the equipment inside continues to run  equipment like water coolers space heaters printers copiers vending machines and refrigerators all use energy when no one is around even in powersaving mode the total energy wasted by all this equipment adds up in fact “plug load” equipment comprises  of a building’s overall electricity usage but building managers have no tools to manage or even understand this huge demand in addition without active monitoring and data on the equipment energy usage it is impossible to know if the devices are performing at their best or even energy efficient in the first place with ibis networks you finally get realtime data on energy usage for every piece of equipment easytouse controls to implement power schedules and policies and alerts to keep you in control all delivered through an intuitive cloudbased dashboard it even can integrate with your bacnet building management system how ibis saves energy and money in office buildings office buildings that take an active management approach to plug load can save up to  on managed devices which translates into  off the overall electricity bill key strategies that ibis intelinetwork systems enable include schedules easily create dynamic schedules to power down equipment when the office is empty the ibis system can be used to set schedules by department location type or even for each individual device device health energy usage can be a predictor of device health erratic or excessive energy use often precedes device failure using ibis realtime data you can see which equipment needs maintenance or replacement before it fails informed policies use trend and energy cost data to optimize user behavior policies for example turning off computers or lobby equipment can increase savings quickly alerts get notified when equipment is on or off when it should not be for mission critical equipment this can be more valuable than the other benefits combined
