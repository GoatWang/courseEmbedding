clients to provide solutions that might benefit individual and institutional clients alike growth is being driven by investor demand for strategies and asset classes that can diversify portfolios through income streams less correlated to equity and fixed income investments in working with clients olden lane generally classifies alternative investment return streams into two categories access products delivering exposure to a specific asset class or risk factor — for example many of today’s investors are interested in accessing the return streams of asset classes traditionally beyond the reach of all but the most sophisticated investors outcome products targeting a specific return unattainable though a traditional equity or fixed income investment — for example an investor may desire an enhanced level of equity market upside or some protection against downside loss next our target outcome funds   olden lane’s target outcome funds bring a new combination of capability and convenience to portfolio and risk management this new family of innovative funds provides investors a broad set of alternatives to build more robust and resilient portfolios each target outcome fund allows investors to participate in the return of a benchmark market index or other reference asset over a certain period of time and within specific risk constraints these funds generally offer some measure of principal protection in exchange for a limit on participation in price appreciation some funds may also include features that leverage a particular return profile in all cases target outcome funds are designed to provide an investor with the means to target an investment outcome aligned with hisher objectives and risk tolerance target outcome funds are designed to reduce the risk and uncertainty inherent in the capital markets the range of outcomes over a certain interval of time is defined when the fund is brought to market the outcome orientation of these funds brings a new dimension to the rapidly growing market for index investing  in a target outcome fund the uncertainty of an unconstrained allocation is replaced by a confidence in a controlled allocation target outcome funds encourage investors to consider how both positive and negative markets might affect their portfolios allowing for better planning and portfolio management products  offerings next new

charge and waiver of deferred sales charge under certain circumstances  applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit one or more series to impose a sales charge on a deferred basis ‘‘dsc’’ for each series the depositor would set a maximum sales charge per unit a portion of which may be collected ‘‘up front’’ ie at the time an investor purchases the units the dsc would be collected subsequently in installments ‘‘installment payments’’ as described in the application the depositor would not add any amount for interest or any similar or related charge to adjust for such

of units sold with a frontend sales charge a dsc or both  a unitholder who purchases units under the exchange option or rollover option would pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the units by a new investor the reduced sales charge will be reasonably related to the expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the dsc program which may include an amount that will fairly and adequately compensate the depositor and participating underwriters and brokers for their services in providing the dsc program applicants’ legal analysis a dsc and waiver of dsc  section  of the act defines a ‘‘unit investment trust’’ as an investment company that issues only redeemable securities section a of the act defines a ‘‘redeemable security’’ as a security that upon its presentation to the issuer entitles the holder to receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuer’s current net assets or the cash equivalent of those assets rule c– under the act requires that the price of a redeemable security issued by a registered investment company for purposes of sale redemption or repurchase be based on the security’s current net asset value ‘‘nav’’ because the collection of any unpaid dsc may cause a redeeming unitholder to receive an amount less than the nav of the redeemed units applicants request relief from section a and rule c–  section d of the act and rule d– under the act require a registered investment company and its principal underwriter and dealers to sell securities only at the current public offering price described in the investment company’s prospectus with the exception of sales of redeemable securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in the sales load section a of the act defines the term ‘‘sales load’’

intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section c applicants state that the provisions of section d are intended to prevent a riskless trading in investment company securities due to backward pricing b disruption of orderly distribution by dealers selling shares at a discount and c discrimination among investors resulting from different prices charged to different investors applicants assert that the proposed dsc program will present none of these abuses applicants further state that all scheduled variations in the sales load will be disclosed in the prospectus of each series and applied uniformly to all investors and that applicants will comply with all the conditions set forth in rule d–  section ac of the act in relevant part prohibits a trustee or custodian of a uit from collecting from the trust as an expense any payment to the trust’s depositor or principal underwriter because the series custodian’s payment of the dsc to the depositor may be deemed to be an expense under section ac applicants request relief under section c from section ac to the extent necessary to permit the series custodian to collect installment payments and disburse them to the depositor applicants submit that the relief is appropriate because the dsc is more properly characterized as a sales load b exchange option and rollover option  sections a and c of the act prohibit any offer of exchange by a uit for the securities of another investment company unless the terms of the offer have been approved in advance by the commission applicants request an order under sections a and c for commission approval of the exchange option and the rollover option c net worth requirement  section a of the act requires that a registered investment company have  of net worth prior to making a public offering applicants verdate sep  apr   jkt  state that each series will comply with this requirement because the depositor will deposit more than  of securities applicants assert however that the commission has interpreted section a as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment applicants state that under this interpretation a series would not satisfy section a because of the depositor’s intention to sell all the units of the series

at which the system will automatically move their quotation following an execution that exhausts the size of their existing quotation as  the term ‘‘market makers’’ refers to ‘‘competitive market makers’’ and ‘‘primary market makers’’ collectively see rule a  tickworse functionality is not currently memorialized in the exchange’s rulebook in addition the exchange will not offer tickworse on

release no  january    fr  january   sr–ise–– the exchange imported rule  from ise’s rulebook when the commission granted the exchange’s application for registration as a national securities exchange

is traded out it can be automatically reinstated into the exchange’s order book at the next best price this optional feature is intended to help market makers meet their continuous quoting obligations under the exchange’s rules  when their displayed quotations are exhausted when a market maker’s quote is traded out and automatically reinstated into the exchange’s order book using the tickworse functionality the reinstated quote will be given priority pursuant to the exchange’s split price priority rule as discussed below due to the lack of demand for the tickworse feature the exchange proposes to decommission the use of this functionality as it migrates symbols to inet no later than in  q as discussed above the exchange offers the tickworse feature as a voluntary tool for market makers to assist them in meeting their continuous quoting obligations under the exchange’s rules as such market makers are not required to use the exchangeprovided functionality and can program their own systems to perform the same functions if they prefer the exchange has found that almost all market makers use their own systems rather than the exchange’s tickworse feature to send refreshed quotations when their displayed quotations are exhausted and therefore members have discontinued use of this functionality because the tickworse functionality is currently not memorialized in the exchange’s rules as noted above there is no text of the proposed rule change the exchange will provide advance notice to its members through an options trader alert of the intent to decommission the tickworse functionality february   order granting registration as a national securities exchange  market makers may choose to set tickworse parameters by specifying how many price ticks back and for what size the quote is to be reinstated  specifically primary market makers ‘‘pmms’’ are required under rule e to enter quotations in all of the series listed on the exchange of the options classes to which they are appointed on a daily basis supplementary material  to rule  further requires pmms to quote  of the time their assigned options class is open for trading on the exchange as provided in rule e competitive market makers ‘‘cmms’’ are not required to enter quotations in the options class to which they are appointed but in the event a cmm does initiate quoting such cmm is generally required to quote  of the time its assigned options class is open for trading on the exchange  currently this functionality is being used by one market maker on the exchange  the exchange notes that

compliance with rule d under the act in certain circumstances which are disclosed in the series prospectus  the depositor may but is not legally obligated to maintain a secondary market for units of an outstanding series other broker dealers may or may not maintain a secondary market for units of a series if a secondary market is maintained investors will be able to purchase units on the secondary market at the current public offering price plus a frontend sales charge if such a market is not maintained at any time for any series holders of the units unitholders of that series may redeem their units through the series custodian a deferred sales charge and waiver of deferred sales charge under certain circumstances  applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit

an investor purchases the units the dsc would be collected subsequently in installments installment payments as described in the application the depositor would not add any amount for interest or any similar or related charge to adjust for such deferral  when a unitholder redeems or sells units the depositor intends to deduct any unpaid dsc from the redemption or sale proceeds when calculating the amount due the depositor will assume that units on which the dsc has been paid in full are redeemed or sold first with respect to units on which the dsc has not been paid in full the depositor will assume that the units held for the longest time are redeemed or sold first applicants represent that the dsc collected at the time of redemption or sale together with the installment payments and any

option and unitholders of a series that is terminating to exchange their units for units of a new series of the same type rollover option the exchange option and rollover option would apply to all exchanges of units sold with a frontend sales charge a dsc or both  a unitholder who purchases units under the exchange option or rollover option would pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the units by a new investor the reduced sales charge will be reasonably related to the expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the dsc program which may include an amount that will fairly and adequately compensate the depositor and participating underwriters and brokers for their services in providing the dsc program applicants legal analysis a dsc and waiver of dsc  section  of the act defines a unit investment trust as an investment company that issues only redeemable securities section a of the act defines a redeemable security as a security that upon its presentation to the issuer entitles the holder to receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent of those assets rule c under the act requires that the price of a redeemable security issued by a registered investment company for purposes of sale redemption or repurchase be based on the securitys current net asset value nav because the collection of any unpaid dsc may cause a redeeming unitholder to receive an amount less than the nav of the redeemed units applicants request relief from section a and rule c  section d of the act and rule d under the act require a registered investment company and its principal underwriter and dealers to sell securities only at the current public offering price described in the investment companys prospectus with the exception of sales of redeemable securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in the sales load section a of the act defines the term sales load as the

public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section c applicants state that the provisions of section d are intended to prevent a riskless trading in investment company securities due to backward pricing b disruption of orderly distribution by dealers selling shares at a discount and c discrimination among investors resulting from different prices charged to different investors applicants assert that the proposed dsc program will present none of these abuses applicants further state that all scheduled variations in the sales load will be disclosed in the prospectus of each series and applied uniformly to all investors and that applicants will comply with all the conditions set forth in rule d  section ac of the act in relevant part prohibits a trustee or custodian of a uit from collecting from the trust as an expense any payment to the trusts depositor or principal underwriter because the series custodians payment of the dsc to the depositor may be deemed to be an expense under section ac applicants request relief under section c from section ac to the extent necessary to permit the series custodian to collect installment payments and disburse them to the depositor applicants submit that the relief is appropriate because the dsc is more properly characterized as a sales load b exchange option and rollover option  sections a and c of the act prohibit any offer of exchange by a uit for the securities of another investment company unless the terms of the offer have been approved in advance by the commission applicants request an order under sections a and c for commission approval of the exchange option and the rollover option c net worth requirement  section a of the act requires that a registered investment company have  of net worth prior to making a public offering applicants state that each series will comply with this requirement because the depositor will deposit more than  of securities applicants assert however that the commission has interpreted section a as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment applicants state that under this interpretation a series would not satisfy section a because of the depositors intention to sell all the units of the series  rule a under the act exempts uits from section a if certain conditions are met one of which is that the uit invest only in

section b of the act and rule b under the act provide that except under limited circumstances no registered investment company may distribute longterm gains more than once every twelve months rule bc under certain circumstances exempts a uit investing in eligible trust securities as defined in rule a from the requirements of rule b because the structured series do not limit their investments to eligible trust securities however the structured series will not qualify for the exemption in paragraph c of rule b applicants therefore request an exemption under section c from section b and rule b

reference index is required to be determined olden lane will instead make the necessary determination by reference to a group of stocks or another index or indices as applicable and will apply a computation methodology that olden lane determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate such reference index � if olden lane determines that any index constituents or the method of calculating the reference index have been changed at any time in any respect that causes the level of the reference index not to fairly represent the level of that index had such changes not been made or that otherwise affects the calculation of the closing levels of the reference index the trigger level the initial index level the final index level or the final distributions on the termination date then olden lane may make any adjustments in this method of calculating the reference index that it believes are appropriate to ensure that the index level used to determine the amount payable on the termination date is equitable examples of any such changes that may cause olden lane to make the foregoing adjustment include but are not limited to additions deletions or substitutions and any reweighting or rebalancing of the index constituents changes made by the index sponsor under its existing policies or following a modification of those policies changes due to the publication of a

as described below under �selling units�redemption� olden lane shall cause one or both of the options counterparties to unwind the corresponding number of options agreements the options agreements provide that the trust may exercise an unwind on or prior to the close of trading on each business day and that payments will be made to the trust three business days thereafter the actual proceeds realized from the unwind of an options agreement may differ from the evaluator�s determination of the fair value of such options agreements which consider various factors such as the amounts payable in connection with an early unwind of such options agreements by the options counterparty or current prices for the options agreements as may be obtained from dealers or brokers andor prices for comparable options the value of the trust will vary over time based principally on the value of the options agreements and the treasury obligations the value of the options agreements will be driven by the performance of the reference index the terms of the options agreements and factors such as market interest rates the dividend yield of the reference index and the volatility of the reference index the passage of time will also generally influence the value of the options agreements the value of the trust will generally increase when the index level of the reference index rises and decline

remaining trust expenses olden lane will demand payment of any amounts owed by the options counterparties under their respective options agreements and if such payments are not made liquidate any collateral posted by the options counterparties to the trust to secure these payments similarly the options counterparties will demand payment of any amounts owed by the trust and if such payments are not made liquidate any collateral posted by the trust to the options counterparty to secure these payments the termination date of the trust shall also be accelerated to the date determined by olden lane based on receipt of the final liquidation proceeds of the treasury obligations and the final payment under the options agreements and the payment of trust expenses and the trust will distribute the balance of trust property to unitholders � determination of termination payment under the options agreements � should olden lane terminate an options agreement after an options counterparty event occurs olden lane will compute an amount payable under the affected options agreements by reference to the �market quotation� method��generally the �market quotation� method involves the computation of an amount payable by or to the trust based on the solicitation of eligible replacement options counterparties of an amount that would be paid to or by the trust for replacement options transactions having the effect of preserving for the trust the economic equivalent of the terminated options agreements as of the date of the early termination � the trust is structured so that the termination of an options agreement due to a trust options event is unlikely however should such a trust options event occur the determination of market quotation will generally parallel the determination above except that in general the relevant options counterparty will make the �market quotation� computation from its replacement cost perspective rather than from the trust�s replacement cost perspective � payment upon the early termination of any options agreement could result in substantial losses to the unitholders because the evaluator employs fair value to price the options agreements the price used by the evaluator may be materially different from the prices of similar option contracts listed on an exchange and may differ from the price that may be realized upon the actual disposition of the options agreements in addition to such risks if an options counterparty owes an amount to the trust under its options agreement and the collateral posted by such options counterparty is insufficient to cover that amount the trust also faces the risk of nonperformance by the options counterparty as a result the credit risk to any uncollateralized obligation of the options counterparties may result in significant losses � dissolution of the trust � in addition to the events specified in part b of this prospectus under �trust administration  dissolution of the trust� olden lane may direct the dissolution of the trust if due to�a change in law including tax law there is or there is a substantial likelihood that the trust will be prohibited or impaired in any material way from pursuing its principal investment strategy in addition if a default termination event or similar event in respect of the trust occurs and the derivative counterparties direct the termination of the options agreements olden lane will direct the dissolution of the trust � �hypothetical examples � the following table illustrates hypothetical returns for the units based on

exhaustive��whether or not units are a suitable investment will depend on individual circumstances and you should reach an investment decision only after you and your investment legal tax accounting and other advisors have carefully considered the suitability of an investment in light of your particular circumstances��you should also review carefully the �principal risks� beginning on page a of this prospectus part a as well as the �investment risks� section of prospectus part b for risks related to an investment in the trust � a � � �principal risks � as with all investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of units of the trust you should understand these risks before you invest and should reach a decision to invest in the trust only after carefully considering the suitability of such an investment in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this prospectus we urge you to read the additional explanation of risks relating to the units generally in the investment risks section of part b of this prospectus we also urge you to consult your investment legal tax accounting and other advisors before you invest in the units � olden lane makes no recommendation as to the suitability of the units for investment��if the value of the assets in the trust�s portfolio falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective or that a unitholder�s investment return will be positive over any period � the trust is not actively managed the trust is a unit investment trust and as a result is not actively managed trust property is only bought and sold in limited circumstances as described in this prospectus��the trust will generally hold and may continue to buy the same assets even though the market value or yield on such assets may have changed the value of your investment may fall over time � market risk��market risk is the risk that the value of the assets in the trust�s portfolio will fluctuate��this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price��market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in the performance and expected volatility of the reference index its various constituents interest rates and inflation��in addition the value of the trust might be affected by i the dividend rates on the index constituents ii interest and yield rates on the treasury obligations and in the market generally and iii a variety of economic financial political regulatory or judicial events��the trust does not guarantee any return of principal � risk of loss the return on your units on the termination date is linked to the performance of the reference index and will depend on whether and the extent to which the performance of the reference index is positive or negative��on the termination date should the final index level be less than the trigger level you will likely suffer substantial losses on your initial investment� the downside market exposure to the reference index is subject to contingent protection only on the termination date the  per unit minimum distribution feature applies only on the termination date all expected payments are subject to further reductions for expenses � options risk �options agreements are derivative contracts that are based on and are valued in relation to one or more underlying securities financial benchmarks or indices derivatives typically have economic leverage inherent in their terms such leverage will magnify any losses options agreements can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value and changes in the value of such instruments held by the trust may not correlate with the underlying reference index or other trust property although the value of trust�s options agreements will depend largely upon price movements in the underlying reference index there are additional risks associated with options agreements that are possibly greater than the risks associated with investing in other financial instruments that provide economic exposure to the reference index including illiquidity risk leveraging risk and counterparty credit risk a small position in options agreements could have a potentially large impact on the trust�s performance trading restrictions or limitations may be imposed by an exchange and government regulations may restrict trading in options agreements � the final distribution applies only if units are held to the termination date unitholders should plan to hold units to the termination date if a unitholder redeems or is otherwise able to sell units prior to the termination date in the secondary market such a sale may be at a loss relative to the initial investment even if any percentage decline of the reference index from its initial index level is equal to or less than the trigger level � the participation rate applies only if units are held to the termination date unitholders should plan to hold units to the termination date if a unitholder redeems or is otherwise able to sell units prior to the termination date in the secondary market the price of such a sale will likely not reflect the full economic value of the participation rate and the return a unitholder will realize may be less than the index return multiplied by the participation rate even if the index return is positive unitholders can receive the full benefit of the participation rate only if the units are held to the termination date � � a � � the potential return is limited by a maximum gain� the potential return of the units is limited to the maximum gain unitholders will not benefit from any positive return of the reference index in excess of an amount that when multiplied by the participation rate exceeds the maximum gain as a result a unitholder�s��return may be less than a direct investment in the reference index sale of trust property to pay trust expenses��semiannual distributions of interest income from the trust�s investment in the treasury obligations on the securities may be insufficient to meet any or all expenses of the trust��if the cash balances in the income and capital accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts payable by the trust olden lane on behalf of the trust will sell trust property to pay such amounts��sales may result in losses to unitholders and will reduce the principal amount of treasury obligations per unit available on the termination date � counterparty concentration risk �the trust is considered to be concentrated in the treasury obligations options agreements and its exposure to the options counterparties which are both companies in the financial services industry negative developments in the financial services industry may affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment � options counterparty risk��the trust�s ability to achieve its investment objective will depend upon the ability of each options counterparty to meet its obligations an options counterparty may become unable to make a payment due to the trust in connection with its options agreement��moreover if an options counterparty is unable to make a payment when due and the collateral posted by the options counterparty is insufficient the trust will face the risk of nonperformance by the options counterparty and will suffer losses olden lane and the supervisor intend to monitor the collateral accounts and for the occurrence of events which would adversely affect the general credit standing of the options counterparties unitholders should understand that the trust�s portfolio is not actively managed and the trust may continue to hold the options agreements even if these events occur as a result the credit risk of the options counterparties may affect the value of your investment and may result in significant losses � higher purchase price risk� the final distributions on the termination date or otherwise on redemption will not be adjusted based on the price you pay for your units if you purchase units at a price other than  then the return on your investment will differ from and may be substantially less than the return on a unit purchased at  if you purchase a unit at more than  and hold the unit to the termination date the return on your investment or loss thereon will be lower than it would have been for a unit purchased at  in addition the impact of the trigger level on the return on your investment and the extent to which the trigger level will diminish your exposure to any negative reference index performance will depend upon the price you pay for your units relative to a unit purchased at  � dilution risk��as olden lane sells units the size of the trust will increase olden lane will seek to replicate the existing portfolio and when the trust buys treasury obligations and options agreements it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees existing unitholders could experience a dilution of their investment because of these fees and fluctuations in prices between the time olden lane creates units and the time the trust buys trust property unitholders could also experience dilution because of similar fees paid and fluctuations in the prices between the time that olden lane redeems units and sells or unwinds trust property olden lane cannot guarantee that the trust will keep its present size for any length of time � dividend and voting risk unitholders will not have control voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of a direct investment in the index constituents or options agreements would normally have��the reference index does not reflect the payment of dividends on the stocks included in the reference index because of this the return on the units will not be the same as the return you would receive if you were to purchase those stocks and hold them for a period equal to the term of the trust��furthermore a direct investment in the index constituents is likely to have tax consequences that are different from an investment in the trust � treasury obligation risk��no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future �treasury obligations are direct obligations of the united states that are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states �the value of the treasury obligations will be adversely affected by decreases in bond prices and increases in interest rates �certain treasury obligations may have been purchased at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day immediately preceding the trust�s inception date at prices lower than their par � � a � � value at maturity indicating a market discount �certain treasury obligations may have been purchased at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day immediately preceding the trust�s inception date at prices greater than their par value at maturity indicating a market premium �generally the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease �conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium��given today�s historically low interest rate environment risks associated with rising rates are heightened � legislation and litigation risk from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the index constituents��such an initiative may also have a negative impact on the trust�s portfolio or on the tax treatment of your investment in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the index constituents or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities and therefore the level of the reference index no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of any of the index constituents and what the overall affect may be on the value of the trust � liquidity risk��a unitholder may be subject to liquidity risk if olden lane does not maintain a secondary market however a unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market may cause units to be redeemed on any business day by the trust the trust may exercise an unwind right provided under the options agreements in connection with a redemption because the evaluator employs fair value to price the options agreements the price used by the evaluator may be materially different from the prices of similar option contracts listed on an exchange and may differ from the price that may be realized upon the actual disposition of the options agreements � no fdic guarantee an investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency � reference index risk��the return on the trust is expected to depend largely upon the performance of the reference index which consists of  stocks selected to provide a performance benchmark for the us equity markets��the policies of the index sponsor and any changes affecting the reference index or the index constituents could affect the market value of the trust and its units��the policies of the index sponsor concerning the calculation of the levels of the reference index or additions deletions or substitutions of the index constituents and the

here��we urge you to also read the explanation of other specific risks relating to the units in the �risk factors� section of part a of the prospectus we urge you to consult your investment legal tax accounting and other advisors before you invest in the units � the units involve risk this section describes some of the main risks that can impact the value of the trust property you should understand these risks before you invest and should reach a decision to invest in the trust only after carefully considering the suitability of such an investment in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this prospectus you could lose some or all of your investment in the units if the value of the trust property falls the value of your units will also fall olden lane cannot guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period � market risk�market risk is the risk that the value of trust property may fluctuate this could cause a decrease in the value of your units market value may be affected by a variety of factors including � � b � � � � general financial markets movements including changes in prices and volatility of the reference index and other trust property � � � changes in perceptions about the reference index or an issuer of trust property � � � changes in the financial condition of an issuer of trust property � � � interest rates and inflation � � � governmental policies and litigation and � � � purchases and sales of trust property by the trust � even though olden lane oversees the portfolio in consultation with the supervisor you should remember that neither olden lane nor the supervisor manages the trust�s portfolio��the trust will not sell trust property solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund � fixed portfolio�investors should be aware that the trust is not �managed� and as a result the adverse financial condition of trust property will not result in its elimination from the portfolio of the trust except under extraordinary circumstances investors should note in particular that the trust property was selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in part a of the prospectus and that the trust may continue to purchase or hold trust property originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the attractiveness of the trust property may have changed some of the trust property may also be owned by other clients of olden lane however because these clients may have differing investment objectives olden lane may sell identical property from those accounts in instances where a sale by the trust of identical trust property would be impermissible such as to maximize return by taking advantage of market fluctuations � additional deposits and dilution risk�the trust agreement authorizes olden lane to increase the size of the trust and the number of units thereof by the delivery of additional securities or other property or cash including a letter of credit and thereafter purchasing additional securities��if applicable the trust will enter into additional derivative transactions��the transfer agent will deliver a corresponding number of additional units if olden lane deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the trust property between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of additional trust property and because the trust will pay the brokerage fees associated with such purchases��to minimize this effect the trust will attempt to purchase the additional trust property as close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible olden lane cannot guarantee that the trust will keep its size for any length of time � some of the trust property may have limited trading volume olden lane will endeavor to purchase additional trust property with deposited cash as soon as practicable and deliver those assets over the ten  calendar days following each deposit at termination of the trust olden lane reserves the right to sell trust property over a period of up to twenty  business days to lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the trust property the proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the trust will reflect the actual sales proceeds or termination payments as applicable received on such trust property which will likely differ from any applicable evaluation on the termination date � payment risk an issuer of certain trust property may be unable or unwilling to make distributions which may decrease the value of your investment in the trust � foreign securities risk the trust may invest in securities that are issued by foreign entities securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities the prices of foreign securities can be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as political social and economic developments abroad the differences between the regulations to which us and foreign issuers and markets are subject the seizure by the government of company assets excessive taxation withholding taxes on dividends and interest limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets and political or social instability other risks include the following � � � enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow in foreign countries and there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments � � b � � ��� foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us issuers and there may be less public information about their operations � ��� foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than us markets � ��� foreign securities often trade in currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect the trust�s value the value of dividends and interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to these other currencies may cause the value of the trust to decline certain foreign currencies may be particularly volatile and foreign governments may intervene in the currency markets causing a decline in value or liquidity in the trust�s foreign currency holdings � litigation and legislation risk�the trust is also subject to litigation and legislation risk from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the issuers of securities held by the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of securities held by the trust or of the sectors represented by these issuers may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively impact the prices of these securities olden lane cannot predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the prices of the securities � industry risks the trust may invest significantly in certain industries any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of these industries before you invest � consumer discretionary and consumer staples the trust may invest significantly in companies�that manufacture or sell various consumer products�general risks of these companies include the overall�state of the economy intense competition and�consumer spending trends a decline in the economy�which results in a reduction of consumers� disposable�income can negatively impact spending habits global�factors that may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services include political developments imposition of�import controls fluctuations in oil prices and changes in�exchange rates � competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and the success of consumer products and services in the marketplace consumer products and services companies may be subject to government regulation affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact performance tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws regulations and litigation � financial services the trust may invest significantly in banks and other financial services companies the trust may also enter into derivative transactions with banks or other financial services companies as counterparty��in general financial services companies are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions including but not limited to the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets interest rates as well as currency and commodities prices investor sentiment inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate competition from new entrants in their fields of business and the overall health of the us and international economies � the financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global developments over the last several years including recessionary conditions deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt a substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial institutions with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers into either liquidation or combination this has also drastically increased the credit risk and possibility of default of derivatives transactions and bonds issued by institutions faced with these problems many of the institutions may continue to experience difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital while the us and foreign governments and their respective government agencies have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps � � b � � such economic and political conditions and increased public scrutiny during the past several years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the us and abroad creating additional challenges for financial institutions regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services issuers are currently subject thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal costs as well as the potential for higher operational capital and liquidity costs these laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial institution does business and the products and services it may provide increased regulation may restrict a company�s ability to compete in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses new regulations may reduce or limit a company�s revenue or impose additional fees assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative consequences � among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the �doddfrank act� enacted into federal law on july   the doddfrank act includes reforms in order to address risks and issues in the nation�s evolving financial system it also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes including in areas such as systemic risk regulation overthecounter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection the doddfrank act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come including banks thrifts depository institution holding companies mortgage lenders insurance companies industrial loan companies broker dealers and other securities and investment advisory firms private equity and hedge funds consumers numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure these regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain trust property and could lead to decreases in the profits or revenues of certain issuers of trust property in many cases the full impact of the doddfrank act on a financial institution�s business remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed olden lane is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation on the trust property or on the financial services industry in general � healthcare investments in healthcare companies are subject to numerous risks including competition extensive government regulation and commercial difficulties these risks are particularly acute for healthcare companies in the pharmaceuticals devices life sciences and facilities subsectors of the healthcare industry the performance of healthcare companies is dependent upon successful and timely implementation of their business models which depends upon such companies ability to successfully introduce new products amidst changing technologies and competition the success of new product offerings generally depend on many factors including the ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner obtain or maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate products from those of competitors failure by a healthcare company to introduce successful products on schedule may have material adverse effects on its business financial condition and operational results there can be no assurance that any products now in development will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance in addition there has been an increased political and regulatory focus on healthcare laws in recent years and new legislation could have a material effect on the business and operations of healthcare companies by increasing their compliance and other costs of doing business requiring significant systems enhancements or rendering their products or services less profitable or obsolete � industrials the trust may invest significantly in industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition imposition of import controls volatility in commodity prices currency exchange rate fluctuation consolidation labor relations domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and leverage levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials depletion of resources government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives � industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel the number of housing starts levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and � � b � � retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment manufacturers stocks of transportation companies are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes fuel prices and insurance costs transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight which may negatively impact their businesses � information technology the trust may invest significantly in information technology companies these companies include companies that are involved in computer and business services enterprise softwaretechnical software internet and computer software internetrelated services networking and telecommunications equipment telecommunications services electronics products server hardware computer hardware and peripherals semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors these companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions an unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company the failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the company�s results information technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading announcements about new products technologies operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically at times however extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company this can impact your ability to redeem the units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid � utilities the trust may invest significantly in utilities companies��securities in the utilities industry can be very volatile and can be impacted significantly by supply and demand for services or fuel government regulation conservation programs commodity price fluctuations and other factors government regulation or oversight of utility companies may limit those companies� profits or the dividends they can pay to investors in addition utility companies may face regulatory restrictions with respect to expansion to new markets limiting their growth potential technological developments may lead to increased competition which could impact a company�s performance utility company equity securities to the extent they are purchased for their dividend yield historically have been sensitive to interest rate movements � inflation risk�inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money � investment strategy risk�although the trust�s investment strategy is designed to achieve the trust�s investment objective the strategy may not prove to be successful � �distribution of units � olden lane may at its own expense and out of its own profits pay for third party distribution assistance including but not limited to obtaining shelf space in clearing firms and similar activities designed to aid in the sale of olden lane�s products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units � olden lane may gain or lose money when it holds units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price olden lane pays for units and the price at which it sells or redeems them olden lane may also gain or lose money when it deposits securities to create units the amount of its profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities or other property into the trust is shown in the �notes to trust portfolio� for the trust � public distribution of units during the initial offering period units of the trust will be distributed to the

in any foreign country units will be sold through dealers who are members of finra and through others this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully � � b � � certain commercial banks may make units of the trust available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge discussed above is retained by the banks for these agency and brokerage transactions olden lane will retain the balance of any transactional sales fee � olden lane reserves the right to change the concessions or agency commissions set forth in part a of the prospectus from time to time in addition to such concessions or agency commissions olden lane may from time to time pay or allow additional concessions or agency commissions in the form of cash or other compensation to dealers employing registered representatives who sell during a specified time period a minimum dollar amount of olden lane products � also olden lane in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by olden lane pay fees to qualifying brokers or dealers for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trust such payments are made by olden lane out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trust these programs will not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that the trust will receive from the units sold � olden lane reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units � upon the completion of the initial offering units which remain unsold or which may be acquired in the secondary market may be offered at prices determined in the manner provided under �selling units�redemption�computation of

credited to the capital account of the trust income received by the trust will be distributed on or shortly after the distribution dates each year shown in part a of the prospectus on a pro rata basis to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date shown in part a of the prospectus however if set forth in part a of the prospectus that the trust will prorate distributions on an annual basis �income averaging� then income received by the trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of onetwelfth of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing  months all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all income received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of the trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the income of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following

us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are treated as a partnership or s corporation for us tax purposes you hold the units as other than a capital asset you are a brokerdealer or securities trader electing marktomarket treatment you are a bank thrift or other financial institution a former citizen or resident of the united states an investor whose functional currency is not the us dollar an investor subject to the alternative minimum tax a �controlled foreign corporation� or �passive foreign investment company� for us federal income tax purposes or are otherwise subject to special tax rules in addition this section other than the discussions under ��backup withholding� ��foreign unitholders� and ��fatca� does not describe your situation if you are not a �united states person� as defined in the code this section also does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences � this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to olden lane the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of the trust�s units as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state foreign country or other taxing jurisdiction � � b � � taxation of the trust��the trust has elected and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code a ric generally is not subject to federal income tax on income and gains distributed in a timely manner to its unitholders to qualify for treatment as a ric the trust generally must among other things � a������derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from i dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures or forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and ii net income derived from interests in �qualified publicly traded partnerships� as described below the income described in this subparagraph a �qualifying income� � b������diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the trust�s taxable year or by the end of the day period following the close of such quarter i at least  of the fair market value of the trust�s total assets is represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities the securities of other rics and other securities with such other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to a value not greater than  of the value of the trust�s total assets and to an amount not greater than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not greater than  of the value of its total assets is invested in x the securities other than us government securities and the securities of other rics of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the trust controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or y the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined below and � c������distribute with respect to each taxable year at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid�generally taxable ordinary income and the excess if any of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and net taxexempt interest income for such year � for purposes of the diversification test the identification of the issuer or in some cases issuers of a particular trust investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment in some cases identification of the issuer or issuers is uncertain under current law and an adverse determination or future guidance by the internal revenue service irs with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the trusts ability to meet the diversification test in b above � in general for purposes of the  gross income requirement described in subparagraph a above income derived from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized directly by the ric however  of the net income of a ric derived from an interest in a �qualified publicly traded partnership� a partnership x the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and y that derives less than  of its income from the qualifying income described in clause i of subparagraph a above will be treated as qualifying income in general such entities will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes because they meet the passive income requirement under code section c in addition although in general the passive loss rules of the code do not apply to rics such rules do apply to a ric with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership moreover the amounts derived from investments in foreign currency will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of subparagraph a above there is a possibility that the irs could issue guidance contrary to such treatment which could affect the trust�s ability to meet the  gross income test and adversely affect the manner in which the trust is managed � for purposes of the diversification test described in subparagraph b above the term �outstanding voting securities of such issuer� will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership also for purposes of the diversification test in b above the identification of the issuer or in some cases issuers of a particular trust investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment in some cases identification of the issuer or issuers is uncertain under current law and an adverse determination or future guidance by the irs with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the trust�s ability to meet the diversification test in b above � � b � � if in any taxable year the trust were to fail to meet the  gross income diversification or distribution test described above the trust could in some cases cure such failure including by paying a trustlevel tax paying interest making additional distributions or disposing of certain assets if the trust were ineligible to or did not cure such a failure for any taxable year or otherwise failed to qualify as a ric accorded special tax treatment under the code the trust would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gain if any would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income in such a case distributions from the trust would not be deductible by the trust in computing its taxable income in addition in order to requalify for taxation as a ric the trust may be required to recognize unrealized gains pay substantial taxes and interest and make certain distributions � as noted above if the trust qualifies as a ric that is accorded special tax treatment the trust will not be subject to federal income tax on income that is distributed in a timely manner to its unitholders in the form of dividends including capital gain dividends as defined below � the trust expects to distribute at least annually to its unitholders all or substantially all of its investment company taxable income computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and its net capital gain that is the excess of its net longterm capital gains over its net shortterm capital losses in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards investment company taxable income that is retained by the trust will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates if the trust retains any net capital gain it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained but it may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice mailed within  days of the close of the trust�s taxable year to its unitholders who in turn i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their shares of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the trust on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds on a properlyfiled us tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities if the trust makes this designation for federal income tax purposes the tax basis of units owned by a unitholder of the trust will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the unitholder�s gross income under clause i of the preceding sentence and the tax deemed paid by the unitholder under clause ii of the preceding sentence the trust is not required to and there can be no assurance that the trust will make this designation if it retains all or a portion of its net capital gain in a taxable year � in determining the amount available to support a capital gain dividend as defined below its taxable income and its earnings and profits a ric generally may elect to treat part or all of any postoctober capital loss defined as the greatest of net capital loss net longterm capital loss or net shortterm capital loss in each case attributable to the portion of the taxable year after october  or lateyear ordinary loss generally i net ordinary loss from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property attributable to the portion of the taxable year after october  plus ii other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion of the taxable year after december  as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year � amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a prescribed formula are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax at the trust level to avoid the tax the trust must distribute during each calendar year an amount generally equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for a oneyear period generally ending on october  of the calendar year and  all such ordinary income and capital gains that were not distributed in previous years for purposes of the required excise tax distribution ordinary gains and losses from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property that would be properly taken into account after october  are generally treated as arising on january  of the following calendar year also for these purposes the trust will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it is subject to corporate income tax for the taxable year ending within the calendar year the trust intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the excise tax although the trust reserves the right to pay an excise tax rather than make an additional distribution � a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of a calendar year if it is declared by the trust in october november or december of that year with a record date in such a month and is paid by the trust during january of the following year such distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received � � b � � capital losses in excess of capital gains �net capital losses� are not permitted to be deducted against the trust�s net investment income instead potentially subject to certain limitations the trust may carry net capital losses forward from any taxable year to subsequent taxable years to offset capital gains if any realized during such subsequent taxable years distributions from capital gains are generally made after applying any available capital loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset currentyear net realized capital gains whether the trust retains or distributes such gains if the trust incurs or has incurred net capital losses those losses will be carried forward to one or more subsequent taxable years without expiration any such carryforward losses will retain their character as shortterm or longterm � taxation of trust distributions distributions of investment income are generally taxable to unitholders as ordinary income taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the trust owned the investments that generated them rather than how long a unitholder has owned his or her units in general the trust will recognize longterm capital gain or loss on investments it has owned for more than one year and shortterm capital gain or loss on investments it has owned for one year or less tax rules can alter the trust�s holding period in investments and thereby affect the tax treatment of gain or loss on such investments distributions of net capital gain � the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital losses in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards � that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends �capital gain dividends� will be taxable to unitholders as longterm capital gains includible in net capital gain and may be taxable to individuals at reduced rates distributions of net shortterm capital gain as reduced by any net longterm capital loss for the taxable year will be taxable to unitholders as ordinary income � section  of the code generally imposes a  medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals whose income exceeds certain threshold amounts and of certain trusts and estates under similar rules the details of the implementation of this tax and of the calculation of net investment income among other issues are currently unclear and remain subject to future guidance for these purposes �net investment income� generally includes among other things i�distributions paid by the trust of net investment income and capital gains as described above and ii�any net gain from the sale redemption or exchange of trust units unitholders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment in the trust � distributions are taxable whether unitholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional units distributions are also taxable to unitholders even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the trust before a unitholder�s investment and thus were included in the price the unitholder paid for the trust units investors should be careful to consider the tax implications of buying units of the trust just prior to a distribution the price of units purchased at this time will include the amount of the forthcoming distribution but the distribution will generally be taxable � a dividend or capital gain dividend with respect to units of the trust held by a taxdeferred or qualified plan such as an ira retirement plan or corporate pension or profit sharing plan generally will not be taxable to the plan distributions from such plans will be taxable to individual participants under applicable tax rules without regard to the character of the income earned by the qualified plan unitholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the suitability of units of the trust as an investment through such plans and the precise effect of an investment on their particular situation � unitholders will be notified annually as to the us federal tax status of trust distributions and unitholders receiving distributions in the form of newly issued units will receive a report as to the value of the units received � qualified dividend income for trusts that hold equity securities �qualified dividend income� received by an individual is taxed at the rates applicable to net capital gain��in order for some portion of the dividends received by a unitholder to be qualified dividend income the trust must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividendpaying stocks in the portfolio and the unitholder must meet holding period or other requirements with respect to the trust�s units � dividendsreceived deduction for trusts that hold equity securities in general dividends of net investment income received by unitholders of the trust will qualify for the  dividendsreceived deduction generally � � b � � available to corporations to the extent of the amount of eligible dividends received by the trust from domestic corporations for the taxable year � disposition of units upon a sale exchange or other disposition of units of the trust a unitholder will generally realize a taxable gain or loss depending upon his or her basis in the units a gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the units are capital assets in the unitholder�s hands and generally will be longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss depending upon the unitholder�s holding period for the units any loss realized on a sale exchange or other disposition will be disallowed to the extent the units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the units are disposed of in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss any loss realized by a unitholder on the disposition of the trust�s units held by the unitholder for six months or less will be treated for tax purposes as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any distributions of capital gain dividends received or treated as having been received by the unitholder with respect to such units � market discount if the trust purchases in the secondary market a debt security that has a fixed maturity date of more than one year from its date of issuance at a price lower than the stated redemption price of such debt security or in the case of a debt security issued with �original issue discount� described below a price below the debt security�s �revised issue price� the excess of the stated redemption price over the purchase price is �market discount� if the amount of market discount is more than a de minimis amount a portion of such market discount must be included as ordinary income not capital gain by the trust in each taxable year in which the trust owns an interest in such debt security and receives a principal payment on it in particular the trust will be required to allocate that principal payment first to the portion of the market discount on the debt security that has accrued but has not previously been includable in income in general the amount of market discount that must be included for each period is equal to the lesser of i�the amount of market discount accruing during such period plus any accrued market discount for prior periods not previously taken into account or ii�the amount of the principal payment with respect to such period generally market discount accrues on a daily basis for each day the debt security is held by the trust at a constant rate over the time remaining to the debt security�s maturity or at the election of the trust at a constant yield to maturity which takes into account the semiannual compounding of interest gain realized on the disposition of a market discount obligation must be recognized as ordinary interest income not capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount � original issue discount certain debt securities may be treated as debt securities that were originally issued at a discount original issue discount can generally be defined as the difference between the price at which a security was issued and its stated redemption price at maturity original issue discount that accrues on a debt security in a given year generally is treated for federal income tax purposes as interest income that is included in the trust�s income and therefore subject to the distribution requirements applicable to rics even though the trust may not receive a corresponding amount of cash until a partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security � some debt securities may be purchased by the trust at a discount that exceeds the original issue discount on such debt securities if any this additional discount represents market discount for federal income tax purposes see above � if the trust holds the foregoing kinds of securities it may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount which is greater than the total amount of cash interest the trust actually received such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the trust or if necessary by disposition of trust property including at a time when it may not be advantageous to do so these dispositions may cause the trust to realize higher amounts of shortterm capital gains generally taxed to unitholders at ordinary income tax rates and in the event the trust realizes net capital gains from such transactions its unitholders may receive a larger capital gain dividend than if the trust had not held such securities � options futures forward contracts and swaps the tax treatment of certain contracts including regulated futures contracts and nonequity options entered into by the trust will be governed by section  of the code �section  contracts� gains or losses on these contracts generally are considered to be  longterm and  shortterm capital gains or losses �� although foreign currency gains or losses arising from certain section  contracts may be treated as ordinary in character see �foreign currency transactions� below also section  contracts held by the trust at the end of each taxable year and for purposes of the  excise tax on � � b � � certain other dates prescribed in the code are �markedtomarket� with the result that unrealized gains or losses are treated as though they were realized and the resulting gains or losses are treated as ordinary or  gains or losses as appropriate � the tax treatment of a payment made or received on a swap to which the trust is a party and in particular whether such payment is in whole or in part capital or ordinary in character will vary depending upon the terms of the particular swap contract � transactions in options futures forward contracts and swaps undertaken by the trust may result in �straddles� for federal income tax purposes the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses realized by the trust and losses realized by the trust on positions that are part of a straddle may be deferred under the straddle rules rather than being taken into account in calculating taxable income for the taxable year in which the losses are realized in addition certain carrying charges including interest expense associated with positions in a straddle may be required to be capitalized rather than deducted currently certain elections that the trust may make with respect to its straddle positions may also affect the amount character and timing of the recognition of gains or losses from the affected positions � because only a few regulations implementing the straddle rules have been promulgated the consequences of such transactions to the trust are not entirely clear the straddle rules may increase the amount of shortterm capital gain realized by a trust which is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to unitholders because application of the straddle rules may affect the character of gains or losses defer losses andor accelerate the recognition of gains or losses from the affected straddle positions the amount which must be distributed to unitholders as ordinary income or longterm capital gain may be increased or decreased substantially as compared to a trust that did not engage in such transactions � more generally investments by the trust in options futures forward contracts swaps and other derivative financial instruments are subject to numerous special and complex tax rules these rules could affect whether gains and losses recognized by the trust are treated as ordinary or capital accelerate the recognition of income or gains to the trust and defer or possibly prevent the recognition or use of certain losses by the trust the rules could in turn affect the amount timing or character of the income distributed to unitholders by the trust in addition because the tax rules applicable to such instruments may be uncertain under current law an adverse determination or future irs guidance with respect to these rules which determination or guidance could be retroactive may affect whether the trust has made sufficient distributions and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements including qualifying income and diversification requirements to maintain its qualification as a ric and avoid a trustlevel tax���accordingly while the trust intends to account for such transactions in a manner it deems to be appropriate the irs might not accept such treatment if it did not the status of the trust as a regulated investment company might be affected further requirements that must be met under the code in order for the trust to qualify as a regulated investment company including the qualifying income and diversification requirements applicable to a the trusts assets may limit the extent to which the trust will be able to engage in transactions in options futures contracts forward contracts swap and other derivative agreements � constructive sales under certain circumstances the trust may recognize gain from a constructive sale of an �appreciated financial position� it holds if it enters into a short sale forward contract or other transaction that substantially reduces the risk of loss with respect to the appreciated position in that event the trust would be treated as if it had sold and immediately repurchased the property and would be taxed on any gain but would not recognize any loss from the constructive sale the character of gain from a constructive sale would depend upon the trust�s holding period in the property appropriate adjustments would be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized on the position to reflect the gain recognized on the constructive sale loss from a constructive sale would be recognized when the property was subsequently disposed of and its character would depend on the trust�s holding period and the application of various loss deferral provisions of the code constructive sale treatment does not generally apply to a transaction if such transaction is closed on or before the end of the th day after the close of the trust�s taxable year and the trust holds the appreciated financial position throughout the day period beginning with the day such transaction closed the term �appreciated financial position� excludes any position that is �markedtomarket� � � b � � unrelated business taxable income under current law income of a ric that would be treated as ubti if earned directly by a taxexempt entity generally will not be attributed as ubti to a taxexempt entity that is a unitholder in the ric notwithstanding this �blocking� effect a taxexempt unitholder could realize ubti by virtue of its investment in the trust if units in the trust constitute debtfinanced property in the hands of the taxexempt unitholder within the meaning of code section b � a taxexempt unitholder may also recognize ubti if the trust recognizes �excess inclusion income� derived from direct or indirect investments in residual interests in remics or equity interests in tmps if the amount of such income recognized by the trust exceeds the trust�s investment company taxable income after taking into account deductions for dividends paid by the trust � in addition special tax consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts �crts� that invest in rics that invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in remics or equity interests in tmps under legislation enacted in december  a crt as defined in section  of the code that realizes any ubti for a taxable year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such ubti under irs guidance issued in october  a crt will not recognize ubti as a result of investing in a trust that recognizes �excess inclusion income� rather if at any time during any taxable year a crt or one of certain other taxexempt unitholders such as the united states a state or political subdivision or an agency or instrumentality thereof and certain energy cooperatives is a record holder of a unit in a trust that recognizes �excess inclusion income� then the trust will be subject to a tax on that portion of its �excess inclusion income� for the taxable year that is allocable to such unitholders at the highest federal corporate income tax rate the extent to which this irs guidance remains applicable in light of the december  legislation is unclear to the extent permitted under the investment company act of  the trust may elect to specially allocate any such tax to the applicable crt or other unitholder and thus reduce such unitholder�s distributions for the year by the amount of the tax that relates to such unitholder�s interest in the trust the trust has not yet determined whether such an election will be made � crts and other taxexempt investors are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences of investing in the trust � backup withholding the trust may be required to withhold federal income tax �backup withholding� from dividends and capital gains distributions paid to unitholders federal tax will be withheld if �the unitholder fails to furnish the trust with the unitholder�s correct taxpayer identification number or social security number �the irs notifies the unitholder or the trust that the unitholder has failed to report properly certain interest and dividend income to the irs and to respond to notices to that effect or �when required to do so the unitholder fails to certify to the trust that he or she is not subject to backup withholding the current backup withholding rate is  any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against the unitholder�s federal income tax liability � in order for a foreign investor to qualify for exemption from the backup withholding tax rates and for reduced withholding tax rates under income tax treaties the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing requirements foreign investors in the trust should consult their tax advisors in this regard � foreign unitholders distributions that are properly designated as capital gain dividends generally will not be subject to withholding of us federal income tax except as described below under ��fatca� in general dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the trust to a unitholder that is not a �united states person� within the meaning of the code such unitholder a �foreign unitholder� are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate even if they are funded by income or gains such as portfolio interest shortterm capital gains or foreignsource dividend and interest income that if paid to a foreign unitholder directly would not be subject to withholding � for distributions with respect to ric taxable years beginning before january   rics generally were not required to withhold any amounts i with respect to distributions��from ussource interest income of types similar to those not subject to us federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign investor��other than distributions w to an investor that did not provide a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner was not a united states person x that were attributable to certain interest on an obligation issued by the investor or by an obligor with respect to which the investor was a �percent shareholder� or a related �controlled foreign � � b � � corporation� or y to an investor that was within a foreign country that had an inadequate information exchange with the united states to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the ric in a written notice to its investors �interestrelated dividends� or ii with respect to distributions of net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses other than distributions to an individual foreign investor who was present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the distribution to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the ric in a written notice to its investors �shortterm capital gain dividends� it is currently unclear whether congress will extend these exemptions for distributions with respect to taxable years of a ric beginning on or after january   or what the terms of such an extension would be foreign unitholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts � if a beneficial owner of trust units who or which is a foreign unitholder has a trade or business in the united states and dividends from the trust are effectively connected with the conduct by the beneficial holder of that trade or business the dividends will in general be subject to us federal income taxation at regular income tax rates and in the case of a foreign corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax � in general except as described below under ��fatca� a beneficial holder of units that is a foreign unitholder is not subject to us federal income tax on gains and is not allowed a deduction for losses realized on the sale of units of the trust or on capital gain dividends unless i�such capital gain dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business carried on by such holder within the united states or ii�in the case of an individual holder the holder is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of the capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met � if a unitholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to us federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the unitholder in the united states � foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors and if holding units through intermediaries their intermediaries concerning the application of these rules to an investment in the trust � fatca sections  and  of the code commonly referred to as �fatca� generally require the trust to obtain certain information from each of its unitholders if a unitholder fails to provide this information or is a �nonparticipating foreign financial institution� the trust may be required to withhold at a rate of  with respect to that unitholder on dividends and other distributions including capital gain dividends and the proceeds of the sale redemption or exchange of trust units if a payment by the trust is subject to withholding under these rules the trust is required to withhold even if such payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to foreign unitholders described above eg capital gain dividends and shortterm capital gain and interestrelated dividends beginning as early as july   � each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of these rules and any other reporting requirements with respect to the prospective investor�s own situation including investments through an intermediary � foreign financial account reporting unitholders that are us persons and own directly or indirectly more than  of the trust could be required to report annually their �financial interest� in the trust�s �foreign financial accounts� if any on treasury department form td f  report of foreign bank and financial accounts fbar unitholders should consult a tax advisor and persons investing in the trust through an intermediary should contact their intermediary regarding the applicability to them of this reporting requirement � tax equalization the trust intends to distribute its net investment income and capital gains to unitholders at least annually to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code under current law provided the trust is not treated as a �personal holding company� for us federal income tax purposes the trust is permitted to treat on its tax return as dividends paid the portion of redemption proceeds paid to redeeming shareholders that represents the redeeming unitholders� portion of the trust�s undistributed investment company taxable income and net capital gain this practice which involves the use of tax �equalization� may have the effect of reducing the amount of income andor gains that the trust is required to distribute as dividends to nonredeeming unitholders the amount of any � � b � � undistributed income andor gains is reflected in the value of the trust�s units the total return on a unitholder�s investment will generally not be reduced as a result of the trust�s use of this practice � tax shelter disclosure under treasury regulations if a unitholder recognizes a loss on a disposition of the trust�s units of  million or more for an individual unitholder or  million or more for a corporate unitholder including for example an insurance company holding separate account the unitholder must file with the irs a disclosure statement on form  direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance unitholders of a ric are not excepted this filing requirement applies even though as a practical matter any such loss would not for example reduce the taxable income of an insurance company future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to unitholders of most or all rics the fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer�s treatment of the loss is proper unitholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances � other taxation the foregoing discussion is primarily a summary of certain us federal income tax consequences of investing in the trust based on the law in effect as of the date of this prospectus the discussion does not address in detail special tax rules
