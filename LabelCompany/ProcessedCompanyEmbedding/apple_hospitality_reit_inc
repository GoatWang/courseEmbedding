safety great pickmay  about apple hospitality aple michael boyd longshort equity contrarian mediumterm horizon midcapmarketplaceindustrial insightssummaryapple hospitality reit is a great way to play a beaten down sectormanagement has a unique and apparently quite viable strategy to navigating the hotel spacewhile the annual distribution has been stuck at share and likely will continue to be it is wellprotected and the monthly payment structure should tempt manyive spent a fair amount of time digging around in reits lately particularly within the hotel and lodging space i believe there is a lot of safe value there currently as most investors continue to move away based on slowing growth and industrywide fears that have a foundation but at the same time are likely overdone wellinformed investors have likely seen the same macroeconomic fears called out again and again room supply growth outstripping demand waning business travel the strong dollar impacting international leisure etc none of this is new but it has hamstrung total return within the asset class like ive spoken on before there are a couple of ways to play these companies when times are tough investors can go for deep value firms trading below net asset value nav invest with active management teams with a great history of timing cyclicality or just take the steady as she goes route and buy a company with quality assets and a clean balance sheet my preferred route has been through pebblebrook nysepeb which checks all of these boxes however the active style and smaller asset footprint bring with it substantially more risk and for a broader diversification play i would recommend apple hospitality nyseaple quite heavily apple hospitalitys approach if i had to describe apple hospitality with just one phrase i would say diversified with a focus on quality the company operates  hotels in  states primarily in highend suburban and urban markets serving patrons seeking longer stays extended stayselect service since these customers generally place an emphasis on room quality apple hospitality has an advantage over privatelyrun peers given its deep access to the capital markets the resulting capex spending particularly on room renovation has been a big hit with customers and the average age of properties either new construction or since an extensive renovation is just four years interestingly apple hospitality partners exclusively with hilton nysehlt and marriott nysemar hotels with the asset base split nearly  between the two chains as one of the larger independent property owners of these two brands this gives company management here a lot of influence in the hilton and marriott boardrooms and it also gives apple hospitality a great level of operating data to benchmark its own hotel operators against one another i like the themes behind the idea and it is definitely an interesting take compared to other reits in this space most of whom generally dont take much stock in the underlying brand and instead focusing entirely on cap rates and where they can wring out the most value while these brands are large and have wide footprints across the contiguous united states investors should keep in mind that this does limit the acquisition and expansion activity the company can undertake management noted as much on the q  conference call i think many of our peers have commented and wed concur that to date theres been a lack of product available and a significant bid spread moving away from the company diatribe here there are also downsides to the brand focus for one the value proposition for independent properties is higher for operators lower management fees more flexible contracts and quite a few of the better private operators have begun to shift to independent hotel management in order to get a bigger slice of the pie while branded properties do often have an edge when it comes to the consumer sales via loyalty programs as well as perceived product consistency and stronger marketing and advertising programs there are signs that consumers are shifting their consumption preferences increasingly differentiation and the experience are sought out which wellrun boutiqueindependent hotels honestly often put together better compounding the issue after waves of cuts to loyalty programs due to strong room demand postrecession there is less emphasis being placed on maintaining hotel loyalty by many in short the revpar premium long associated with branded hotels versus independents and what has been a justifying factor in the higher fees operators pay is eroding and in some markets may not even exist anymore personally i dont believe brand affiliation is as important as it was five to ten years ago dig into the financials apple hospitality got to its current size via several piecemeal mergers  merger with apple reit ten  merger with apple reit seven and apple reit eight which helped build the scale the company has today even on a gaap accounting basis ebitda margin has remained very steady throughout that time frame as the combined entity nearly tripled nominal underlying ebitda overall margin profile here has been very strong and is in most cases a couple hundred basis points ahead of what i would view as top tier managers in this industry pebblebrook lasalle nyselho boosting the allure apple hospitality accomplishes this on a substantially lower revenue per available room revpar and lower occupancy rates getting more granular there apple hospitality posted  in revpar in  compared to the aforementioned competitors that see revpar in the more than room range occupancy rates in the mids while above industry averages also pale versus peers that see rates in the  range some of this comes down to location apple hospitality has a much larger suburban presence whereas these focus on urban markets but a solid chunk comes down to the extended stay model where the tradeoff is lower rates for longer stays less room churn balance sheet health is quite strong as well leverage here is very light with net debtebitda sitting marginally below x well below industry averages apple hospitality will need to navigate debt maturities shortly the m on its revolver comes due in  m on the term loan in  on more than twothirds of its debt but given the current risk appetite in the market for quality corporate debt these refinancings should see rates very close to their existing terms given the higher remodel rates at apple hospitality capex needs are slightly more intensive than most of the industry which does reduce funds available for distribution capital spending was heavy in fiscal  and  which led net cash outflows debt raised to fund overall operations and the dividend the share distribution has not been raised since the  ipo and that likely is not going to change in the immediate future in my opinion with that said the  current yield is healthy and the monthly payment schedule is likely very alluring to income investors the opportunities to buy for cheaper than today have been fleeting october  reit selloff posttrump election january  market correction and pricing hasnt been that much better  cheaper for income investors now is as good a time as any in my opinion and it is worth a recommendation for investors seeking steady cash flow im in good company with this pick while brad thomas and i have had our disagreements on picks within the reit space this is one as well as pebblebrook where we are both big fans investors could do much worse than this one
