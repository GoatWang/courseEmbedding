training courses sierra monitor protect sentry it gas and fire detection solutions sentry it gas and fire detection solutions facilities ranging from small cng filling stations to fleet maintenance buildings wastewater lift stations to wastewater plants compressors pipelines refineries and even data rooms and cell tower huts present a common set of risks of hazard gas combustible gases such as natural gas methane or hydrogen represent a risk for facilities due to fire or explosion toxic gases including carbon monoxide hydrogen sulfide chlorine and many others represent a risk to personnel while inert gases such as nitrogen can cause oxygen displacement leading to asphyxiation facility managers must identify hazardous gas risks mitigate the possible causes and design continuous monitoring systems to warn of dangerous conditions many facilities also need to protect themselves from flame hazardsprotection from gas hazards is not a onesizefitsall proposition systems must be designed to provide the appropriate level of protection and response commensurate with the risk level and the resources available to install and manage the system sierra monitor’s sentry it fire and gas detection solution includes standalone sensor modules that can be integrated into the user’s safety and control system controller based systems with extremely flexible logic for customized response and enterprise wide systems that incorporate industrial internet of things iiot functions such as network connectivity webserver graphics capabilities and cloud data analytics selecting the right partner as a toptier supplier with  years of experience in a highly regulated industry sierra monitor’s products carry numerous third party approvals including underwriters labs factory mutual and safety integrity level ratings and comply with most relevant international standards sierra monitor has deep technical experience and the resources to advise develop and integrate the correct facility safety solution while selecting a fire and gas detection solution from a short list of toptier suppliers facilities safety managers should ask the following questions to compare the return on investment roi between the alternatives how long will it take to install the solution at my facility facilities are complex constructions and installing and wiring gas and flame sensor modules across the facility can be time consuming and therefore expensive sierra monitor offers a range of wiring connectivity options on each sensor module thereby simplifying and speeding up the installation process the installer can choose the option that is right for a particular construction type or zone the options include traditional analog  ma connectivity and various digital wiring options that can be configured in daisy chain hub or star topologies as required minimizing wiring complexity how long will it take to commission the entire system sierra monitor’s sentry it solution includes a unique autodiscovery capability that enables the controller to automatically discover all the sensor modules connected to the controller thereby saving time and preventing errors from manual commissioning a very simple programmable logic environment enables the facility manager to quickly implement closed loop detection and response workflow that is appropriate for their facility a “onebutton” test feature rapidly tests the logic and health of all the actuator devices like lights horns and strobes that participate in the response workflow a “onestep” upgrade capability allows the usb port to be used to rapidly update the operating system firmware application logic and user programs making it equally easy to recommission a system over the life of the solution how much time will be spent calibrating and recalibrating the sensor modules sensor modules are often located in hardtoreach places accessing and calibrating each sensor module individually is time consuming and requires multiple people sierra monitor’s unique globalcal™ technology enables a singleperson nonintrusive allatonce based approach to calibrating all sensor modules at one time from the controller there is no need for personnel to go the each sensor module to calibrate it another factor that adds to the cost associated with calibration is the frequency of recalibration many of sierra monitor’s modules are approved by the various agencies for recalibration every six months versus the more standard three month recalibration cycle required by most other vendors the longer recalibration cycles are enabled by sierra monitor’s use of advanced digital signal processing dsp based filtering algorithms the combination of globalcal and less frequent recalibration results in labor cost savings of up to  for sierra monitor’s customers how can ongoing maintenance and replacement costs be lowered predictive maintenance and replacement or recalibration of sensor modules is superior compared to reactive maintenance or schedulebased maintenance with sierra monitor’s sensesafe™ technology the controllers use raw voltage information from the sensor modules to assess drift along with statistical process control algorithms to determine when recalibration would be required for a particular sensor or when a module might require replacement the facilities safety manager can use this information to potentially further extend the recalibration interval or use this information to make a more informed decision on when to replace individual sensor modules does the solution support advanced analytics that could proactively highlight a safety issue well before it becomes critical the sentry it controllers have a very large amount of memory to log alarm and events by defining different alarm levels large amounts of time series data can be collected at the individual sensor module or zone level and that data can be analyzed to identify lowlevel safety anomalies that can be addressed proactively how long will it take to integrate the system with an existing building management system or programmable logic controller plc or to the cloud for remote monitoring and analytics the sentry it solution from sierra monitor incorporates a fieldserver gateway the industry’s leading multiprotocol gateway product the fieldserver gateway makes it very easy for the installer or integrator to complete the integration step in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks from navy ships to data centers and from pipelines to cng facilities sierra monitor’s gas and fire detection solutions are

resources landfill methane mitigation a landfill site also known as a rubbish dump is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial and is the oldest form of waste treatment historically landfills have been the most common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world decomposition of waste produces combustible and toxic gases that move from higher pressure areas areas deep within the landfill to lower pressure areas areas such as ground surface and offsite areas these gases easily move through loose sand or gravel soils and are released into the air through any available crack or opening while wind dilutes the gas with fresh air it can also move hazardous gas into neighboring communities many people find the odors emitted from a landfill to be unpleasant and may suffer temporary symptoms such as nausea and headache many landfill sites are also subsequently repurposed and used as sites to construct large residential commercial or industrial facilities when buildings are constructed on top of a closed landfill or situated next to a closed or open landfill a buildup of toxic and combustible gases is possible it is therefore essential that all buildings in the vicinity of an active or repurposed landfill implement continuous and accurate gas monitoring to ensure the health and safety of the occupants gas and fire detection hazardous gases that emit from landfill sites include combustible gases such as methane hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide gas must be monitored in the subsurface near the surface and above the surface in the air of a landfill gas detection may take place in monitoring wells ventilation systems andor buildings on or offsite gas sample locations and sampling methods vary from landfill to landfill depending on monitoring concerns or regulatory requirements in extreme circumstances a landfill fire can occur if methane was not properly detected therefore fire detectors must be placed near sources of ignition placing industrialgrade gas detectors within the buildings that are proximal to the landfills is also common the gas and flame detectors provide their measurements to a controller that can trigger the appropriate alarming or mitigation response the controller also stores the data for subsequent diligence analysis  automation and integration strategies buildup of combustible gases can cause a hazard to a building built on a landfill site particularly in enclosed areas such as basements and crawlspaces that might contain heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac or electrical equipment smaller buildings without a centralized building automation system bas should program the controller in the gas detection system to trigger a series of visual or audio alarms to turn off any ignition source near the location of the discharge of gas and to remotely notify a central monitoring center the controller could also implement strategies such as texting or emailing notifications to appropriate health and safety responders in the case of a large facility with a centralized bas the gas detection system should integrate with the bas and fit within its management and workflow framework  automated safety systems such as those described in this section should be “performance approved” and checked on a periodic basis products for landfill methane

adversely affected in quality by substances like human waste food scraps oils and chemicals wastewater treatment also known as sewage treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater through physical chemical and biological procedures wastewater treatment facilities clean used water for the benefit of our environment and personal health however the treatment process is chemically intensive and can pose a threat to the safety of personnel working at the facility consequently the wastewater treatment facility manager must ensure that the facilitys safety is not compromised by instrumenting the plant with a comprehensive gas detection alarming and mitigation system gas detection and alarming the process of treating wastewater creates many toxic and combustible gases moreover there are many enclosed spaces in a wastewater treatment plant where toxic gases can build up or inert gases can deplete oxygen to endanger plant personnel to ensure maximum wastewater treatment safety these hazardous gases may be encountered combustible gases methane pentane hydrogen hydrogen sulfide oxygen deficiency carbon monoxide chlorine sulfur dioxide processes within a

equally important to take remediation actions this can be done through integrating the gas detection and alarm system with the supervisory control and data acquisition scada the programmable logic controller plc or the building management system bms responsible for automating the larger facility for example a common integration would be a modbus rtu gas sensor with a bacnetip bms other automation processes may include providing notifications as a local alarm to an employees phone tablet andor pc as these systems are automated the regulatory agencies require that the systems be “performance approved and checked on a periodic basis products for wastewater treatment wastewater treatment facilities require a gas detection system that includes gas detection modules a method to communicate to a controller flexible alarm handling and a method for communicating data to higherlevel systems to take facilitywide remediation actions the ability to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis is also key  sierra monitors nationally recognized testing lab nrtl approved sentry it fire and gas solutions can ensure the safety and protection of assets and personnel in
