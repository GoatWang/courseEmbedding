company in lowell mill workeredit lowell massachusetts in the early s at the age of ten harriet started to work in the lowell mills by her own account she wanted to work so she could earn money for herself and the experience was good for her however there may have been an element of necessity since her mother earned little money from running the boarding house her job which paid  per week was as a doffer replacing full bobbins with empty ones the job took only a quarter of each hour and during the free periods the children could play or read or even go home for a while in  the lowell mill girls organized their second strike or turn out as they called them the first strike had been in  over a  cut in wages this second strike was over an increase in board charges that was equivalent to a  cut in wages to harriet aged eleven it was her first strike in her autobiography she recounted it with pride when the day came on which the girls were to turn out those in the upper rooms started first and so many of them left that our mill was at once shut down then when the girls in my room stood irresolute uncertain what to do asking each other would you or shall we turn out and not one of them having the courage to lead off i who began to think they would not go out after all their talk became impatient and started on ahead saying with childish bravado i don’t care what you do i am going to turn out whether any one else does or not and i marched out and was followed by the others — hanson robinson  pp –b boott mills boardinghouse and storehouse lowell harriet was harming her own mother by striking since her mother would have benefited from the increase in boarding charges harriet was not to realize this until she was older as a consequence of the strike several of the mills reversed the increase in charges and the boarding system was reviewed on the grounds that — it being the principal inducement for young women and girls to come and work at the mills in the first place — if they were so dissatisfied with it as to strike then it was not having its desired effect but the strike leaders were fired from their jobs as was harriets mother which harriet depicted in her autobiography as an act of petty revenge for harriets own actions harriet continued to work in the mills after the strike was over graduating to tending a spinning frame and then becoming a drawingin girl one of the better jobs in the mill the drawing room was relatively quiet away from the spinning and weaving machinery the drawingin girl took over after the warp threads had been wound onto the takeup beam and drew each thread through the harness and reeds using a long metal hook she could sit on a stool or a chair as she worked once this was complete the beam would be delivered to the weaving room the pay was on a piecework basis so harriet could work at her own pace and during periods when the looms were operating could find a quiet room away from the machinery where she could read educationedit lowell offering number   wholly written by females employed in the mills harriet obtained an elementary education before starting work in the mill while working as a doffer she also attended evening classes at the age of fifteen she left the mills for two years to study french latin and english grammar and composition at lowell high school studying in a wooden school room in a building that had a butchers shop on the ground floor the titles of two of her compositions have survived poverty not disgraceful and indolence and industry reflecting her opinion that there was nothing wrong with the honest labor of poor people harriet returned to the mills working there until  but in her spare time participated in literary groups in lowell lowell was rich in educational and cultural opportunities for women at that time there were libraries and bookstores evening schools and lectures concerts and balls two of the first magazines written by women were published in the town the lowell offering and the new england offering betsey guppy chamberlain – one of harriets companions in the mills became a noted contributor of sketches and stories to the lowell offering harriet said that the fame of the lowell offering caused the mill girls to be considered very desirable for wives and that young men came from near and far to pick and choose for themselves and generally with good success harriet also wrote and published poetry and it was through this that she met her future husband william robinson who was working as an editor at the lowell journal which published some of her work marriageedit harriet married william stevens robinson – on thanksgiving day of  when she was twentythree also from a poor background robinson was a writer for a newspaper and a supporter of the free soil party which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories this made it hard for him to keep a job during the early years of her marriage harriet was not interested in womens rights in her early writings she described the pleasure of having a husband to handle worldly problems while her job was to take care of him and said that for this reason she did not want to vote harriet later adopted the womens rights cause after her husband had taken it up the couple were to have four children one of whom died young and also looked after harriets mother often they struggled to make ends meet in  the couple moved to malden a new residential suburb five miles from boston buying a house two blocks from the railway station this was to be harriets home for the rest of her life at first robinson struggled to earn a living as a journalist they had a large garden where they grew fruit and vegetables and made some money by raising chickens and selling the eggs after the civil war for eleven years from  robinson held a wellpaying job as clerk of the massachusetts house of representatives in  harriet joined the american womans suffrage organization led by lucy stone and founded the malden womens club robinson was forced out of his job by the politician benjamin butler and in  died after a long illness her daughter elizabeth was considered to be a pioneer in introducing kindergarten to connecticut contributions in later yearsedit as a widow harriet robinson rented out rooms to support herself her three daughters and her aged mother she wrote several books including a biography of her husband and became increasingly active in the womens suffrage movement harriets book loom and spindle  portrayed the industrial town of lowell in her childhood and youth as a time of great opportunity for mill girls who learned the discipline of labor and gained broader ideas about the world from their experiences the book continues to be read more than one hundred years after it was published susan b anthony harriet and her daughter harriet lucy robinson shattuck organized the national woman suffrage association of massachusetts associated with susan b anthonys organization and harriet robinson made the opening address at the  boston convention of the organization they also helped julia ward howe to organize the new england womens club harriet robinson corresponded extensively with the suffrage movement leaders elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony when the national woman suffrage association opened on  may  at the tremont temple in boston harriet robinson welcomed the delegates and guests at this session she offered the following resolution whereas we believe that it is not safe to trust the great question of womans political rights solely to the legislature or to the voters of the state therefore resolved that it is the duty of the women of massachusetts to organize an active work to secure a sixteenth amendment to the united states constitution harriet robinson wrote enthusiastically in  never in the history of civilization has woman held the political legal or social position that she does in massachusetts today new avenues of employment for her capacity are constantly being opened and in every department of public trust to which she has been promoted she has shown her ability in this first hour of womans triumph it only remains for her to keep what she has gained and use faithfully the new privileges which have come into her life trained leaders are needed—women strong of purpose who are willing to confront the public as presiding officers or as public speakers and to guide wisely the large masses of their sex who have not yet learned to think for themselves harriet never took a theoretical position on womens rights and may have been largely motivated by an ambition to advance in society which the movement offered however she became a formidable advocate of suffrage in her writings and as a public speaker the poet lucy larcom a friend of harriet who had also worked in the mills as a child wrote of her mrs robinson is deeply interested in all the movements which tend to the advancement of women and uses her pen and her voice freely in their behalf she was the first woman to speak before the select committee on woman suffrage in congress and has spoken for the cause before the legislature of her own state where she is not only a citizen but a vote as far as the law allows additionally harriet contributed to the fourteenth annual report of the massachusetts bureau of statistics of labor published in the following is an excerpt from this annual report written by harriet robinson they the mill girls went forth from their alma mater the lowell factory carrying with them the independence the selfreliance taught in that hard school and they have done their little part towards performing the useful labor of life into whatever vocation they entered they have made practical use of the habits of industry and perseverance learned during those early years skilled labor teaches something not to be found in books or in colleges their early experience developed their charactersand helped them to fight well the battle of life harriet lived to the age of eightysix dying at home in malden on  december  bibliographyedit although she published several books harriet robinson did not make

wesley hanson was to become prominent in the universalism movement and author of several books on the subject  claudia lauper bushman observes that harriets account of the strike she experienced when she was a child grew in the telling over the years although it didnt differ in the facts the story that harriet told in her fifties of the same incident was less embellished than the account given in her later autobiography and also less embellished than when she related it at the international council of women in washington dc in  impressing at least one newspaper reporter who interviewed her at the time bushman comments that through her linking the incident in her autobiography to the cause of womens suffrage that she didnt actually take up until much older harriet effectively wrote herself a place in history where she has become credited as a pioneer and leader at an early age in the womens suffage movement however harriets room was just one of over  such mill rooms — there being nearly two thousand strikers in all — in many of which girls and women who would have taken similar action in the face of indecisiveness and even by harriets own account this act of childish bravado was all that she did of note in a monthlong strike citations  whos who in america  google books booksgoogleca retrieved    whos who in america with world notables   google books booksgoogleca retrieved

solely to the legislature or to the voters of the state therefore resolved that it is the duty of the women of massachusetts to organize an active work to secure a sixteenth amendment to the united states constitution harriet robinson wrote enthusiastically in  never in the history of civilization has woman held the political legal or social position that she does in massachusetts today new avenues of employment for her capacity are constantly being opened and in every department of public trust to which she has been promoted she has shown her ability in this first hour of womans triumph it only remains for her to keep what she has gained and use faithfully the new privileges which have come into her life trained leaders are needed—women strong of purpose who are willing to confront the public as presiding officers or as public speakers and to guide wisely the large masses of their sex who have not yet learned to think for themselves harriet never took a theoretical position on womens rights and may have been largely motivated by an ambition to advance in society which the movement offered however she became a formidable advocate of suffrage in her writings and as a public speaker the poet lucy larcom a friend of harriet who had also worked in the mills as a child wrote of her mrs robinson is deeply interested in all the movements which tend to the advancement of women and uses her pen and her voice freely in their behalf she was the first woman to speak before the select committee on woman suffrage in congress and has spoken for the cause before the legislature of her own state where she is not only a citizen but a vote as far as the law allows additionally harriet contributed to the fourteenth annual report of the massachusetts bureau of statistics of labor published in the following is an excerpt from this annual report written by harriet robinson they the mill girls went forth from their alma mater the lowell factory carrying with them the independence the selfreliance taught in that hard school and they have done their little part towards performing the useful labor of life into whatever vocation they entered they have made practical use of the habits of industry and perseverance learned during those early years skilled labor teaches something not to be found in books or in colleges their early experience developed their charactersand helped them to fight well the battle of life harriet lived to the age of eightysix dying at home in malden on  december  bibliographyedit although she published several books harriet robinson did not make

wesley hanson was to become prominent in the universalism movement and author of several books on the subject  claudia lauper bushman observes that harriets account of the strike she experienced when she was a child grew in the telling over the years although it didnt differ in the facts the story that harriet told in her fifties of the same incident was less embellished than the account given in her later autobiography and also less embellished than when she related it at the international council of women in washington dc in  impressing at least one newspaper reporter who interviewed her at the time bushman comments that through her linking the incident in her autobiography to the cause of womens suffrage that she didnt actually take up until much older harriet effectively wrote herself a place in history where she has become credited as a pioneer and leader at an early age in the womens suffage movement however harriets room was just one of over  such mill rooms — there being nearly two thousand strikers in all — in many of which girls and women who would have taken similar action in the face of indecisiveness and even by harriets own account this act of childish bravado was all that she did of note in a monthlong strike citations  whos who in america  google books booksgoogleca retrieved    whos who in america with world notables   google books booksgoogleca retrieved
