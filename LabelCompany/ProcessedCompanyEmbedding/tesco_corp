first the purpose of every cds model is to provide a mechanized way of running casing and ensuring that casing reaches bottom without fail it has been proven that pipe rotation and reciprocation while cementing helps to achieve a more reliable and secure cement job tesco’s casing running tools provide the ability to rotate circulate and reciprocate pipe simultaneously during cementing operations oftentimes casing running tools are only utilized in cases when pipe is stuck downhole tesco’s cds tools can certainly handle challenging situations such as stuck pipe however the cds is built for more tesco’s cds works with the top drive to easily attain smooth make up with no bending load and with precise control on final torque rig up your cds from the beginning of the job and collect the costsaving and productivity benefits throughout the casing or cementing processes tesco’s cds also decreases the amount of equipment required onsite and provides safety benefits in several ways a mechanized casing running tool replaces typical conventional equipment such as the power casing tong casing elevators and spiders and a dedicated hydraulic power unit this decreases manpower required saves on equipment costs and provides a less cluttered and thereby a safer working environment the cds also eliminates the need to have a stabbing board operator working which has been identified as a top factor that can cause losttime incidents during operations explore the range of casing running tools tesco has to offer and find the cds model that best fits your needs contacts tesco

environment and reducing costs the latest generation of catwalks on the market the tesco automated catwalk tac system transfer tubulars between the pipe rack and the rig floor in an efficient controlled manner the tac has an extendable trough which gives operators the ability to customize its position to the approximate inch required at well center this drastically reduces the swing weight of the tubular being picked up from the trough and it reduces the amount of space necessary for the rig crew to push back from the tubular when laying down an onboard programmable logic controller plc allows the operator to move critical functions of the catwalk simultaneously positioning it precisely where the trough needs to be on the rig floor tacs can be operated wirelessly with an explosionproof remote from the rig floor or manually from the valve back on the tac tacs are designed to achieve zero contact with personnel when picking up a casing string the tac is equipped with casing runs that are pinned onto its side this creates a bridge between the pipe racks and the catwalk and keeps workers at safe distance additionally the tac system’s open belly design and its ability to manipulate the arms horizontally provide for ease of maintenance and allows the operator or technician to troubleshoot in a more open and thereby safer working environment in fact most troubleshooting can be diagnosed by standing on the outside of the catwalk’s frame looking in each tac is equipped with gull wings that swing outward and can be hydraulically lowered to create a ramp so that drill pipe can roll off into pipe tubs or a waiting loader after the initial set up the rig crew has no need to come in contact with the tac again except to perform maintenance or move to a new location please note that certain models may require longer lead times for particular locations explore the current tac systems to discover which model is right for your rig contacts tesco
