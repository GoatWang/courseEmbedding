ellis international while numerous macroeconomic issues are affecting the apparel industry in the united states and worldwide we are pleased to report that this was a quarter where we were able to improve analyst estimates and build the guidance for perry we are fully focused on growing our core global brands through our excellent inventory management coupled with our strong product performance we delivered an adjusted gross margin of  a full  basis point ahead of last year we will continue focusing on our growth to drive our gross margin to  over the next few years we managed sga very well despite of rising cost and overhead and trends allowing us to report an adjusted ebitda margin of  for the quarter compared to  at the end of fiscal year with this backdrop were confident to project an increase in revenues for this year to a range of  million to  million in revenue we are confirming our earning guidance for the year in the range of adjusted earnings per share of  to  this represents an increase over adjusted eps last year despite that consumer behavior is changing so much so rapidly which approached great question as to the future of the apparel business we feel that we have been building the right infrastructure to be successful in this new environment were concentrated with a focus approach to various growth global core brand and businesses which are perry ellis original penguin golf lifestyle savane cubavera on the women brands as well as farah in europe oscar will inform you about the performance of each of those brands were very proud that through the years we have developed a veryvery diversified and balanced customer base that can achieve solid results despite the fact that some of our business partners are experiencing sales decline we all know that the department store brickandmortar business has been heavily impacted by the growth of ecommerce especially on the womens side by the advent of the vertical european retailers like zara hm primark and japanese uniqlo the department store business represents approximately  of our business we think that retailers have taken the right step to reduce their store base and close underperforming store as they diminish in size the lower inventory niche will allow them to increase their cash flow and increase the cash availability which will help them improve the performance in the years ahead were also applauding the changes that retailers are making to receive flows ensuring that goods are hitting selling floor and customers are shopping thereby driving faster turns or reduced markdowns for them and for us this will provide a more level flow for our quarterly reporting as well as on our quarter by quarter basis generally speaking we believe that the new reduce retail space in america is a very positive development in the long run it provides retailer with more flexibility to maneuver the tremendous demographic implication of generation d and y versus generation x and baby boomers the generational moves are creating a new paradigm which brands and retailers better learn to navigate if they want to succeed from a working capital perspective were able to reduce our inventory to  million compared to  million at the end of last quarter this is our lowest inventory in many years the strategic reduction in inventory allows to drive more profitable top line and allows your company to enter the new fiscal year in a very healthy condition needless to say were extremely proud of the progress we continue to make towards our near and longterm objectives on the international side we continue to be very bullish in the united kingdom and europe as well as mexico and canada business in the uk is already improving considerably while at the same time we continue to increase our business in the continent the first quarter was a good indication that our business is strengthening in the continent and the uk the consumer will always expect in the higher prices consequence of the evaluation of the costs weve seen that by the second half of the year our foreign exchange losses which have reduced our earnings for the last eight quarters will improve considerably as a matter fact were reviewing the possibilities of establishing on operation in the netherland to be able to better serve the continental cost we continue to execute against our strategic initiative to grow our international business in the first quarter international revenues grew  and accounted for  of total revenue up from last year  for the fullyear we expect international growth would to grow nearly to  million  of our yearoveryear to generate  of our revenue up from last year  we remain quite bullish about our business in europe our launch of nike swim across europe is exceeding expectations our latest farah brand continues its strong growth  yearoveryear and is expanding to nonuk business into european market behind urban outfitter asos zalando and specialty accounts are opted due to business in the continent grew over  this year as we expand this reduction in germany and open new markets such as greece israel and soon south africa and callaway which is today the best and most popular golf line in the world is increasing its footprint and penetration in profitable big box or in goods and golf specialty retailer to compliment our core green grass and independent accounts we are managing now six brands in europe original penguin farah vintage farah classic callaway ben hogan and most recently nike swim this gives us a lot of leverage to open totally different channel of this reduction which are critical for the future of our growth ideas and projections for europe we expect that our business in canada will grow over  yearoveryear led by strong perry ellis performance indiscernible accounts in canada then europe and mexico we benefit from our diverse portfolio brands excluding nike and other fashion in swim brand and golf led by callaway and pga tour finally mexico despite currently another challenge we continue to record double digit growth as we optimize our direct nike swim and others swim business with marty liverpool and other important accounts for the quarter international grew by  versus last year on the retail and directtoconsumer front we experienced sales decline more notably in our full price stores and shoe outlets launching  stores for last year cost us  million in revenues and this quarter costs us above another  million however our retail sales were much more profitable this quarter than we have had in the number of years the store that we were depriving this year will reduce sales by about  million but again we will have improved our revenues per share by the end of the year we project to have  stores in the united states we will continue opening store book with a more selective approach and in areas where rental in line with the potential revenue that these stores could generate in such sense on the licensing front during this quarter we terminated the relationship with the major licensee and gave that product license to our current licensee that will now have better opportunities to self product that relate with other was a onetime hit as we called out in november quarteroverquarter comparisons are distorted by some extraordinary transition in any one year and while our licensing partners are not immune from retail another challenge we continue to see organic growth which complements our expansion in new categories and market we have been especially encouraged by growth in perry ellis luggage and footwear with revenue increasing  over prior year our successful launch of our original penguin home fashion with few partners such as deluxe and bed bath and beyond by our triple digit success and leverage in the brand equity and momentum of farah in europe as well as our traction we got another brands in your portfolio to ultimately generate meaningful licensee income we expect four no agreements in this quarter three of which are in international market and we have a robust pipeline of new licensees we expect to conclude over the next several quarter we remain on track to achieve our targets of  to  no agreement to  to  no agreement across our portfolio brands were projecting approximately  licenses by year end we continue to focus shopper in the digital world we have always been forward thinking on technology and weve seen throughout the years how different disruptions have influenced to date market in the united state the original disruptors were really the offprice challenge plus and lower price share this brought commoditization of product that helps their growth as prices kept declining our department stores unfortunately did not see that coming furthermore vertical foreign companies with superior speed to market innovation and fast delivery like zara hm primark and uniqlo strong affected the womens side of the business again striking many brickandmortar retails very hard ecommerce was a major disruptor everybody knew that ecommerce was going to grow but some retailers did not see that way and came in with very late amazon successfully operated a nonprofitable organization which allowed to build an amazing tech company and now it controlled  of searches and keep growing worldwide the next disruptor in the years ahead and a very well be artificial intelligence ai which will continue to disrupt the all retail models and on top of all that the increase in real estate values brought super high rents which many retailers could not effort to pay all of the above five have contributed to the presence state of the first in the retail business so the question is what are we going to do at perry ellis we indentified many of these trends early and because of this we have been able to transition our company to our successful model for the present and for the future were always concerned of our longterm profitability even if it has shortened profit we see the changes in demographic increase in sales via smartphone apps making it easier and easier to shop on your phone this will continue to have a big influence in sales and apparel and almost every other category we have adopted and implemented several digital initiatives using new stateoftheart software in order to lower our cost of design and production were working to reduce our distribution cost by the end of the year we have also acquired data mining software and joined our software partners to help us grow substantially our onsite sales as well as our retail customer digital sales fit to market is an extremely important initiative its obvious in the fact that adidas has through their ability to replenish sold their products in just  days nike has also announced that they plan to double their supply and change speed the investment in the last two years in new plants and equipment in asia to be able to make apparel better faster and cheaper are really mindboggling you have to go to asia and visit some of these super modern factories to realize how much money has been invested in the future our strategy has worked very well and it has allowed us to establish a strong foothold in different channels in different geographies and in different areas perry ellis and product lines were very proud that our financial condition is the strongest in  years for this quarter the company performance and working capital discipline has resulted in a lower net debt to capitalization of  we have a very strong balance sheet ready for growth in both the united states as well as international your company is in great shape thank you i will now turn over the call to oscar oscar feldenkreis thank you george and good morning everyone im pleased to be speaking to you today on our first quarter call the quarter marked a solid start to the year as we delivered sales and earnings above our guidance as expected sales rose in our core global brand with earlier shipments of spring merchandize driving the outperformance versus guidance in total revenues declined as a planned versus the prior year as we remain laser focused on positioning our brands and the higher productive doors while reducing inventory to improve churns and margins importantly the execution of this strategy is elevating our powerful core brand with consumers through the continuous introduction of innovative fabrics and our trend apparel and accessories through the expansions of our marketing to intensify our digital reach and through our actions to make it even easier to shop our brands whenever and wherever consumers choose shop on mobile online and in store during the quarter we also continued to make progress on our speed to market initiative which are expected to reduce lead times so that we bring product to stores faster and meet the demands of the retailers today which are as you know are looking for product closer to the needs of selling and we maintained our relentless discipline on expenses and inventory management all of this served us well and positions our company to achieve our core sales and growth for the year across our divisions golf nike rafealla contributed to our better than expected sales and earnings performance as expected laundry sales declined as we work on the relaunch of the brand as we mentioned during our third quarter call last year we welcome back veronica davis to laundry veronica led the laundry teams since we acquired it in  and was instrumental in driving the brands growth which more than doubled under our leadership we have no doubt that she will be equally successful and will ensure that the da of the brand matches its customers profile with product execution and marketing turning to reviewing our business beginning with golf we are very pleased about our positive performance in golf which demonstrated our continuous dominance in the golf apparel business during the quarter we saw strength in bottoms as we introduce new pants and shorts with a comfort waistband which have exceeded sales expectations we also add new fabrics with new motion technology in the manufacturing of the garments this has lead to a fantastic beginning of the golf seasons for us across all distribution channel and brands in the united states canada and europe as we move into the most important quarters for golf we are very optimistic that these new products will continue to outperform the importance of stretch is gaining momentum across retailers we are pleased to be one of the early movers in offering stretch product and expect to capitalize on our proven expertise in this area the retailers seek us out for with all these new products in our golf brands which incorporated performance fabrics and stretch offerings we are ahead of the competition looking ahead we are very excited about our new fabrics that we will be introducing as well as our pipeline of new initiatives in golf that will continue to drive our performance we are also very excited about the jack nicklaus launch into a large mass retailer with an introduction to  doors we are very excited about the new opportunities with this relationship as it sets the stage for a multitier brand approach our golf callaway golf business also had a strong quarter with a notable strength in the uk which i saw as  increase in sales were looking to capitalize on the continued success of callaways brand performance as recently announced on the earnings call we renewed our callaway license agreement through  which has opened the doors for us to pursue new opportunities for growth across the authentic green grass channel our offcourse specialty and better department store channels we introduced map pricing in callaway which has resulted in a positive response from the authentic channel during the quarter we expand the callaway into golf galaxy pga tour superstore academy and golfhound in canada just to name a few we continue to expect golf to continue to grow in high singledigits this year the first quarter is a largest shipping quarter for the year for nike swim and we are pleased with its performance of retail across mens and womens and young athletes and swim gear our nike business continues to perform extremely well in the us and weve seen significant opportunities ahead to expand international in fact we expect to be shipping product into about  countries by year end giving our expanded relationships as it relates to the product the expansion of hydroguard uv protection swim tops continues to perform well and we expect to build upon the positive momentum with the upcoming deliveries the introduction of extended sizes in men and womens also has been a success across retail which is leading to additional growth as additional retailers add this category going forward entering to q we believe that we are well prepared to meet the needs of our customers as well as our ecommerce accounts which are benefitting from a year around demand online receptive to the new  nike spring season product the preview has been very strong and were very excited about the introduction into new geography overall we expect to maintain our dominance in the swim market where were taking share domestically with the expectations of transferring this success on a global scale perry ellis continues to perform well while the quarter started slow as noted across retail generally early spring product sold well with particularly strength in linen sportswear were very excited about the continuing expansions of perry ellis  at leisure functional sportswear product we plan to expand the  collection further within the specialty accounts in the second half of the year pants under perry ellis portfolio performed extremely strong with positive sell through rates across all customers driven by the introduction of the performance fabrics and new models on the ecom side ecommerce continues to do well both internally and thirdparty were focused on ensuring the experience with the consumer with product in store to online as the same and we will continue investing on ensuring that we‚Äôre positioned for strong growth in ecommerce digital going forward we will continue to manage inventories very tightly to maintain a strong sellthrough and fast return we feel good about the perry ellis prospects q given strong early reads on the newness we delivered ahead of fathers day were also excited to announce that we have retained a new pr an ad agency that will help us get our messaging across to the end consumer with an increased emphasis on digital and were also looking forward to the august launch of our new perry ellis fragrance as we mentioned in our q call we named the new president for the original penguin brands and are pleased with the early results while we saw a fine revenue reduction in original penguin as we took a concentrated effort to reduce unproductive retail stores and channels and reduce use this effort enable us to drive quality sales of full price selling and expand our penetration in productive stores as a result we experienced higher internal margins and increase products sellthrough at higher aurs across most of our classification with less promotional activities early spring leads on swim and tees have been the strong product performance categories we will continue to apply this strategy while driving top line growth as well as original penguin as a full collection in tops and bottoms there by guarding our penetration and adding higher productive stores at the same time were focusing our marketing on digital and feel that this effort will enable us to align with the original penguin consumer that spends an increasing amount of time connected to this end turning to the womens and beginning with laundry during the quarter we consciously lowered our instore inventory to give us a fast return this along with our customer focus on fashion newness versus price and a shift to online assisted us to improve margins we just completed our fall  market and were very excited about the plans weve received from our core retail partners and have a confidence that the new managements we have in laundry is on track for growth in the second half of the year rafaella performed above our expectation mainly driven by the early timing of shipments reflecting retailer supporting the new product initiatives at retail we saw a sales trend in the april driven by our new initiatives including the introduction of weekend getaway collection products a traditional company product for rafaella consumer in fact all of rafaella department stores supported this initiative with the weekend getaway launch into  stores at belk bonton dillards boscov and lord  taylor we will begin delivering monthly capitals of the weekend getaway going forward giving customers something new to browse and buy each time sheshops overall we expect the retail environment to remain challenging with the possibility of additional store closures and retail bankruptcies expected in the usa even with this backdrop we remain confident in our ability to deliver core sales growth as we have aligned our brand and our businesses with higher productive door and the expansion internationally and t direct to consumer it is also important to note that we have a diversified brand portfolio diversified channel and we offer niche lifestyle to service the mass change stores department stores and special markets as a company we are very disciplined and focused on managing inventory tightly and delivering product closer to the time of the need while providing a continuous flow of new innovative products to market to deliver our growth and profitability goals with that i would now like to turn the call over to david to review our financial guidance david rattner good morning everyone in the first quarter as we noted in our press release we recorded revenues and earnings per share that exceeded our guidance consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled  million which was ahead of our guidance reflecting strength in our core businesses with the earlier shipment of spring merchandize oscar just spoke about as compared to the prior year revenues declined driven by retailers preference to receive products closer to need to increase their churn which we spoke about on our q call in march as well as negative foreign exchange and the reduction in owned stores which benefited profitability by segment revenue in our mens sportswear and swim segment totaled  million as compared to  million in prior year increases were noted in our core golf apparel nike swim and other brands revenue in our womens sportswear segment totaled  million as compared to  million in the year ago period increases in our rafaella business were offset by planned reductions in laundry as discussed by oscar directtoconsumer revenue totaled  million as compared to  million in the prior year mostly due to the closing of  stores last year that resulted in a much more profitable store base store comp was down  in the quarter but comp traffic was down  for the quarter as we focused on the customer experience by door also our store comp margins were up nearly  for the quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our product assortment total dtc comp sales were down  yet comp margin dollars were flat reflecting higher aur based on a twofold approach one being internal pricing strategy and two moving away from highly promotional events overall we were very pleased with our performance in a tough environment licensing revenues totaled  million as compared to  million in the prior year as discussed last year we transitioned from two of our license partners one brought inhouse and one a new partnership as george has commented this was part of our strategy to elevate our brands globally as we expected this transition reduce revenues in this segment of our business versus last year moving on to total company results beginning with gross margin we continue to be very pleased with our gross margin expansion as margins expanded by  basis points versus prior years adjusted basis continued solid performance in our mens collection golf apparel and nike swim businesses were additionally assisted by improved margins in our directtoconsumer business we also continue to benefit from efficiencies in our supplychain infrastructure sga totaled  million for the quarter as compared to an adjusted amount of approximately  million in the prior year sga in our current fiscal quarter included  million of anticipated cost that are not expected to continue excluding this sga was in line with prior year we are pleased with our cost discipline to effectively manage increases in wages and other inflationary cost that are closer to  to  per year turning to the balance sheet inventories continue to be managed extremely tight and believe our in great shape to support our forward sales forecast our inventory discipline enabled us to pose a net debt to total capitalization of  as compared to  in the yearago period this places us in a very comfortable position to support the expansion of our businesses looking to quarter two we expect revenues in the range of  million to  million compared to  million in the yearago period we expect revenue growth in our mens collection and golf apparel businesses and also expect to benefit from the continued roll out of nike swim in europe and latin america and further expansion in global golf brands we see gross margin approximately  for the quarter which reflects higher margin shipments in q due to customer risk sga is expected to be relatively consistent with adjusted prior year levels reflecting our ability to offset inflationary cost pressures due to the plans shift our pretax earnings are tax rate is expected to be higher in q versus last year which is expected to negatively impact the quarter by  to  per share compared to prior year for the above reasons we expect earnings per share to be approximately  to  for the second quarter as compared to an adjusted  in the prior year as we look at the remainder of the year we see continued headwinds from lack of consumer traffic and macroeconomic issues we feel that we are positioned well in terms of our product focus and our execution and performance accordingly we are maintaining are guidance for revenues of  million to  million and adjusted earnings per share for the year of  to  this continues to reflect the gross margin rate between  to  despite the challenges in the global market we continue to focus on controlling those items within our control elevating our brand and improving our profitability with that i will turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions well go first to ronald bookbinder with coker  palmer ronald bookbinder looking now at the environment you talked a lot about the shift to ecom but is that really picking up all the merchandize or do you think industrywide there is just too much product out there also not just too many stores but just too much product oscar feldenkreis i think it‚Äôs a blend of both i think that definitely ecommerce is growing i think the challenge that we‚Äôre seeing and the improvement that were seeing as we experience with some other channels and distributions that were actually seeing a shift of one the product is actually being delivered which in retailers are starting to operate on less inventory in the store and focusing more on the turn and delivering product quicker which is similar to what some of the vertical retailers have been successful doing offering more deliveries more frequently ronald bookbinder and you guys talked a lot about europe and your focus on building up the infrastructure there but do you think the channel shift that we‚Äôre seeing in us to ecommerce do you see the hitting europe sometime in the next year or two george feldenkreis thank you ron for your comments we don‚Äôt see that happening that quickly number one there are really no major department store europe outside of indiscernible spain and im taking about continental europe in the uk of course there are large department stores on which very similar business with the us or in europe its only spain and to some degree germany not as important as in united states so its harder to substitute the small time indiscernible prevalent in all of europe when it comes to amazon et cetera et cetera so we don‚Äôt  we see the same  there is no question that the european ecommerce as a matter of fact in many cases and some countries has a higher percentage of the market than in the united states but it‚Äôs a different situation brands are still more important in europe than in the united states although other total they represented total smaller percent of the total market and there is no question that we have some brands that have a lot of appeal to the europeans like callaway nike and even penguin and perry is a good brand there from before so we see europe as a very fertile market for us to grow and when i mean europe i mean all the countries in europe including the middle east et cetera et cetera ronald bookbinder and on the jack nicklaus to that mass merchant how much of a revenue benefit do you think that will be for q opening up over  stores oscar feldenkreis well its already included in our numbers revenue numbers for this year and we hope that that will perform well early performance has been very strong and hopefully that will continue that momentum will continue and hopefully for next year and possibly q as we start again the spring season well be able to gain further market share so were very excited with the jack nicklaus launch and well have more updates in q in terms of what other additional opportunities that we see with the golf segment ronald bookbinder okay and lastly i think you had some notes that recallable in april how are you guys looking at that given how strong your balance sheet is with cash being generated george feldenkreis were not  at this moment we dont have plans to call it frankly we are waiting for  hopefully one day well have a change in the tax situation and we have funds in europe that through our european corporation that there we can use for growth in europe so depending on how we see our  the needs of our growth in europe initiatives we can bring in enough money to pay down the debt so that is  that is really what were waiting for were waiting for a few months this stage of the market we feel its more prudent to be on a very strong cash position for anything that might happen for good or bad there are going to be big opportunities on ma i feel because many of the players we talk about the smaller wholesale business general were talking about the number of companies that are not going to make it theyre going to be looking to be acquired so there should be some up on that at prices that we have not seen in years operator and well go next to eric beder with wunderlich eric beder you guys have done a great job of being very innovative with the product when you look out how do you keep that competitive edge in having just being like kind of the leader with these active brands and some of these brands here in terms of product offerings oscar feldenkreis well eric thats a very good question we have a strong organization overseas we have a strong merchandizing team and we also have a development team in asia that is very focused on helping us create innovative product and we constantly our merchandizing team oversea is constantly reviewing what all new possibilities are out there to incorporate within our sportswear brands and our where best selling product today as ive mentioned in just alone in golf and some of the introduction in performance fabrics into even perry ellis which we just introduced a fourway stretch pant under perry ellis performing extremely well and that for us has you know ive always believed product is king you have product consumers will buy regardless eric beder great and when you look at amazon and your own online ecommerce how is that going and where do you think it should go over going longerterm george feldenkreis well ecommerce of us has been very strong ecommerce even if you look at just this first quarter alone thirdparty ecommerce was up plus  and just alone in golf alone ecommerce was plus  this quarter so were very excited with the opportunities as you know we mentioned last year that we invested heavily into photography studio inhouse as well as now we are going to be adding videography which will allows us to create more videos for our thirdparty and as well as our online ecommerce sites which will allow us to have more  the consumers have more knowledge about the product and as well as well as we are upping our game when it comes to social marketing and market digital marketing as well but we feel that there still a lot of run room for us to begin to open up additional ecommerce sites of our own within our portfolio of brands we are planning on launching a laundry ecommerce side in the second half of the year which we are very excited as you know was a dress market today almost  of the dress market is done online and we feel that this could be a great opportunity for us and we are in the process now of looking at other golf brands that we launch online as well we feel that dtc online definitely has a potential to be a  million business for us over the next three to five years eric beder question for david in terms of inventories youve done an outstanding job in terms of reducing inventories around how much more can you go david rattner well as george mentioned our inventories are in excellent shape right now we ended at a  million for the current quarter compared to running  million prior quarter we our turns  our approaching are right at four times at this point and given where we are at were comfortable with our inventory levels throughout the remainder of the year and we see inventories ending flat yearoveryear from  million to  million eric beder okay and different kind of question you talked about  we obviously know theres a lot of disruption right now in the retail environment how aggressively and what are you guys doing to make sure that you are paid and that you have a deal with some of this retail bankruptcies or these companies loosing financial ability to pay debt david rattner we on the accounting  on the ar side we whatever  i would say were pretty well funded with either a factoring or an insurance or were carrying our own paper but i would feel that our account receivables outstanding are in a pretty good shape oscar feldenkreis our receivables are  were very current right now we are in really excellent state with our receivables and we do monitor some of the riskier accounts very closely making sure that we are not over extending ourselves from a credit perspective so we have a very diligent eye on receivables and certain customers operator we will go next to greg pendy with sidoti greg pendy my question i guess as you guys were early to see the downturn in the store base and took the pain awhile ago but now on the call you mentioned the possibility of opening of new stores where they make economic sense can you just give us a sense of how you see in this environment what is economic sense in the new store opening do you look on cash on cash returns or how are you viewing a potential new store and what are the hurdles youre thinking about oscar feldenkreis were opening up more  were looking at doors very very cautiously based upon the analysis that were doing they have to profitable i would within the first year were looking pop ups versus signing longterm leases there is more pop opportunities we just opened up a pop up in aspen colorado which were very excited its about a six month opportunity and if were successful we will stay in that location its small its a  square foot store so its substantially smaller than the  or  square feet that weve had before so were looking up pop ups were making sure that were in the right location as we know in real estate location location is very important and that‚Äôs the approach were taking we‚Äôre not going to be crazy opening up stores weve opened up some new stores in the airport here in miami with original penguin and its been extremely successful generating over a  a square foot and we see that airport stores as a great opportunity as you know more there is more and more travelers today than ever before and we feel that could be a good opportunity for us in the long run operator operator instructions we will go next to ed yruma with keybanc capital markets unidentified analyst this is mac on ed obviously department stores have been challenged were wondering how youre feeling about orders moving forward specifically are you seeing your partners become even more conservative or is it more so just status quo and similarly for sporting goods lot of consolidation and disruption in this channel how do you feel about your product there what‚Äôs working and whats not and finally can you give us an update on your swim business in the channel thank you oscar feldenkreis okay we will take question number one regarding department stores department stores have been planned flat they started  we plan the business since last year almost six to seven months in advance and were planning our business with them in certain categories flat in other areas up but of course that goes by geography weve seen sales in the south east south west let say united states continuing to do well so that‚Äôs where the emphasis is going versus the mid tier of the  the mid zone of the states geographically have been probably most challenged by because of weather et cetera that many have reported but we‚Äôre planning our business flat to a slight increase but its all depends on the brand and the actual retailer when it comes to the sporting goods channel golf is growing as i mentioned and we continue to see opportunities in the sporting good side the retailers that have exited or gone out of business in the sporting good side we were never selling them much except sports authority and nike swimwear where a lot of that market share has been picked up by the other retailers that are strong out there today either via ecommerce or via brick and mortar so we feel positive about the consolidation and less stores nike is an extreme is very extreme powerful brand and i would say that we are the leader when it comes to swimwear for all genders within the sporting goods channel and our business is up and were trending up were having a great season weve introduced a lot of innovative products like stretch and swimwear which has been brand new and that‚Äôs been very disruptive from the nonstretch product that has been out there and were seeing basically its all about innovation and servicing the customer both from a mobile digital perspective to brickandmortar our swim business has been excellent as i mentioned first quarter was very strong we delivered a lot more swimwear in q and q this year and last year which has were fueling the sales of our growth both from sporting goods to the traditional department stores to chain stores to ecommerce sites our swim business continues to be extremely strong and very dominant and the same applies to our international business our partners like with asos and in mexico canada our business with nike swimwear has been veryvery strong unidentified analyst thank you and so for the mens business are you seeing any new trends i know you said linen was strong but i believe that was also the case last year is there anything new youre seeing this year fashion wise oscar feldenkreis well i think the disruption this year in the newness and mens wear has really been print both the knits and wovens as well as stretch and bottoms has caused the consumer to go out there and replenish their bottoms wardrobe once they try a pair of stretch comfortable pant maybe a pant or a short thats what creating the replenishment needs for a consumer to go out there and buy something that they dont have in their wardrobe today so our bottoms business as i mentioned both in golf and perry ellis are extremely strong and we see that momentum very positive going forward and were applying the same technology by the way to our womens rafaella bottoms business which has been very strong because we adapted some of the technology in our mens side to our rafaella bottoms side operator and with no further questions in the queue id like to turn the conference back over to george feldenkreis for any additional or closing remarks george

delgado says referring to the fashion institute of technology part of new york‚Äôs state university system they‚Äôre members of the inaugural class of  students at mfi a twoyear associate degree

with manufacturing warehouses major department stores like burdines jordan marsh jefferson ward jackson byrons which eventually became j byrons and richards dotted downtown national retailers like sears and jcpenney had offices here providing local apparel lines manufactured in miami access to wide distribution some of the major brands included suave shoes d‚Äôaccord twins swim cover girl and tail much of miami‚Äôs fashion golden era can be attributed to the influx of cuban refugees in miami ‚Äútens of thousands of cuban women came to miami with experience in apparel they were pattern makers and sewers‚Äù says george feldenkreis founder and executive chairman of perry ellis international who came to miami from cuba in  ‚Äúlatins propelled the boom in miami‚Äôs garment industry in wynwood and hialeah because the labor force from americans was not there‚Äù the industry fell into sharp decline in the mids in large part due to globalization and new technology with cheaper labor available offshore and open trade agreements ‚Äúthe economy changed‚Äù parsons says ‚Äúthe omni mall which was very high end closed other retailers closed people were leaving the designers left and manufacturing stopped‚Äù the us textile and apparel workforce was hit hard dropping from  million workers in  to  million in  a decline of  percent according to the department of labor in miami this left a challenging landscape for new designers especially with the labor intensive and essential skill of sewing in short supply ‚Äúa lot of the skills needed to make garments have disappeared‚Äù feldenkreis says ‚Äúthere are very few people that know how to make apparel it‚Äôs an art those people have disappeared‚Äù despite these challenges successful enduring miami designers have emerged including rene ruiz silvia tcherassi mayda cisneros and julian chang all of whom serve on mfi‚Äôs advisory board still more young designers are breaking into the industry every day and thriving these include companies like eberjey alexis del toro miansai style mafia and bammies today miami‚Äôs fashion industry is buoyed by events like fashion week swim and funkshion fashion week as well as a salient swim bridal and accessories industry it‚Äôs one of the few metropolitan areas where retail is growing thanks to developments like the design district and brickell city centre there are also law firms like foley  lardner llp dedicated to the fashion industry and professional networking organizations like fashion group international according to the beacon council the creative design industry in miami of which fashion is a niche sector employs  people at  companies with an economic impact of  billion in recent years the local industry has seen a pivot away from overseas manufacturing with a desire for ‚Äúmade in miami‚Äù products evidenced by an uptick of brands headquartered in miami with both retail storefronts and manufacturing facilities ‚Äî and these businesses want to grow ‚Äúit represents a true industry cluster‚Äù says pamela fuertesberti vice president of international economic development programs at the beacon council ‚Äúwe have everything here manufacturing sourcing distribution warehouse styling development it‚Äôs not just one aspect brands want to have their whole team close by so everything is interconnected‚Äù ‚Äúthe industry is poised to flourish‚Äù molinary says ‚Äúyou have the world looking at miami it‚Äôs young vibrant creative cosmopolitan and international with all of this energy happening at this time what we‚Äôve heard from the industry is that in order for it to grow we need an educational infrastructure or it won‚Äôt be able to reach its full potential‚Äù and to understand its potential it‚Äôs wise to examine its history here‚Äôs a look at some of the pioneers of miami‚Äôs fashion and apparel industry for decades they‚Äôve endured a fluctuating economy and the industry‚Äôs shifting landscape by seizing opportunities diversifying products recalibrating strategies carving out a niche and reinventing themselves their leaders have demonstrated a sharp understanding of the industry with an eye towards future trends and have made vital adjustments along the way allowing them to endure and thrive a motherdaughter story the story of miami‚Äôs fashion and apparel industry is much like the city itself a story of human migration and family maria ‚Äúmarita‚Äù srebnick‚Äôs parents arrived in cuba in  jews fleeing eastern europe‚Äôs pogroms her father from poland and her mother from the ukraine ‚Äúhow did they end up in cuba you had to have money to go to mexico and more money to go to the us if you had no money you were left in havana‚Äù says srebnick  her mother sofia built a warehouse and factory in havana making zippers manufacturing machines and dying undergarments that she exported to south america it was march  when the government put a soviet flag on top of her building ‚Äúshe went up with a pair of scissors and cut it down‚Äù srebnick recalls ‚Äúmy father could smell communism coming‚Äù soon after cuba‚Äôs new regime froze every account and confiscated the business the family eventually reunited in new york city in  where sofia went to work as a floor lady at a zipper factory and srebnick‚Äôs father jaime worked in a warehouse in  with  saved between the two of them marita and sofia moved to miami and opened scott notions specializing in zipper assembly and distribution their first customer was sportailor a cubanowned miami apparel company still in business today with a purchase order for  in zippers ¬†marita srebnick owner of scott notions checks on some zippers just out of the product line this is a  year old family business founded by her mother after leaving cuba and returning from new york in the seventieth in wynwood on tuesday october  pedro portal  pportalmiamiheraldcom in  the ykk group a japanese company with us headquarters in macon georgia group of manufacturing companies that is the world‚Äôs largest zipper manufacturer approached their operation and scott notions became the company‚Äôs first assembler that‚Äôs when srebnick‚Äôs cousin ben horenstein joined the business handling sales when scott notions started out there were five competitors in miami making zippers srebnick‚Äôs partnership with ykk whose zippers went on to monopolize the industry played a vital role in pushing scott notions to the top in the s their competitors began going out of business levi‚Äôs came calling in  and srebnick answered by flying to their headquarters in san francisco the next morning ‚Äúi tell my children that when i went to levi‚Äôs plaza there‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant called il fornaio for breakfast i sat there and looked at the levi‚Äôs building and started to cry i said how did i come to be here a cuban refugee with no money and i‚Äôm going to be a supplier to levi‚Äôs‚Äù with a wry matteroffact smile she adds ‚Äúand we were‚Äù scott notions supplied levi‚Äôs with ykk zippers for a decade making  million annually in sales at its height in  the industry took a sharp downturn as manufacturing and production migrated overseas and companies like levi‚Äôs followed to stay afloat srebnick diversified becoming a onestop shop for all products catering to the apparel industry as companies went out of business she took on their products she now supplies everything from elastic thread buttons poly bags and hangers in addition to zippers to about  clients ‚Äúdo we sell a lot no but we survive‚Äù srebnick says they‚Äôve maintained a competitive edge by being one of the only operations to assemble jacket zippers with a machine that sofia bought in  and to this day jacket zippers comprise  percent of their zipper orders they‚Äôve also stayed nimble by developing a program to supply home sewing and arts and crafts operations in the caribbean with smaller quantities of thread and elastic so what keeps srebnick‚Äôs passion for the business alive as scott notions celebrates its th anniversary this month she says ‚Äúi love coming here everyday because my mom started it‚Äù carving a niche originally from cuba richard behar‚Äôs father simon moved to new york in the s where he spent  years as an executive at a fabric company he moved to miami in  to launch colorama fashions specializing in women‚Äôs wear in  richard founded capitol clothing corporation with the help of his father initially his brand little baron produced fashionable coordinated sets for boys which was a void in the children‚Äôs wear market they also had a secondary line of novelty uniforms in a variety of themes including park ranger police officer firefighter boat captain safari and military outfits but this was a smaller segment of the company their first break came a year into business when a buyer for the armyairforce exchange placed a large order distributing their clothing line to military bases in the us and abroad in  behar met a buyer from the san diego zoo at a trade show in las vegas who requested he create a junior zookeeper uniform ‚Äúsince then they‚Äôve been one of our best accounts‚Äù he says starting in  behar noticed that many ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù children‚Äôs retail stores were going out of business and the showrooms catering to the industry were disappearing ‚Äúit was time to refocus the direction of the company for continued growth‚Äù he says that‚Äôs when their novelty uniforms became a profitable niche today they‚Äôre distributed to  retailers including the grand canyon and everglades national park in large part through eastern national a concessionaire company with more than  gift shops at national parks and museums their products are also distributed to law enforcement uniform and army navy stores ‚Äúit‚Äôs a segment that‚Äôs really grown for us‚Äù behar says ‚Äúbecause each style has its own unique theme each has its own market‚Äù ¬†richard behar right

uniforms through a shifting economy where many of his competitors went out of business due to manufacturing moving overseas behar has managed to use americanmade fabric and keep the company‚Äôs manufacturing local their apparel is cut onsite in their allapattah warehouse and sent out to sewing shops in hialeah ‚Äúour customers love the idea that our products are ‚Äòmade in usa‚Äô it adds perceived value for the consumer‚Äù behar says ‚Äúwe have very strict quality control with all the sewing shops that work for us the garments are then sent back to our location to be coordinated as sets and shipped out‚Äù in the end children‚Äôs fashion has kept behar young at heart ‚Äúi love the business it‚Äôs like my hobby‚Äù he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs fun making children‚Äôs wear‚Äù a fashion family incubates new talent if necessity is the mother of invention then reinvention is the key to longevity in miami‚Äôs fashion and apparel business no one understands this better than andy varat whose family has been in the industry for four generations with his family‚Äôs origins in russia his father morton moved from new york to miami in  to found cover girl a successful publicly held women‚Äôs wear brand that he ran until  when he retired the line in  during cover girl‚Äôs tenure morton built a squarefoot facility with warehouse and office space at  nw st street that would also become the headquarters of tail founded by andy and his sister cheryl singer in  the fashionable women‚Äôs activewear line grew to become the leading brand in golf and tennis with  million in sales at its peak varat and singer sold tail in  and kept the facilities today the building is something of a fashion incubator home to eight independent businesses including a cutting service and sewing house run by tony fernandez and florence kemper respectively who have worked with the varats since the early days many of the apparel businesses a‚Äônue ligne top secret society lucky in love and louis at home are helmed by members of the varat family ‚Äúit‚Äôs a wonderful family business‚Äù says lois varat andy‚Äôs sister who founded a‚Äônue ligne an elevated women‚Äôs basics line with her daughter jodi bondy in  ‚Äúit works well we‚Äôre independent but we‚Äôre there for each other‚Äù the building‚Äôs most highprofile tenant is lingerie and loungewear line eberjey whose operations occupy about threequarters of the space founded by mariela rovito and ali mejia in  the brand has developed a cult following and is found in  specialty stores worldwide  top tier department stores and at three flagship boutiques between miami and newport beach california with a fourth opening in december in new york city ‚Äúthe building was set up for this kind of business already so it made a lot of sense for us‚Äù says rovito of moving eberjey‚Äôs headquarters to the  building in  when their need for space tripled ‚Äúit has sufficient office space in the front with warehouse space in the back which is actually really hard to find‚Äù while varat no longer operates a fashion line himself he‚Äôs become a generous consultant and underwriter of emerging designers and businesses most recently hosting german designer jens werner who collaborated with shakealeg to create avantgarde designs out of old ship sails to raise money for the nonprofit dedicated to teaching the disabled and underserved communities how to sail werner‚Äôs line will debut at shakealeg‚Äôs th anniversary art of sail event on saturday at  pm at the historic coast guard hangar in coconut grove with tickets available for  ‚Äúpersonally i‚Äôm smart‚Äù quips varat ‚Äúi‚Äôm out of the business i just help people try to become successful‚Äù the brand blockbuster before perry ellis international became a  million global fashion titan it started with a penniless cuban refugee who came to miami in  at age  with nothing ‚Äúi originally sold window glass to cruise boats‚Äù says george feldenkreis founder and executive chairman of pei of his first job in miami it was  when he and his brother herman founded supreme international an apparel line of school uniforms and guayabera shirts sold at sears jcpenney and burdines even as miami‚Äôs manufacturing and retail industry boomed in the s feldenkreis‚Äô approach was global importing goods from japan at competitive prices ‚Äúthe local industry here was based upon a specialty store mentality very small‚Äù says oscar feldenkreis george‚Äôs son who joined the business in  and now serves as ceo and president of pei ‚Äúmost people that had factories worried more about factories and production than going overseas and trying to produce the same product at cheaper price points it was challenging in those days if you didn‚Äôt have a niche or a brand or an opportunity to go into a customer the challenge was other companies were not able to evolve‚Äù in  supreme international introduced feldini a fashionforward men‚Äôs wear brand to the market a year later the company reached  million in annual revenues and in  it went public on the nasdaq stock exchange this marked a period of aggressive acquisition and licensing of brands which would separate their company from the pack not only locally but worldwide ‚Äúi was very fixed in getting brands because i felt that was the only way we‚Äôd be able to sell big quantities‚Äù george feldenkreis says ‚Äúyou needed brands a product that the consumer knows is fashionable but every time you buy it there is continuity in the fit and the quality that‚Äôs what allowed us to get into department stores‚Äù in  supreme international acquired men‚Äôs wear brand perry ellis and changed its name to perry ellis international today pei is composed of  brands including original penguin cubavera nike swim callaway golf and laundry by shelli segal it was george‚Äôs acuity in forecasting the industry‚Äôs evolution that led to the company‚Äôs overwhelming growth while competitors stayed small and eventually went out of business today pei continues to look to the future of consumer buying habits and the disruptive nature of the internet social media and new technology to that end they‚Äôve invested in their ecommerce talent and built an inhouse dual bay photography studio at their headquarters in doral which allows them to instantaneously push product online to their websites and amazon ‚Äúit‚Äôs not only about the capacity to make garments anymore‚Äù george says ‚Äúit‚Äôs also about the capacity to create fashion and sales on a direct basis to the consumer that‚Äôs going to be critical to the future you need the capabilities in computers and new sciences to be able to reach those consumers in the united states and all over the world‚Äù oscar adds ‚Äúmobility is the future

twitter oscar feldenkreis president and chief operating officer of perry ellis international is on a mission that extends far beyond continuing to increase company profits that is almost a fait accompli for this talented entrepreneur with a strong vision a creative edge and a passion for his work since joining his father george feldenkreis founder of this leading company in men‚Äôs apparel oscar has taken the company to new heights expanding product categories acquiring trademarks growing the customer base and in  taking the company public soaring profits to an unprecedented level heritage oscar feldenkreis ceo of perry ellis international contributes to a number of jewish causesshare for your average joe that would be quite a feat but feldenkreis is not average by any means nor is he one to rest on his laurels instead he works tirelessly to give back to the jewish community the state of israel and various medical institutions committed to research after all that is his family‚Äôs heritage fleeing communist cuba when the young oscar was only  year old his parents found refuge and later fortune on the shores of miami beach fla his father became very active in the latin division of the area‚Äôs jewish federation and soon became its president holding meetings at the family home today the younger feldenkreis sitting in his house overlooking biscayne bay in miami recounts listening to his father at the meetings and participating in the federation dinners as a young boy he now holds a cabinet position at the greater miami jewish federation and each year he tries to donate more money than the year before ‚Äúbeing successful you have to be able to share and our family is very big on that ‚Äî on being able to give back as much as possible‚Äù feldenkreis said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre very much involved in jewish causes where i would say we give a big percentage of our donations‚Äù each year feldenkreis donates tens of thousands of dollars to miami‚Äôs jewish federation he also purchases vast amounts of israel bonds to help bolster israel‚Äôs economy and he is contributing to the funding of the expansion of temple menorah in miami beach his nonjewish philanthropic efforts include donations to the university of miamijackson memorial hospital feldenkreis contributes to these organizations as a private individual and not on behalf of perry ellis though he is driven to expand the business not so much for his own personal benefit but rather to increase his ability to give with his philanthropic goals in mind failure has never been an option for feldenkreis in fact it‚Äôs failure that he fears ‚Äúi think that businessmen that have that type of fear will always be successful because they are going to try as hard as possible to make sure that they do not fail‚Äù feldenkreis said perry ellis international achieved a great measure of success and expansion under his leadership when feldenkreis joined his father‚Äôs apparel business in  he started a pants line that he called feldini an italian spinoff of his last name and he started developing what he calls ‚Äúthe bottom business‚Äù with the same levelheaded practicality that he exuded during our interview feldenkreis recognized that the average american consumer did not want to pay  to  for pants made in italy he then realized that there was an opportunity to develop pants manufactured in korea that made of  wool or woolen blends would sell for only  to  it was this move that put the company in a relationship with federated department stores which in its day comprised the large department stores that dominated the apparel industry the momentum grew from there feldenkreis was responsible for the company‚Äôs tremendous growth spurt during the s with profits rising to  million in  from  million only a year earlier he and his father decided to take the company public on the nasdaq exchange turning the company‚Äôs fortunes then  million to an astonishing  million in one year‚Äôs time ‚Äúwe started to grow almost  every single year‚Äù feldenkreis said in  the company acquired its first true brands and today it boasts a composite of such familiar labels as perry ellis manhattan john henry mundo del marco axis and treaco st rafael to name a few perry ellis international is also the licensee for pga tour golf and holds the license for all categories of nike swimwear feldenkreis is always on the move seeking out new opportunities for his miamiheadquartered company with multiple offices in asia and on both american coasts ‚Äúour culture is very entrepreneurial we‚Äôre about growth‚Äù he said no one can say that feldenkreis is all work and no play to the contrary he can be spotted each hanukkah in aspen colo with his wife of  years and their three daughters ranging in age from  to  ‚Äúwe light hanukkah candles in aspen‚Äù he said the five family members also enjoy boating and they travel to europe together during the summers when at home they enjoy traditional sabbath dinners and keep kosher feldenkreis said with pride having attended hebrew academy of miami beach feldenkreis is a strong believer in passing down jewish values to his children who attended jewish day schools in fact he begins each day by donning tefillin feldenkreis is very active at temple menorah a large wellestablished conservative synagogue in miami beach as a board member he serves on a committee charged with building an updated synagogue and a new social hall ‚Äúfor the last  years i have been doing the israel bonds campaign drive at temple menorah‚Äù he said feldenkreis recently ascended the podium as the honored guest of the  israel bonds dinner where he spoke about the complex issues facing israel today and in the future ‚Äúit‚Äôs a very troublesome situation‚Äù feldenkreis said describing the challenges that israel faces and the breadth of israel‚Äôs enemies which he said reach far beyond the palestinians his commitment to israel is well evidenced from  through  feldenkreis served as chairman of miami‚Äôs israelamerica chamber of commerce helping businesspeople look for opportunities to import and export products between the united states and israel ‚Äúi think the biggest issue we have within the israelamerica chamber of commerce is that we need more people involved‚Äù he said ‚Äúthe local israelis that have been very successful here should be much more involved‚Äù one of his personal goals is to take a more active role in federation activities ‚Äúi believe as an american jew that i have to give a big percentage of our commitments to the jewish federation and support for the state of israel‚Äù feldenkreis explained he urges others to do the same ‚Äúthe us will continue to support the state of israel‚Ä¶ as long as it sees a strong zionistamerican movement for the support of israel on a philanthropic basis i think that there is a lot of need for american jews that are not involved and have the power and the wherewithal to be able to give back to the state of israel‚Äù he asserted ‚Äúi believe that that‚Äôs something that we need to work on‚Äù the forwards independent journalism depends on donations from
