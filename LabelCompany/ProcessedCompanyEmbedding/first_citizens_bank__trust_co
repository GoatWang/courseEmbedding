weve made a commitment to protecting your financial information with some of the top internet security technology in the industry however your information may still be at risk if your personal or professional computer is compromised by a virus or malware to learn more about how to help protect your computer from malicious online software click here what we do our online banking system is designed to protect your information and privacy here are some of the security measures we have in place strong encryption information exchanged between your computer and our web server is secured through encryption encryption converts the information into a form that is unreadable as it travels along the internet you must have a browser that supports strong encryption to access the system in technical terms the browser must support bit encryption password protection to protect your password our system will periodically request that you change your password when changing your password you will be shown whether your password is considered weak medium or strong strong passwords are harder for a fraudster to guess please do not reveal your password to anyone and please commit your password to memory rather than writing it down where others may find it automatic logout you should always log out of the online banking facility when you are done if you forget our system will automatically log you out after a period of time protecting your privacy in order to protect your personal information you may be asked to enter security credentials before gaining access to pages that contain your address phone number and login credentials providing these credentials will confirm your identity so that only you can see and modify your personal information fraud protection in order to protect you against fraudulent transactions you may be asked to enter security credentials for any transaction that moves funds out of the bank for example a transfer to an external account or a bill payment what you can do first citizens is dedicated to maintaining the highest possible level of online security we consider it a great responsibility to protect the financial information you have entrusted to us however your financial information may still be at risk if your personal or professional computer is compromised by a virus or malicious software known as malware malware can be placed on your computer in multiple ways including clicking a link on a fake email made to look like it comes from a trusted company – often a bank everyone has an important role to play when it comes to information security and protecting confidential data we’ve sent you this message to remind you of some steps you can take to shield your computer from malware we recommend that you seek professional computer assistance to enable the following precautions use the internet cautiously internet activity including email can be intercepted and viewed by others phishing is an attempt by internet fraudsters to lure you into giving confidential information allowing them to gain access to your financial information use caution with email attachments and web links they could contain malware never open email attachments or click links from people you dont know  just delete them be careful opening email attachments or clicking on links from people you do know their computer may have been compromised and they may be unknowingly participating in the spread of malware be aware of email fraud senders of emails may have crafted the emails in such a way that they appear to be from someone known to the business a common occurrence is to make the email look like it was sent by the cfo or even the ceo of the business given this possibility the “from” address should not be trusted recently fraudsters posing as vendors clients or employees have begun sending businesses emails requesting wire transfers the business initiates a wire based on instructions in the email only to learn that their vendor client or employees email account had been compromised and the wire request was fraudulent fraudsters have also convinced businesses to update payment information for legitimate vendors please note that sending a wire or initiating any transaction based solely on an email request can be very risky we encourage you to verify such requests by contacting your vendors clients and employees using an alternative method such as a phone call to a known valid number for more information please review the fbi alert at httpwwwicgovmediaaspx notify first citizens if you receive a request to provide confidential data if you are using business online banking advantage® and encounter different functionality wording pictures or text than what you are used to – or if you are being prompted for information that you do not normally have to provide – contact us immediately this may be an indication that your computer has been infected by malware if you have concerns that your computer is compromised in any way stop using it for sensitive transactions until you can have it safely cleaned use antivirus and firewall products on all computers we suggest that you install antivirus products on your computer and enable the firewall features on your computer and network equipment there are several reliable commercial products available at low or no cost regularly install operating system and software updates it is extremely important that you make sure your computer has all of the most current security updates set your computer to automatically update your operating system via microsoft update windows update or apple software update as well as your addins such as adobe flash and adobe reader with all of the latest security patches each product generally has an option to “check for updates” automatically do not use operating systems or other software that are no longer supported security of such products is no longer being maintained continued use puts you at risk of compromise this includes windows xp and old browsers such as ie  and older regularly back up data on your computer backing up data regularly ensures that sensitive documents and files are safe secure and recoverable in the event of a hardware failure or malware intrusion for optimal protection we recommend rotating multiple backups with at least one backup to a disconnected storage medium and an offsite location at all times take note of any strange or unusual behavior if you notice that your computer is running slower than usual or if you start seeing strange behavior such as unexpected popup windows or requests for never before requested information at login or transaction time this may be an indication of a potential problem contact your computer support professional to diagnose and remove any malware establish a dedicated computer for sensitive transactions if possible dedicate a single computer for use by everyone in your home or office for conducting sensitive transactions such as online banking issuing wires or making ach payments if a workstation computer is used for online banking we recommend that it not be used for general web browsing or social networking use bob advantage chk from a separate device for maximum security we recommend that the chk application be installed on a either an iphone or android smart phone or on a separate pc desktop from that used to login to bob advantage monitor and reconcile your accounts daily to make sure your accounts have not been compromised reconcile your financial transactions on a regular basis if anything looks incorrect or out of the ordinary contact first citizens immediately using the phone numbers listed below do not access your bank accounts at internet cafes or from public wifi hotspots public internet connections that you find in airports coffee shops and internet cafes usually do not have the level of security necessary to protect your sensitive financial information rebuild your computer if it becomes infected although you may have run several antivirus scans against your computer industry experts recommend that a complete rebuild of the computer is the only sure way to remove the threat completely we realize that this is not a convenient solution however we appreciate how sensitive your data and finances are and want you to be aware of every possible precaution you can take to protect your private information please call fcbbiz  monday  saturday  am   pm et if you have any questions or concerns first citizens takes online security very seriously thank you for

ask our experts expert’s answers how do banks work how do i choose a bank what does it mean to be fdic insured how do banks work by john kiernan personal finance editor the manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself banks exist to solve that problem and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the italian renaissance the crusades or even earlier depending on which historians you consult more specifically banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit cds to other customers who repay the money with interest over time depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons  banks offer safekeeping borne from fdic insurance and  banks pay interest on deposits allowing funds to grow over time banks in turn make money by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits banks can have other sources of revenue as well including investments fees on various services and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance in addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms for example banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve how do i choose a bank by odysseas papadimitriou wallethub ceo when it comes to selecting a bank the options can be overwhelming in past generations it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster these days you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an onlineonly bank that has no branch offices at all special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking introductory interest rates or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account but before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you do you need a brickandmortar location you may find yourself in need of a safedeposit box or if questions arise you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with facetoface communication if you need access to a real building staffed by live people prioritize your bank’s location and hours bankers’ hours are notoriously short and if your workday overlaps them completely you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home so that you can slip in at lunchtime or you might want to look for a bank with better hours are you a technophile you may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an onlineonly bank or bank account by the same token you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements keeping tabs on your account balance electronically and using mobile apps to locate atms that are within your network these are great opportunities and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them if your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps it helps to be realistic read through the fine print understand the fees and penalties and decide whether they work for your lifestyle do you travel abroad extensively international financial transactions have never been easier or less laborintensive and while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and atm withdrawals others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers if you’re a frequent international traveler it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market  not only will this enable you to avoid the industrystandard  international surcharge but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since visa and mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks  you should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use nor foreign atm withdrawals is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking since the global financial crisis of  the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye but the banking industry is not a monolithic entity many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development fair lending and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs these institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible  they’re worth a look at the very least what does it mean to be fdic insured by john kiernan personal finance editor if your bank is fdic insured any money you put into a deposit account along with any earned interest will be returned to you even if your bank fails there are limits of course insurance coverage tops out at  per depositor per institution—not per account as some people assume that means if you have  in a money market account and another  in a cd at the same bank you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured it’s important to note that fdic insurance covers deposit accounts only that is checking savings cds and money market accounts other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide such as annuities life insurance and mutual funds including money market funds are not insured most banks and thrifts also known as savings and loan institutions are fdic insured but a few are not by law those that are must display the fdic logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials if you don’t see the logo or if you have any doubts ask about coverage credit unions are not covered by the fdic but they do have an insurance program of their own sponsored by the national credit union administration ncua  as is the case with banks this provides coverage for up to  per depositor per institution the fdic which stands for the federal deposit insurance corporation was founded by the us government in  in response to the widespread bank failures of the great depression fdic insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers commerce other banks and the overall economy and one of the hard lessons of the s and s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank even in the face of frightening economic and financial news in that way it protects not only the consumer but also the banks and the economy community discussion help others find the best banking

of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of now as part of this checkingsavings acc is a scam called save as you go that means that every time you make some electronic transaction like paying a bill usually    or more dollars depending on the amount of the transaction will be transferred from your checking part of the acc to the saving accthe idea is that you are to stupid to manage and save your own money so wells fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savingsas a result of this scam you can find yourself in a position where you have lets say  in your savings acc and  in your checking for a total of so lets assume you make a bill pay to your cable co of  that leaves a balance in your checking acc of  and your so

rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk you should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term if your accounts have not gone past  days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep or by sending along a goodwill letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late there are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts you should begin by puling your free annual credit report from httpswwwannualcreditreportcom so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts once you have a better picture of where you credit is now you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you i would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as lexington law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own you may wish to
