development program if this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus see use in

known to interact with nonliposomal vincristine sulfate simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included nonliposomal vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of phenytoin and to increase seizure activity cypa interactions vincristine sulfate the active agent in marqibo is a substrate for cytochrome p a isozymes cypa therefore the concomitant use of strong cypa inhibitors should be avoided eg ketoconazole itraconazole voriconazole posaconazole clarithromycin atazanavir indinavir nefazodone nelfinavir ritonavir saquinavir telithromycin similarly the concomitant use of strong cypa inducers should be avoided eg dexamethasone phenytoin carbamazepine rifampin rifabutin rifapentine phenobarbital st johns wort pglycoprotein interactions vincristine sulfate the active agent in marqibo is also a substrate for pglycoprotein pgp the effect of concomitant use of potent pgp inhibitors or inducers has not been investigated it is likely that these agents will alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of marqibo therefore the concomitant use of potent pgp inhibitors or inducers should be avoided use in specific populations pregnancy pregnancy category d see warnings and precautions based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies marqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women if this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus in an embryofetal developmental study pregnant rats were administered vincristine sulfate liposome injection intravenously during the period of organogenesis at vincristine sulfate doses of  to  mgkgday drugrelated adverse effects included fetal malformations skeletal and visceral decreases in fetal weights increased numbers of early resorptions and postimplantation losses and decreased maternal body weights malformations were observed at doses ≥  mgkgday in animals at systemic exposures approximately  of those reported in patients at the recommended dose nursing mothers it is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother pediatric use the safety and effectiveness of marqibo in pediatric patients have not been established geriatric use safety and effectiveness in elderly individuals have not been established in general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy renal impairment the influence of renal impairment on the safety efficacy and pharmacokinetics of marqibo has not been evaluated hepatic impairment nonliposomal vincristine sulfate is excreted primarily by the liver the influence of severe hepatic impairment on the safety and efficacy of marqibo has not been evaluated the pharmacokinetics of marqibo was evaluated in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction childpugh b secondary to melanoma liver metastases the doseadjusted maximum plasma concentration cmax and area under the concentrationtime curve auc of marqibo in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was comparable to the cmax and auc of patients with all who had otherwise normal hepatic function about beleodaqtm beleodaq is a panhdac inhibitor being studied in multiple clinical trials as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various hematological and solid cancers its anticancer effect is thought to be mediated through multiple mechanisms of action including the inhibition of cell proliferation induction of apoptosis
