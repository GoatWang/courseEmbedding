any such entity other than the depositor being hereinafter referred to as an enterprise and including appeals therein any such action or process being hereinafter referred to as a proceeding by reason of the fact that such person such persons testator or intestate i is or was a director or officer of the depositor or ii is or was serving at the request of the depositor as a director officer or in any other capacity or any other enterprise against any and all judgments amounts paid in settlement and expenses including attorneys fees actually and reasonably incurred as a result of or in

that such persons acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such person was not legally entitled in addition no indemnification will be made with respect to any proceeding initiated by any such person

asserted by such director officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
