facebook youtube twiter  got a question send an email june   by dave schwartz leave a comment how to divide and solve the big problem ray wallin brings the topic of problem solving to light hard problems don’t need to be hard to answer by using the simple approach of breaking complex problems into smaller ones you will find a solution share in handicapping every race that we encounter has a different level of complexity while we often try to focus on the “big picture” or the entire field this approach often leaves us scratching our heads as we try to figure out who are the contenders in  hungarian born mathematician george polya published a book that is still used today as part of college curriculums entitled how to solve it the basis of this book was to identify four basic principles of problem solving one of his principles was to devise a plan polya even went as far as to offer strategies on how to devise a plan one of which can be successfully applied to your daily approach to handicapping “solve a smaller simpler problem” some races are easier to analyze than others yet if you take a micro rather than macro scale approach to the more difficult races you will find your contenders with greater ease and confidence using polya’s principles the graphic above establishes that we have a “big problem” with several possible outcomes given the information that we have available we are unable to solve this problem however if we can identify smaller more manageable problems that we can solve the big problem will become easier to tackle sounds easy enough but how exactly can we apply this to handicapping horse races let’s start off assuming you are looking to pick the contenders within a given horse race as your big problem your small problems are the different factors you consider when handicapping while every handicapper weighs these factors different most look at all of them in each race in this graphic we have broken down the task of finding contenders into looking at the following factors – speed class form pace pedigree and the jockey and trainer there can be more or fewer small problems depending on your own style of handicapping or the conditions of the particular race the important thing is to pull the complexity out of the decision making process some handicapping factors will be easier to solve than others if you are looking at a conditioned claiming race you can see which horses have not met the condition and which horses have already beat the level or higher with relative ease you can tell which horses are from leading barns and have leading riders in the age of information most past performances will tell you how well both the jockey and trainer perform under today’s conditions maybe you are still stumped on how the pace of the race may set up if you still find that the smaller problem is too complex you can break these small problems down into even smaller problems you could look to identify the early speed horses and see how they match up with one another as well as the other entrants of the field if you have established that the early pace is weak you could analyze the pressing stalking or closing style horses to see which horse may have an advantage the key to this strategy is to continually break down the problem until you find a way to solve the small problems even if you need to continually break the smaller problem down several times each step becomes a simpler question to answer by drilling down this deep you gain confidence in your decisions and can start answering the bigger problems you don’t need to solve every small problem there will likely be some that you can’t solve at all you need to solve enough to be able to start eliminating possible outcomes this is the culmination of solving your smaller problems you have established a level of comfort and confidence in your solutions to this point by now some of the options are clearly either in play or can be completely eliminated whether it is a construction project your third grader’s math homework or a horse race applying george polya’s strategy of solving smaller simpler problems can help you make a molehill out of a mountain the resulting elimination of the least likely outcomes will help you find the solution to your problem with greater confidence read ray’s article monty hall by the numbers here about ray

thehorsehandicappingauthoritycom rss facebook youtube twiter  got a question send an email september   by dave schwartz leave a comment using monty hall to handicap monty hall by the numbers by ray wallin share i admit that i was at first a bit skeptical of the monty hall problem after all i consider myself a sound handicapper i know where my strengths and weakness lie i have been a winning horseplayer for years and while happy to be turning a profit i am always looking for a way to increase my potential number of plays and profit how could this monty hall analysis help my wagering dave schwartz’s quote in the original video was “concentrate twothirds of the winners into one–third of your contenders” first i took that challenge and tried an online monty hall simulator that tracks the results i did  trials why did i select   it was about the limit of my clicking the mouse without developing my carpel tunnel syndrome switching doors resulted in  winners or  staying with the original door resulted in  wins or  this falls in line with the expected results of  and  respectively the results may seem to counterintuitive at first when faced with three doors you have a  chance of being wrong with the door you initially select or conversely  chance of being right when monty reveals the “goat” behind one of the two remaining doors you have a  chance of being right on the switch at first it doesn’t sound like it can be possible how can switching the doors make that much difference many people would reason that there are two doors left and that is a  probability that you get the car or  that you get the goat when you think about it though it really is logical when you select the first door you have a  chance of being right meaning that there is a  chance that one of the two remaining doors is the winner that will not change once monty reveals the goat behind one of the two doors there is still a  chance that the winner is not the door originally selected so if the optimal monty hall should result in a  win rate why does the practical application on the actual races result in a lower percentage the difference is that when monty opens the door and shows you the goat this is new and perfect information there is no disputing that the goat is actually a goat in handicapping you can assign a probability to every horse in the field and even with throwing out noncontenders that information is not perfect the door that you are opening as your “goat” will carry a probability of winning as will the balance of the field that you have eliminated what factors to use dave is quick to point out several factors that he uses for this analysis but the key to making monty hall work is to avoid using factors that are interdependent why is this important perhaps you want to use speed figures and a pace figure published pace figures are often figured as a result of the speed in other words they consider many of the same factors what horse to select as your initial door since you are going to switch from your initial selection it would make the most sense to select the qualifying horse that you feel has the lowest probability of the three to win the race for example based on fair odds that you have assigned to qualifiers leaving you with three horses that you feel should be   and  this boils down to   and  by selecting the  horse as your initial choice you are then leaving yourself with the highest possible probability of the remaining contenders  deciding factor every horseplayer will probably approach the factors that get them to this point differently for some horseplayers it may be to use the higher odds horse of the two remaining as their “goat” depending on what factor or method that you used to get the field down to the three contenders you may elect to use class speed trainer or jockey information i had the pleasure of watching dave perform his analysis in real time over a webchat we could never expect the win rates to be approaching  yet he did manage to hit on five of the thirteen races we analyzed for  dave mentioned that he generally levels out at about  which is an excellent strike rate considering he can look at just about every race and apply his logic i am generally happy to have found one or two plays on an entire race card while  races is not enough of a sample size to confirm or deny anything i decided to give monty hall a try using my own set of criteria my results i decided to use the top three of my own pacebased speed rating pbr horses as my first handicapping object to get my three contenders the table below shows the recent performance of my pbr horses the winner has been amongst the top three selections in nonmaiden nontwo year old and nonturf races about  of the time the lowest rated of the three was my initial selection my deciding factor was to use the higher odds horse of the remaining two selections just before post time as my goat with a combined hit rate of  the perfect expectation would be s of that or  winners a  strike rate across all races is impressive especially since the top horse in the original sample of  races only hit   this included maiden twoyear old and turf races there are some of those races where i do have confidence in my selections which reduced that sample size down to  horses the win percentage and return improved those “confident races” resulted in a win rate of  amazingly close to that  expectation likewise if i take the full sample and pull out only the maiden twoyear old and turf races the sample improved win percentage and showed a profit of  on win bets taking only the confident races of this smaller grouping produced  plays or just over half of the sample in this case the win rate improved and the profit grew out of the  races used for the sample i wagered on  of them  this is a little higher than my normal amount of plays per card which has generally hovered around  if i had used the confident group of races from the nonmaiden two year old and turf group i would have played  races  or an extra race or two per card on average in the sample that dave shared with me he also had applied money management tactics in staggering the size of the wager based upon the amount of the eliminated pool my tables show a straight and equal wager on each horse in each race it begs to reason that you could further optimize your wagering and profits through practical money management techniques monty hall is a more powerful tool than i initially thought the key is to get the right handicapping objects based on either your own handicapping or the recommended objects if you use dave schwartz’s products in some cases the monty hall switch horse matched my wager and in some cases it did not i believe that anyone can incorporate monty hall into races where they are confident that do not warrant a wager using their normal criteria this will result in more playable races and less missed winning opportunities see

material contained in the webcast is the sole property and copyright of neophotonics with all rights reserved certain statements in this conference call which are not historical facts may be considered forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and include statements regarding future business results levels of sales and profitability subsequent events product and technology development customer demand inventory levels and economic and industry projections various factors could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risk factors have been set forth in our press release dated march   and are described at length in our annual and quarterly sec filings now i will turn the call over to ceo tim jenks timothy jenks thank you for joining us today  was a strong year for neophotonics with overall year over year revenue growth of  to  million and high speed product revenue growth of  year over year we had a strong finish to the year with our alltime record revenue in q at  million representing growth of  over the prior year period that said given the softness we are seeing in q i would like to begin my comments today with the recent developments that are impacting these estimates in december we announced the sale of our low speed transceiver product assets and provided an updated outlook on q at that time we were seeing a healthy forecast and backlog for the first quarter we also articulated some issues we were having with yield and supply chain on certain products and we reflected those issues in our revised fourth quarter guidance however since then we have seen meaningful changes in near term demand especially in recent weeks in china where we have major customers recall that china has been pursuing certain telecom national backbone deployments as it anticipates transitioning to increased metro and provincial deployments of g coherent networks in a subsequent deployment phase generally this is referred to as moving from socalled “phase ” to subsequent phases socalled “phase ” and beyond that said we are unaware of any large tenders for phases beyond phase  yet released so such deployments remain future anticipated events as a result we are right now at the tail end of phase  and before phases  or  etc recall also that a significant amount of our shipments are from vmi – that is from inventory that we may have already shipped but that we do not recognize as revenue until our customer pulls it for use and provides us notification in the last month or more we have seen declines in planned “pulls” from leading chinese customers and due to vmi we may realize this impact earlier and it is may be more pronounced than with those having limited vmi exposure the current demand level represents a delay relative to our customers’ beginning of quarter expectations about the timing of their ramp and transitioning from the current deployment to the next deployment phase and for which they had begun to build inventory this situation is similar to what we saw in the lull in the second half of  just before the socalled phase  deployments surged however our customers and our contacts within carriers in china tell us they anticipate significant growth in g ports in china in  relative to  albeit heavily loaded in the second half and extending into  as a result of these forecast changes we are providing an outlook for q with revenue that is well below our q results even after adjusting for low speed transceiver product sales as we closed the sale of those product lines on january  i will ask ray to provide details on our results for q and our outlook for q then i will return to provide more commentary on what we see going forward raymond wallin thank you tim and good afternoon sales for the fourth quarter totaled  million sales of our high speed products were  million or  of revenue and network products and solutions represented  million or  of revenue revenue excluding low speed transceiver products for the fourth quarter was  million a  increase from the prior year period and up  from the third quarter our overall nongaap gross margin was  down from  in the fourth quarter of  and up from  in the prior quarter total nongaap operating expense for the quarter was  million an increase of  versus the prior year period and up  sequentially nongaap operating income for the fourth quarter was  million or  of revenue flat with the prior year period but up  from the prior quarter nongaap net income in the fourth quarter was  million or  of revenue compared to  of revenue in the prior year period and  of revenue in the prior quarter based on a fully diluted share count of  million shares this translates to earnings per share of  for the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was  million or  of revenue for the full year of  revenue was  million a  increase from the prior year our full year nongaap gross margin was  and we delivered record nongaap net income of  million for the year nongaap eps was  cents per share and we achieved a record adjusted ebitda of  million or  of revenue i will close out my discussion of the fourth quarter income statement with a review of our gaap results fourth quarter gross margin was  flat with the prior year period and up  percentage points sequentially operating expense was  million or  versus the prior year period and down  compared to the third quarter of  operating income was  million for the fourth quarter which included approximately  million of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles  million of stockbased compensation expenses and  million of costs related to the sale of our low speed transceiver product assets net income was  million for the quarter up from net income of  million in the prior year period and up from a loss of  million in the prior quarter geographically our revenue mix for the fourth quarter was  in the americas compared to  in the third quarter china was  in the fourth quarter compared to  in the prior quarter japan was  compared to  in the prior quarter and the rest of the world was  compared to  in the prior quarter note that these figures are based on shipment destination not the end use destination we had two  or greater customers in the fourth quarter of  ciena comprised approximately  of our total revenue compared to  in the third quarter and huawei technologies comprised  of our total revenue compared to  in the third quarter a full reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap numbers for the quarter is included in our press release turning to the balance sheet we finished the year with  million in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash up from  million at september   restricted cash at december   was  million we generated  million in cash from operating activities a record level accounts receivable finished at  million with days sales outstanding at  days net inventory finished at  million with  days of inventory on hand capital expenditures were  million in the fourth quarter and full year capex was  million depreciation and amortization was  million before i discuss our revenue and earnings outlook for the first quarter of fiscal  i want to remind once again everyone of our public filings with the sec and our safe harbor statement included in our press release that discusses the risks and uncertainties that could affect future performance causing actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements in the first quarter there are principally four factors affecting our outlook first our low speed transceiver product lines are no longer included post close resulting in a quarter on quarter revenue reduction of approximately  million second as tim mentioned regarding the china market we are seeing delays relative to prior expectations about the timing of the next g deployment phase as a result our near term demand reflects a significant decrease in q as our customers adjust to these delays this decrease is exacerbated by available inventories at some customers the delay in china deployments is the largest part of our reduction in outlook third as we described in previous calls we are working through a lingering yield reduction in one of our fabs and we have some supply constraints in certain product lines caused by the rapid ramp of production volumes we are rapidly mitigating both of these issues but expect some residual impact on revenues in the first and also the second quarter these issues which affect all customers less than half that of the china demand reduction finally the first quarter is our seasonal low due to annual price reductions which this year are in a typical range and chinese new year holidays though the impact of these factors is lower than the others i have discussed now taking these factors into account the company’s expectations for the march  quarter are revenue in the range of  to  million nongaap gross margin in the range of  to  gaap diluted net loss per share in the range of  to  cents per share and nongaap diluted net loss per share in the range of  to  cents per share these numbers are reflective of approximately  million fully diluted shares our gaap outlook reflects the recognition of an anticipated gain on the sale of our low speed transceiver product assets of approximately  million or  cents per share for the next two quarters we will continue to support the manufacturing of the low speed transceiver products under a fixed price transition services agreement with the buyer and therefore we will continue to incur some of the variable manufacturing and operating costs associated with these products until they fully exit our factories finally in conjunction with our annual evaluation of our internal controls we determined that we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting specifically as it relates to the timing of revenue recognition there are no adjustments to reported financial information we are expanding our evaluation procedures related to revenue timing and have identified areas to enhance our internal controls i’ll now turn the call back to tim timothy jenks thank you ray the softness in our first quarter outlook directly reflects the views we have from customers on the quarter and their needs and while we are disappointed with the change in outlook over the last several weeks we feel confident this is simply a delay in the timing of deployments with demand returning once tenders are announced further we have several key new product introductions which will expand our market opportunity and position us to benefit from accelerating deployments both in the west and in china in  as i noted earlier we believe that demand for g and beyond products will be stronger in  than in  though later in calendar  we have been expanding capacity and investing in our new product developments and technology in line with this view now end market demand for our g and beyond products remained robust throughout  with china deployments kicking off a wave of growth beginning back in the fourth quarter of  followed by acceleration in metro and dci deployments that continued through the year and including a strong fourth quarter while our performance in  was good it was constrained by our capacity versus demand we believe actions taken during the year to expand production capacities reduce supply chain bottlenecks and increase manufacturing yields will set the stage for a more robust year in  that will result from anticipated tenders moving to deployment and again the timing anticipated here is q and beyond which we can well support in light of the production volumes we achieved in q as well as our ongoing yield improvements and capacity gains the mid and long term market drivers for our business remain compelling china remains committed through the china broadband  initiative to continue build out of the national backbone network and expanded buildouts of g provincial and metro networks our oem customers in china tell us they expect these actions to markedly increase the number of g ports in china in  over  but now with the preponderance of the deployments in the second half of the year in north america we continue to see strong demand with continued metro strength at verizon growing dci deployments and new announcements for att to begin initial g installations shifting to products and as noted in our recent press releases we have announced a number of exciting new products which will further help accelerate our growth and market leadership in  and beyond in the coherent module market we announced sampling of our coherent cfpdco module based on our clearlight™ coherent platform which is capable of achieving single wavelength  and  gbps transmission and joining our clearlighttm cfpaco solutions most recently we announced a new modulator product capable of higher order modulation at  gbaud in a micro form factor and with integrated drivers designed for use in cfp and smaller coherent module applications and providing data rates of g and faster we believe that the overall growth in ports the move to increasing g links plus our new module and modulator additions as well as strength in our component customers’ modules will continue to provide strength to our overall coherent share our new x multicast switch is designed for deployment in china as well as in the west and should begin to enter volume production in late  as a part of the next china deployment phase inside the datacenter we announced our low power consumption gbaud eml laser with integrated driver for client side g g pam and g pam applications we followedup with sampling our new long reach g cfp module based on our  gbaud eml lasers using pam transmission to reiterate we see the demand conditions of the first quarter as temporary and we expect to see a return to sequential growth with further acceleration later in the year through a combination of the next phase of deployments in china as well as new revenue streams from our new product introductions neophotonics will showcase and demonstrate many of our new product advancements at the optical fiber communication conference in los angeles california from march  to march  this concludes our formal comments and now i would like to ask the operator denise to open up the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from jorge rivas with craighallum capital group jorge rivas thanks for taking my question guys first i wanted to just get your take on what have you seen as far as like provincial – the provincial activity in china i understand the phase  is being delayed but we would expect this on – now such a decline since there were some provincial activity at the same time the carriers were having wavelengths who you already deploy equipment so can you update us on that front please timothy jenks yes sure there are a number of things going on but i think lets start with the expectation of moving from phase  to phase  and phase  we use those terms where the phase  that had a lot of deployment in the national backbone network and so the expectation is now to move to increasing provincial deployments and increasing metro but as we understand it and it depends by carrier but china mobile being the largest and then also china telecom and china unicom the expectation is that the next phase would be meaningful increases in the number of ports being deployed in the national backbone and then following that with increases in the provincial backbone now its important to note that in the national backbone deployment theres pretty good visibility carriers have good knowledge of that and they can tell you what and when in the provincial arena certainly large carrier like china mobile those numbers are actually done in the provinces so theres less central visibility to what the specific numbers will be but our customer forecasts due continue to show in the range of  to  increases  over  at the same time thats actually down a bit from what we knew in december so in december the numbers were higher than that and we also know that the timing of these things tend to follow peoples congress meeting so this year the peoples congress meeting started on march  tends to run for about two weeks and then several weeks after that is generally when the investment levels are announced and then tenders follow so that really has – the peoples congress has just happened and there have not yet been announcements on either the investment level or on the deployment timing however there were a number of things noted in news releases on the peoples congress where people had been talking about the level of investment – needed continued investment in the network and the strength of that and the commitment to that going forward does that answer your question jorge jorge rivas yes partially i just want to know if you saw any positive activity from the last call to now and into your guidance from provinces i understand its a decentralized process but theres about  provinces as far as we know so we were under the impression that they have more independence asked to build up with their own networks timothy jenks yes and thats true and so the specifics provincial deployments are ones where visibility we dont have forwardlooking visibility on that at the moment so i cant really tell you but i do know the total number of the estimated numbers of ports as i indicated are up in the range of – from about  ports last year to about  ports for example for the biggest customers jorge rivas okay and then one last question from me so i believe the yield issues had an impact of about  million last quarter any chance you can quantify that for the first quarter guide timothy jenks no really but its the same or a bit smaller its in that range jorge rivas okay all right thank you guys that’s all from me operator well take our next question from alex henderson with needham  company please go ahead alex henderson thanks so obviously with this extremely weak guide for the q the slope in for the full year is looking awfully challenged or is it the other alternative view would be that you just pending up demand into the back half given what youve said would you recommend investors and analysts think about lower numbers in the first half and maybe still maintaining the back half of the year or would you suggest that in fact we should be using a lower slope and a lower ramp off of much lower base and therefore a much lower number for each of the four quarters raymond wallin well lets see the – as i responded to the last question the timing for tenders matters a lot but typically what weve seen is decisions would follow the peoples congress by a few weeks so if that were following the normal pattern we would see such announcements that in the second quarter now what our customers have told us and this is from a couple of different customers is that they expect the balance of business to be kind of first half second half they expect it to be in the range of  or even  first half second half depending on the tender announcement time so i think the slope is steeper than we previously expected we also have seen some impact with existing inventory because customers were taking a higher volume of shipments in the fourth quarter in the first half of the first quarter and then really around the timing of early to mid february that slowed down appreciably and as a result i think were expecting that there maybe couple months of inventory available so they are very poised to ramp quickly with the inventory that they have for us that that matters because essentially with vmi weve already made the shipments but i think it is a steeper slope for the year probably lower than previously thought but a steeper slope alex henderson can you tell us what the percentage of sales in q that was  gig and what you think in the guide percent of march quarter would look like at  gig raymond wallin okay so the answer is in the fourth quarter alex the number was  but in the fourth quarter that  included our low speed transceiver asset revenues and so in the first quarter that transaction closed on january  so we will only have revenue for those products until the january  so ultimately i think we will be in the  to  range in the first quarter because we have to make that adjustment for those departed low speed products alex henderson another question if i could as im looking at the gross margins in the quarter as well as the guide for the march quarter i understand that the yield issues are impacting revenues by  million but what is it impacting the margins raymond wallin well our guidance guiding from  to  is about one to two margin points lower than it would have been if we didnt have the lower forecast so the fact that we have – its much less about lower yield its much more about the lower output so with the midpoint of guidance its  the dominant factor is just the volume alex henderson okay as we look at the new products that youve been launching is there a timeline for when those could materially impact the topline and contribute to growth raymond wallin well sure couple of different things the products that we actually announced last year and designed in for example into a number of different modules dco and aco certainly the dco products would have a meaningful impact as the provincial networks ramp in china other products we mentioned in particular the multicast switch thats really a second half event so we are shipping multicast switch in north america but i referred specifically to our  configuration that is designed specifically with the china network in mind so that would really expect to start in the third quarter and ramp pretty heavily by the fourth quarter so all of the products that i spoke to can contribute to second half revenue now the newest one the one that i said most recently announced is our new modulator  gigabaud modulator that product i would not expect to have significant revenue in  i would expect that to be ramping late in the year so contributing in  alex henderson okay if i could ask two more questions do you think it’s because of the late timing in  on china ramp that causes a fairly solid splash into the first half of  and that we continued growth in  or do you think that this is kind of a onetime pop in the back half of the year and then we rolloff and then second do you think your margins as we get through all the yield issues and get the production ramp going and volumes up to speed will get up into the mid s or do you think were stuck in this lower  range timothy jenks so on the first part of the question alex the – again the vernacular difference is slightly by carrier but referring to the largest in china mobile let me refer to both of phase  and phase  where phase  is generally referring to increasing volumes going into the national backbone and thats decidedly a  event and if tenders are announced in april that ramping can actually be pretty significant by the third quarter and then phase  which is really much more about the provincial networks that one continues to roll into  for sure that would be an extension on prior awards and that would continue to grow in  now with respect to margins in selling our low speed products as we talked about on the last call we expected that to contribute to one or two margin point increase in overall margin and we do expect that as our volume goes back to the level that it was and say the fourth quarter than we would expect margins to tick up by a couple of percentage points so whether or not it gets to the mid s i think it will go couple points above where it is right now alex henderson thanks raymond wallin hey alex ray here so if we kind of wrap all the absorption and yield problems together were probably talking somewhere two to four points of margin relative to our guidance alex henderson okay thank you operator our next question comes from troy jensen with piper jaffray please go ahead troy jensen hi there thanks for taking my question tim and ray i guess maybe along when question here but can you talk about where are the inventory problems specifically had a broadbased kind of very focused in addition to that weve heard that huawei is shifting from using a discrete component architecture to make the line cards to using pluggable modules i am just curious if you guys have lost share maybe in the new designs with pluggables are lower timothy jenks yes okay so generally speaking the national backbone is using a preponderance of line cards and the provincial will increase the use of pluggables certainly we have shipped – were selling into the pluggable modules quite a bit both with – well certainly our largest customer huawei is an important module customer and merchant module suppliers as well and so what we see as we see significant increases in shipments really in the fourth quarter and first quarter that really go to those modules that said we believe that there has not been a huge amount of shipment of those modules from the oems so this is in fact part of the revenue out that weve given troy in that we had a fair amount of shipment in the fourth quarter and then going through the first half of the first quarter for the modules in particular for dco modules these are a couple of different products and then as tenders have not been announced we have seen the customers put on the brakes and then we believe that they are still holding significant amount of inventory for those modules in stock and so when the tenders are announced we would expect that to open up but until theyre announced we would expect it to be a little bit slow and that is for reason so we dont see it – we see it theres a bit of a mix change because the products that we sell on line cards and the products we sell in modules are in fact different products and different versions of lasers different versions of receivers et cetera but we know exactly what the volumes are and we know what the mix difference is so in that sense i think broadly speaking with respect to share over the current time period weve seen increases in some products such as lasers exceed the rate of growth of ports in the industry and receivers we had very strong share and there are some cases where weve gone for example from a sole supplier into one of two and there has been some modest share loss as the volumes have continued to either be flat or up but overall netnet incoherent components we think we’re actually either constant or gaining slightly in share overall troy jensen all right and just one other question for me obviously the multicast switch opportunity in china is going to get pushed out with this so assume but can you just talked about where you are with verizon in the multicast opportunity timothy jenks so with verizon – verizon is deploying socalled cdc networks or around the select networks that use multicast switches and were continuing to ship in the verizon they have two principal suppliers of these products were really tied into the cisco supply chain here and i think were major supplier with strong demand going into that that deployment we would see as the deployments in china start using the similar architecture for example in the china mobile network which we understand decision has been made that we understand that china telecom is still considering it but these are these would be important offers to the overall tam that were serving and the size of that business going forward troy jensen all right understood how about – maybe just a last one for ray can you help us out with the tax rate and then other income that we should be thinking about this year raymond wallin this is based on what we know today and were looking at about a  tax rate for the company overall for  troy jensen okay thank you good luck guys raymond wallin thanks troy operator we’ll take our next question from paul silverstein with cowen and company unidentified analyst hi this is indiscernible for paul a couple of questions on the new metro rfb should we be assuming that you already qualified for those new pluggable modules or do you have to go through a cycle of qualification once those rfb were issued in your oem customers know what they’ll be shipping in timothy jenks are you referring to pluggable modules in china unidentified analyst yes somewhere you had mentioned that the phase  opportunity is mostly going to be a pluggable module so timothy jenks so actually i think i said that phase  would be principally line cards going into backbone in phase  but increase the amount of the pluggable modules that go into provincial networks and thats not a black and white statement but the deployments that our national backbone have majority line cards okay we sell into both we sell actually pretty strongly into both with receivers and lasers and so we have been shipping since the fourth quarter into the module builds and we have seen a slowdown of that in the first quarter we understand that to be inventory related but we are continuing to sell both into the modules and the line cards and so it is not a future design win that were waiting for we are actually designed and we are a significant supplier and as the volume happens we enjoy that business unidentified analyst got it one more question if i may you also cited pricing pressure or pricing resets how much of pricing was a factor in your guidance as well timothy jenks well pricing the typical range of pricing is usually in the  to  range i think were in the low end of that this year but its in that neighborhood unidentified analyst okay and lastly if i could inventory build how many months are we talking about raymond wallin i think the answer has to be in the range of one to three months they certainly – i dont think they have a quarters worth but they have more than a month so its in that range and it depends by customer also generally im referring to really our largest customers unidentified analyst got it thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from tim savageaux with northland capital markets tim savageaux hi good afternoon timothy jenks hi tim tim savageaux mostly some followup questions on what we’ve been discussing thus far first on the magnitude of the q shortfall relative to say where you were in q or you may have been expected to be in q so obviously we have to account for the low speed transceiver the traction of that business and so of that remaining delta kind of putting everything together that you mentioned in terms of the four factors in my close and saying its about  kind of china issues and  yield and seasonality if you will or and i anticipate that you had pretty good visibility to whatever yield in the seasonality or pricing issues that you may have seen through the quarter as opposed to a more recent and unexpected development on the china front is that a fair way to look at it as well timothy jenks as i think ray indicated the biggest impact here has been the relatively nearterm decline in the china numbers so yes we had good knowledge of the impact obviously of the sales of low speed transceivers and weve good knowledge of the pricing weve made a lot of progress on the yield and supply chain but theres still work to do but the largest impact is china and thats relatively recent and again thats also related to vmi in other words to very extent that that product has been shipped in vmi but we have reasonable understanding from our customers what they expect to take in the quarter it is relatively late in the quarter and i hope that – does that address your question tim savageaux i think so yes and then on the module versus discrete front i wondered if you can sort of discuss your decision to launch the dco module kind of at all in the context of – sensibly youre selling into both internally produced dco modules at the likes of the huawei or also thirdparty or merchant dcos with your own platform here i guess kind of pursuing the same strategy with aco i wonder if you can discuss the dynamics of being in the module business yourself versus selling components into modules the impacts on topline and whether that does indeed impact your relative share on the components side which is youre likely to have higher content in your own stuff in thirdparty stuff or internally manufactured module and would that be the… timothy jenks we actually look at elements that are related to customers elements that are related to markets and elements that are related to performance we tend to pursue those applications that are at the highest speed in the longest distance and our components reflect higher performance we have the highest bandwidth receivers we’ve announced  gigabaud modulator we have announced the – we have ultranarrow linewidth tunable lasers and so ultimately our products are very well suited for the longer reaches and for the highest data rates this is sometimes serving different customers than existing suppliers and different markets so in china it’s often different customers than internal production of dcos and in the west its often different market so less so in the telecom space and more so in the dci space so we view this as extending our technology and reach into those applications that need the highest data rates and longest reaches tim savageaux okay i wanted to followup on that quickly and you could still deliver those component level advantages and other guys modules i guess what i was trying to get to was these sort of business rational or being in the module market yourself versus trying to go bestinclass in sockets… raymond wallin well by going bestinclass also then you can be selling all of the components instead of one of the component so that also matters tim savageaux right exactly in some sense i mean the move to modules in general for a more component focus supplier is a bit of a headwind and i think youre trying to address that for your own module introductions on both dco and aco raymond wallin thats correct and dco and aco particularly in the longer reach and higher performance and ultimately we see this across the entire industry essentially the market size expands with those new applications and we also see that well be selling modules on a continuous basis as you know some of the certain chinese customers actually will be supplying their own modules and as a result we are supplying them with the components tim savageaux right understood okay final question for me it has to do with the kind of sloop and growth and baseline type discussion before but if you look at i think tell me if this is correct appropriately look at the baseline organically as your topline minus the low speed transceiver business something in the range of  million i would start – i think you’d indicated previously that  would be a stronger year than  even factoring in that headwind obviously with the q guide i wouldnt expect that to be the case but if you want to pick your milestone do you think the company can grow or stay flat with the previous years revenue given the both exit from access or low speed transceivers or to what extent do you think youll see growth off of that  raymond wallin i think the answer to that tim is really born in the whole discussion about what happens in china we have expectations from customers where as i indicated it might be onethird and twothird first half versus second half and i should note that we did  million in  included in that was low speed revenues which was  million and so the products continuing and the company would have revenue in  they generated a contribution of  million of revenue in  and so essentially the question youre asking is do we expect that well have growth on that product set of  or more really and i think that is really answered by the timing of the chinese tenders and the magnitude of the chinese tenders because that matters to our overall outlook pretty significantly we see in the first quarter that our guidance is – our outlook is soft because of the fact that those tenders havent happened yet by the same token i would expect that – if the tenders come out as expected or anticipated then i would expect a meaningful rebound so those are the variables that we see tim savageaux got it thanks operator and we will take a followup question from alex henderson from needham  company please go ahead alex henderson yes just along the same lines so that  million can you just play that across the four quarters just so that everybody has the same baseline and why you are thinking about that the other question was can you give us some sense of what your capex numbers are in the fourth quarter and what do you expected to be as we go over the course of the year timothy jenks yes so the capex i think in ray’s comments he said that the capex was total of  million and for  and then for  we would expect a lower number but in the  to  range for quarter ray do you want to talk about that raymond wallin yes i think youre probably looking at for  right now on  million to  million range for capex it was  million in  and it was  million in the fourth quarter of  timothy jenks okay and then your first question was how can we spread the  million and the answer is it was about  million in the first quarter followed by  million followed by  million followed by  million now those you would say add up to  million but well just rounding here it’s approximately… alex henderson and can you talk a little bit about the opex level that you’re expecting in q a little bit about display are you expecting rd to step up does ga in sales and marketing change at all as a result of the divestiture can you give us some of the benchmarks around those ray raymond wallin sure for the march quarter on a nongaap basis total operating expenses are being guided to about  million to  million and so i think that would be – i think it relative to the exit of the low speed transceiver assets but don’t see much change as a result of that because we continuing to operate it timothy jenks i really for two quarters raymond wallin for two quarters so were keeping the expenses there so if you kind of look at the q we were  opex and we –  opex and then when we get into  its going to be higher because of the lower revenue but the dollars are as i said alex henderson right so is that  million or so in the rd line is that what i should be thinking raymond wallin let me take a quick look at this yes it could be right around  million to  millionish alex henderson so conceptually as were looking at producing a pretty solid loss here in the first quarter are you planning on taking some actions to straighten the ship out and get the profitability back up to towards doubledigits at some point or how long – whats the shape of the business model as we think about your objectives in terms of operating income timothy jenks yes so there are two things to think about there alex the first one is that as noted the big dependency here is chinese tenders and the decrease in the topline is not a decrease in production its a decrease in recognized revenue because of shipments into vmi and so – and then the second thing is the manufacturing the low speed transceiver products which takes six months so there wont be meaningful decreases until those products that exit our plan which is in six months alex henderson im a little confused by that wouldnt that show up in the cost of goods sold line not in the opex line now timothy jenks mostly yes mostly yes but not entirely theres some sga and theres some rd thats just a small bit residual which is assisting with it but for the most part it is in costs of goods sold but essentially we do view it as temporary in terms of the impact on revenue and so we would expect that i think you should expect that a normalized number in our income statement would be in place by the third quarter it may not be in place by the second quarter because of the timing and the various things that weve just been talking about alex henderson okay and i think i followup that answer so is it your thought that some point in the next couple three four quarters that youll be back in a  or is it going to a struggle to achieve doubledigits raymond wallin yes i think alex as we look at it today is very possible that we would be back there in the second half of  were looking at these events as relatively temporary and therefore dont see a need to adjust expenses that much to compensate for it timothy jenks i think the real question though is the timing of the tenders raymond wallin yes timothy jenks the timing of the tenders and you have the volume thats one scenario if you dont have the tenders in the volume you have another scenario raymond wallin you have another scenario timothy jenks so the baseline is that we have the tenders we have the volume but in all cases i think you should expect us to be there in the second half alex henderson just to round out the longer term question are you still thinking  is – china is a  plus growth volume year or you thinking that thats a lower number or something different raymond wallin in  i have to say on the fact that were providing the guidance for the first quarter that were providing in the fact that we dont have the phase  and phase ’s announced yet my crystal ball on  is a little bit foggy alex henderson yes i understand but you do talk about the program raymond wallin yes based on the forecast that we have from carriers there is continuing growth in the number of port deployments that are planned and so whether that is close to  or over  its certainly approaching that range so were optimistic but that remains to be seen in what the government announces and what the carriers announce now it is notable that in one of the opening speeches in the peoples congress discussion was that there were comments made about  having underfunded telecom investment in china so this is government comments and opening speeches so with comments related to underfunding there is a motivation to do more to catch up to make sure that they deliver to their plans so that gives us a cautious level of optimism but again we have to see with the tenders alex henderson very helpful thank you operator our next question it comes from dave kang with b riley david kang thank you good afternoon just a clarification on the huawei first i thought you said huawei was  customer was it for fourth quarter or for the year raymond wallin that was for the fourth quarter david kang got it okay and then just wanted to also clarify on your gross margin comments so what is your normalized gross margin say  million to  million per quarter without the yield issue and post upon divestiture raymond wallin dave ray here so it would be  to  following the sale however if you normalize for these yield and other issues as we said previously its two to four points of impact from that so just to aggregate those two david kang got it and then i thought you talked about something of a supplier issue can you elaborate what that is timothy jenks well we have two things that we talked about it in december but the first thing is we had some yield impact in one fab that if that continues into the first quarter in the december call i talked about the fact that the throughput time and fabs can be multiple months and so corrective actions take time to play out we are seeing our yield curves normalize and so we do know that there have been meaningful improvements in yields the other thing is that we have significantly ramped certain products and that has put some constraints on component purchases that we do so when we significantly ramp a product weve managed to strain some of our component supplier which is slowing our rate of growth for those products i think that’s basically working though the system really started in the fourth quarter going on in the first quarter that’s working through the system right now and generally speaking these impact a narrow range of products and principally laser products and laser products or something with the increasing ports and the increasing applications from the fact that we were supplying into longhaul longhaul then goes to three or four extra volume when you move to metro add on top of that the dci add on top of that the deployments in china that the demand overall for lasers of various types has been very very strong and so that does – that has put a little bit of constraint on some suppliers david kang okay and just to be clear as it sounds like the yield issue is at the first quarter the second quarter issue to be behind the company correct timothy jenks well i talked about it in the fourth quarter so its a fourth quarter and first quarter issue… david kang right right but the second quarter i mean it shouldn’t be an issue in the second quarter timothy jenks there maybe some residual in the second quarter but its not material over time david kang okay got it and then just a couple more i guess i want to ask about phase  tenders too so in the previous call you talked about maybe the gap between tenders and the ramp is about one to two quarters what do you think right now is it more like one quarter or maybe two quarters timothy jenks so i dont have any better information now than i had then on terms of the timing because – two parts of it so what i said last time if we go back to  it was four to five months after announcing the tenders that you see significant production volumes as a result of those tenders that resulted in tenders announced in the second quarter of  with quite a surge beginning in the fourth quarter of  so thats our relevant example now i think at this point in time based on where we sit and what we see we see more available inventory right now that we saw then so that lends itself to a shorter time being possible but we sell a few products were not the entire supply chain were not the entire system but just from where we sit there is the possibility of a compressed timeframe but i dont know that to be in the plan from the oems or the carriers david kang got it thank you operator our next question comes from richard shannon with craighallum timothy jenks hi richard richard shannon hi tim and ray thanks for taking my questions i jumped on the call rather late so indiscernible been on for about  minutes so i might ask you questions that youve been covered already but maybe just two from me first of all it sounds like youve had in terms of your first quarter guidance vmi with some of your larger customers has been an impact here and sounds like a lot of its coming from china anyway that you could give us a sense of how much you expect from huawei or from china coming the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter timothy jenks so on a percentage basis certainly we – ray talked about the fact that in the fourth quarter we had very very strong demand from huawei huawei was  of total shipments in the fourth quarter and given what ive talked about inventory and slowdowns and delays we do not expect to repeat of that performance and essentially as the drop is mostly in china and china is mostly with the few customers we would expect their respective percentages to be lower for us when we think about china i tend to think about four customers in particular huawei fiberhome zte and alcatel shanghai build part of nokia and in the current situation we see the highest vendor managed inventory levels are really related to the first two and so to an extent those are the biggest impacts richard shannon okay timothy jenks just to hit it on on your question no question that huawei to this impact because huawei is having the revenue richard shannon right okay and maybe tim i’ll ask a question maybe in a different way which is you look at your first quarter revenues here how would you characterize your gross either sequentially or maybe yearonyear or maybe is a better number to look at excluding china timothy jenks well i think for the overall year we see the nonchina business is running very much on plan its only the china business that has a lower impact on the first quarter now the seasonality that we see every year we do see seasonality the seasonality is not just a china impact because of price negotiations in the fourth quarter and the fact that the production cycle in the first quarter is for us where we have a week quarter because of china new year celebration if you will that factory shutdown for a week those things are normal but essentially our other customers are generally unplanned and a little impact really no impact on can richard shannon okay i’ll take all of my – rest of my questions offline thanks for the time guys timothy jenks you’re welcome end of qa operator it appears there are no further questions at this time mr tim jenks i’d like to turn the conference over to you for any additional or closing

recap nfl betting stop reinventing the wheel we all live busy lives and have day jobs and families that need our attention  if being a licensed engineer has taught me one thing it is that having and knowing how to use the right references will save you a ton of time it was a warm spring day back in  when i took my professional engineer’s exam  i arrived at the testing location early and started to unpack my references  i loaded three crates of reference manuals and binders of notes onto a borrowed hand truck to make my way into the testing center  since i was taking the transportation module in the afternoon not only did i have the most books of anyone that i sat near i also seemed to have the largest books as well  there was no way that anyone could have ever remembered the equation and all the adjustment factors for calculating free flow speed on a four lane highway  this is when knowing how and when to use your references comes in handy so what types of references can save you time and brain cells when handicapping sire data just like i couldn’t tell you the adjustment factor for a right shoulder lateral clearance of four feet without looking it up i also can’t tell you how well first time starters out of archipenko perform without looking it up  brisnet’s sire stats is reasonably priced at   i used brisnet’s product for a couple of years before switching over to progressive handicapping’s sire ratings    both publications show the performance of the sire’s offspring over turf off tracks synthetic surfaces and with firsttime starters  though noted differently both publications have a factor or grade for class of the offspring and what distances the sire’s offspring should excel at also available for  per year is a report for each race card showing the sire data so you don’t need to look it up  progressive handicapping takes it one step further with their debut sire guide  which provides even more detail about  sires with another  sires available via an online appendix  provided stats in this book are broken down by distance surface trainer class state bred two year olds off tracks and by owner trainer data most past performances show some trainer statistics yet progressive handicapping again takes this a step further  two of their publications turf trainer guide and debut trainer guide are invaluable resources to me  much like their debut sire guide extra detail is paid to  trainers in each publication  each  statistics include wins by distance surface classification twoyearolds owners jockeys and by odds tracktotrack comparisons making your own pars is an exhaustive and ongoing project  how much is your time actually worth  i used to use the simplest comparisons i could find the american turf monthly track equalization chart  this was easy to use yet was lacking turf ratings and lumped all distances into sprints miles and routes still for free product it was ok i got my hands on a copy of pars plus from cynthia publishing  a few years back and immediately stopped using the equalization chart  these pars were broken down by track distance and class but i have recently found par data that left me feeling like a little kid coming down the stairs on christmas morning  dave schwartz’s horsestreet par times blew my mind   the data is broken down several different ways depending on how you want to use it  adjustments are provided for female races state breads by age month of birth and different levels within the claiming ranks nonwinners of two nonwinners of three etc  dave also provides a “sri” or a speed reliability index for each track which gauges how consistent that track runs  meet data once again progressive handicapping hits this one of the park with their handicapper and blue chip trainer angles publications for specific meets  the book covers running style and jockey statistics but also details the key trainers of the meet  i have purchased this product for several years for monmouth park and have downloaded a free copy of both publications for woodbine  the blue chip trainer angles highlights only profitable high percentage and consistent trainer angles obviousyi have not touched on all the available products in the categories above  i have found that progressive handicapping’s products help to complement my handicapping style  they may not be for everyone but i have found that jim mazur has been a pleasure to deal with in many email exchanges over the last few years since i first saw him do a race card analysis at monmouth park many years ago  i would love to hear what other products that any of you use  i am always willing to try something new no need to kill yourself trying to remember it all  your time is valuable and while you could produce any of the products above you have to think about how much your time is actually worth   is a few hundred dollars a year worth not trying to collect daily data process it and run reports   that is time that could be better spent by handicapping ray wallin ray wallin is a licensed civil engineer and parttime handicapper who has had a presence on the web since  for various sports and horse racing websites and
