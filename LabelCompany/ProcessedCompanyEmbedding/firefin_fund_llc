industry artisan makers are disrupting the food and drink market by focusing on variety and smaller batches  specialty foods seized over b in sales in   craft beer continues double digit growth as the overall beer market contracts equity crowdfunding will disrupt financing  state and federal regulations are changing such that small businesses will soon have access to a much greater pool of capital through the sale of equity online the potential to sell equity to customers will disrupt and democratize the traditional finance model the perfect pairing  as an alternative source of capital equity crowdfunding will help craft food and drink makers gain more market share  additionally equity crowdfunding is a grassroots source of capital that is more consistent with these craft brands read more investment vs rewards crowdfunding investment vs rewards crowdfunding rewards crowdfunding  the rewards crowdfunding model popularized by sites such as kickstarter is the process of sourcing capital online from a larger group of individual contributors  the contributions are best understood as donations in exchange for a donation individuals receive “rewards” such as a sample product or gear equity crowdfunding equity crowdfunding is the process of sourcing capital by selling equity online to a larger group of investors  previously companies were only permitted to sell shares to the very wealthy  because of recent regulatory changes small businesses will be able for the first time to sell shares directly to the general public  therefore an investor receives a stake in the company as opposed to a tshirt turning customers and local residents into owners and advocates we believe investment crowdfunding is the future for food drink and place makers startups will have access to more seed capital  existing companies will have an opportunity to grow in a more grassroots manner by turning customers and local community into owners and advocates read more how it works the process states faq about the numbers a disruption based out of the brew city join our disruptive mission  craftfund story the craftfund story is firmly rooted in the brew citymilwaukee wisconsin the story began with two good friends sharing a beer and discussing our passion for craft beer and the city of milwaukee we discussed our love for how craft beer disrupts the status quo as well as our passion for seeing our local place thrive we also discussed visiting new places discovering local makers and experiencing others passion for where they live it became clear that what we wanted was the ability to take ownership of our local places around the same time we were having these conversations a grassroots campaign to purchase one of milwaukees storied breweriespabst brewing cowas underway the attempt was wildly successful receiving over  million in pledges from over  million potential investors unfortunately the campaign technically violated securities laws and was shut down by the sec we then realized we were part of a broader consumer demand for ownership experiences in craft makers this demand went unmet due to decades old laws that precluded general public from investing in local companies so we set out to create a solution using his legal and regulatory background david dupee worked with the wisconsin legislature to adopt one of the first state equity crowdfunding laws and the first to be passed through the legislative process  wisconsin is now at the forefront of a growing movement to democratize capital by allowing residents to invest in small businesses online as a result consumer demand for ownership experiences will finally be met  in addition local food and place makers have access to a new source of capital that is more consistent with their brand and projects craftfund is therefore the next chapter in a beautiful story about customers and community members turned owners and advocates our mission is to provide local residents with a platform to craft better communities through investments in food drink and place makers join the movement to democratize capital own craft own your place read more craftfund team david dupee craft beer enthuisiast  founder read his latest blog post  craftfund team the craftfund team craftfund was founded by a passionate attorney who has advocated for new laws and is advised by individuals with significant finance and industry background learn more about the craftfund team read more intrastate crowdfunding advancing industry growth by turning local customers into owners join our growing community  intrastate crowdfunding how we got here raising capital is a highly regulated exercise  the general rule is that to raise capital by selling equity a company must first register the offering with federal and state governments unless it is able to meet a federal exemption traditionally and generally speaking the exemptions have only applied when selling to high net worth individuals called “accredited investors” this appeared set to change when congress passed the jobs act in  which created an exemption to allow companies to sell smaller amounts of equity online to the general public nationwide so long as certain conditions however the jobs act has still not gone into effect due to prolonged rulemaking  what it is frustrated with pace of jobs act implementation states have begun to proactively create their own solutions  pursuant to the federal intrastate exemption several states have passed or are considering state investment crowdfunding laws to make it easier for state business to sell equity to state residents wisconsin example wisconsin was the third state to create an intrastate crowdfunding law and first to do so through the legislative process  craftfund was very involved in getting the law passed which will go into effect june    below is a high level overview of  wisconsin assembly bill  wisconsin companies that generate at least  of their business from operations in wisconsin can raise up to m no audit or m audit from wisconsin residents every  months every wisconsin resident may invest up to  in a wisconsin company wisconsin residents making at least  per year may invest an unlimited amount wisconsin companies must limit the offer and sale of equity to wisconsin residents companies wishing to advertise the offering must conduct the raise through an internet portal registered with the department of financial institutions companies must provide department of financial institution and investors with a required disclosure document funds held in escrow with wisconsin bank until target amount is hit or exceeded companies with successful raises required to deliver quarterly reports to shareholders   read more craftfund story october   tags crowdfunding jobs act title iii craft beer crowdcube latest blog wisconsin offers preview of equity crowdfunding under jobs act craftfund was formed to help food and beverage companies raise capital from passionate customers and local residents  it’s based on the deepseated conviction that the opportunity to invest should depend on how much one knows about the company not how much money one makes from the outset this has required changes in securities laws to allow for democratization of investing therefore we are excited that the sec is poised on friday to release final rules that will read full blog tweets faq what is craftfund craftfund is an online platform that allows local residents to craft the future of their communities through investments in food drink and place makers what types of companies can use craftfund craftfund is a platform for place makers just as we enjoy exploring new places and local products so too would we like to see an online market for placebased investments a platform where you can go to learn more about productsprojects in your area as well as invest in companies that might need funding we believe this new funding model will work best with products and businesses that people are familiar with and are passionate about right now we are only open to foodbeverage companies and real estate developers how does it work food and beverage companies can create a profile to advertise local products real estate developers can create a profile to highlight certain projects companies in need of capital can seek investments from local customers only in wi right now customers can browse company profiles to learn more about local food products and real estate projects customers can do due diligence on and invest in these companies raising capital on the site only wi residents right now how is craftfund different from kickstarter craftfund is an equity platform this means that instead of donating to companies investors on this site purchase shares or investment interests in the companies in short every deal on this site turns customers into actual owners of the companies they are passionate about what types of securities can companies offer on craftfund food and beverage companies will offer equity a percentage of the company to investors real estate developers will have the option to offer equity or debt what is the difference between equity and debt simply put an investor in an equity deal becomes a part owner of the company the actual percent ownership is determined by dividing the investment amount by the companys valuation what the company determines it is worth in a debt deal the investor does not become an owner in the company instead the investment functions as a loan that the company agrees to pay back in addition to interest accrued why are offerings only allowed in wisconsin the offerings presented on craftfund are possible under the intrastate exemption to federal securities laws wi is one the first states to create a state crowdfunding law under this intrastate exemption we will explore additional markets as laws change how are investor funds held craftfund does not hold investor funds instead state law requires that companies enter into an escrow agreement with a bank located chartered under wisconsin law all investments are in the form of a check that gets deposited into an escrow account with a wisconsin bank serving as escrow agent investors mail a check directly to the wisconsin bank what happens if the company does not hit its target investors have the right to cancel a commitment to invest and have funds returned by escrow agent if the company does not reach its minimum target however the investor can also choose to proceed with the investment craftfund will follow up with each investor to determine how they wish to proceed what about the jobs act the president signed the federal jobs act in april of  once implemented by the sec the jobs act will allow companies to sell equity online to the general public nationwide through funding portals andor broker dealers there are concerns over whether the jobs act will be cost prohibitive for small companies regardless we are closely monitoring regulatory developments how much can i invest in a company any wi resident can invest up to  in a wisconsin company wi residents with at least  income or  net worth can invest an unlimited amount who can invest in companies on craftfund only residents of the state where the offering company is located may invest in deals right now the platform is limited to wi companies therefore only wi residents may invest in wi companies   are these investments risky yes investing in privateand or early stage companies is always risky you could lose all of your money read our investor  for more details who is responsible for conducting due diligence investors craftfund’s initial due diligence is limited to checking for any bad actors associated with the company the fact a company is listed on our site simply means that our reasonable investigation has not turned up any such bad actors it should not be taken as a recommendation or endorsement instead our investor community is responsible for performing its own due diligence on attractiveness of each deal we believe members of local community are in best position to evaluate these companies what will i get in return for my investment this will depend on the terms of each investment ownership interests in private companies can entitle investors to dividends also companies may choose to provide discounts or other shareholder perks ultimately every investment allows an investor to become an actual stake holder in local companies they are passionate about can i sell shares purchased on craftfund shares purchased on this site cannot be resold for a certain period of time often  months except under very limited circumstances regardless investments in private companies are often illiquid meaning investors should be prepared to hold the investment indefinitely how do i know if my company is a wi company your company must be organized and do substantial business in the state that you seek to seek capital from the general rule of thumb for proving substantial business in a state is that a company derives at least  of its business from the state how much does it cost to raise funds on craftfund it is free to sign up and invest in companies it is also free to create a company profile wisconsin companies raising funds will be charged a due diligence and listing fee we do not take a backend success fee my company is not in wi can i raise funds on the site right now only wi companies may raise funds on the site however we expect expand as more states adopt crowdfunding laws andor federal jobs act develops my company is not in wi can we create a product profile yes any us food and drink company can create a free basic profile basic profiles are limited to general brand and product description and cannot include any solicitation or offers craftfund reserves the right to remove any content that goes beyond brand and product description what are the benefits of equity crowdfunding equity crowdfunding is a desperately needed new source of capital for small businesses additionally equity crowdfunding is an innovative way for companies to connect with and engage customers can my company offer shareholder perks yes companies are encouraged to create ownership experiences for investors are there any reporting requirements yes state laws require companies to provide a quarterly report to investors do you help with shareholder relations post investment yes our shareholder portal is a mechanism for companies to deliver required reports and engagecommunicate investors the numbers craft beer and crowdfunding are two nascent and trending industries for the past several years the craft beer market
