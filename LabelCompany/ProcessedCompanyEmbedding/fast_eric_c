excerpt fast food nation  food inc  pov  pbs food inc a robert kenner film pbs premiere april  check the broadcast schedule » excerpt fast food nation why the fries taste goodthe mistake of standing alonefood product designmillions and millions of friesfood product designfood product designthe taste of mcdonalds french fries has long been praised by customers competitors and even food critics james beard loved mcdonalds fries their distinctive taste does not stem from the type of potatoes that mcdonalds buys the technology that processes them or the restaurant equipment that fries them other chains buy their french fries from the same large processing companies use russet burbanks and have similar fryers in their restaurant kitchens the taste of a fast food fry is largely determined by the cooking oil for decades mcdonalds cooked its french fries in a mixture of about  percent cottonseed oil and  percent beef tallow the mix gave the fries their unique flavor  and more saturated beef fat per ounce than a mcdonalds hamburgeramid a barrage of criticism over the amount of cholesterol in their fries mcdonalds switched to pure vegetable oil in  the switch presented the company with an enormous challenge how to make fries that subtly taste like beef without cooking them in tallow a look at the ingredients now used in the preparation of mcdonalds french fries suggests how the problem was solved toward the end of the list is a seemingly innocuous yet oddly mysterious phrase natural flavor that ingredient helps to explain not only why the fries taste so good but also why most fast food  indeed most of the food americans eat today  tastes the way it doesopen your refrigerator your freezer your kitchen cupboards and look at the labels on your food youll find natural flavor or artificial flavor in just about every list of ingredients the similarities between these two broad categories of flavor are far more significant than their differences both are manmade additives that give most processed food most of its taste the initial purchase of a food item may be driven by its packaging or appearance but subsequent purchases are determined mainly by its taste about  percent of the money that americans spend on food is used to buy processed food but the canning freezing and dehydrating techniques used to process food destroy most of its flavor since the end of world war ii a vast industry has arisen in the united states to make processed food palatable without this flavor industry todays fast food industry could not exist the names of the leading american fast food chains and their bestselling menu items have become famous worldwide embedded in our popular culture few people however can name the companies that manufacture fast foods tastethe flavor industry is highly secretive its leading companies will not divulge the precise formulas of flavor compounds or the identities of clients the secrecy is deemed essential for protecting the reputation of beloved brands the fast food chains understandably would like the public to believe that the flavors of their food somehow originate in their restaurant kitchens not in distant factories run by other firmsthe new jersey turnpike runs through the heart of the flavor industry an industrial corridor dotted with refineries and chemical plants international flavors  fragrances iff the worlds largest flavor company has a manufacturing facility off exit a in dayton new jersey givaudan the worlds secondlargest flavor company has a plant in east hanover haarmann  reimer the largest german flavor company has a plant in teterboro as does takasago the largest japanese flavor company flavor dynamics has a plant in south plainfield frutarom is in north bergen elan chemical is in newark dozens of companies manufacture flavors in the corridor between teaneck and south brunswick indeed the area produces about twothirds of the flavor additives sold in the united statesthe iff plant in dayton is a huge pale blue building with a modern office complex attached to the front it sits in an industrial park not far from a basf plastics factory a jolly french toast factory and a plant that manufactures liz claiborne cosmetics dozens of tractortrailers were parked at the iff loading dock the afternoon i visited and a thin cloud of steam floated from the chimney before entering the plant i signed a nondisclosure form promising not to reveal the brand names of products that contain iff flavors the place reminded me of willy wonkas chocolate factory wonderful smells drifted through the hallways men and women in neat white lab coats cheerfully went about their work and hundreds of little glass bottles sat on laboratory tables and shelves the bottles contained powerful but fragile flavor chemicals shielded from light by the brown glass and the round plastic caps shut tight the long chemical names on the little white labels were as mystifying to me as medieval latin they were the oddsounding names of things that would be mixed and poured and turned into new substances like magic potionsi was not invited to see the manufacturing areas of the iff plant where it was thought i might discover trade secrets instead i toured various laboratories and pilot kitchens where the flavors of wellestablished brands are tested or adjusted and where whole new flavors are created iffs snack and savory lab is responsible for the flavor of potato chips corn chips breads crackers breakfast cereals and pet food the confectionery lab devises the flavor for ice cream cookies candies toothpastes mouthwashes and antacids everywhere i looked i saw famous widely advertised products sitting on laboratory desks and tables the beverage lab is full of brightly colored liquids in clear bottles it comes up with the flavor for popular soft drinks sport drinks bottled teas and wine coolers for allnatural juice drinks organic soy drinks beers and malt liquors in one pilot kitchen i saw a dapper food technologist a middleaged man with an elegant tie beneath his lab coat carefully preparing a batch of cookies with white frosting and pinkandwhite sprinkles in another pilot kitchen i saw a pizza oven a grill a milkshake machine and a french fryer identical to those id seen behind the counter at countless fast food restaurantsin addition to being the worlds largest flavor company iff manufactures the smell of six of the ten bestselling fine perfumes in the united states including estée lauders beautiful cliniques happy lancômes trésor and calvin kleins eternity it also makes the smell of household products such as deodorant dishwashing detergent bath soap shampoo furniture polish and floor wax all of these aromas are made through the same basic process the manipulation of volatile chemicals to create a particular smell the basic science behind the scent of your shaving cream is the same as that governing the flavor of your tv dinnerthe aroma of a food can be responsible for as much as  percent of its flavor scientists now believe that human beings acquired the sense of taste as a way to avoid being poisoned edible plants generally taste sweet deadly ones bitter taste is supposed to help us differentiate food thats good for us from food thats not the taste buds on our tongues can detect the presence of half a dozen or so basic tastes including sweet sour bitter salty astringent and umami a taste discovered by japanese researchers a rich and full sense of deliciousness triggered by amino acids in foods such as shellfish mushrooms potatoes and seaweed taste buds offer a relatively limited means of detection however compared to the human olfactory system which can perceive thousands of different chemical aromas indeed flavor is primarily the smell of gases being released by the chemicals youve just put in your mouththe act of drinking sucking or chewing a substance releases its volatile gases they flow out of the mouth and up the nostrils or up the passageway in the back of the mouth to a thin layer of nerve cells called the olfactory epithelium located at the base of the nose right between the eyes the brain combines the complex smell signals from the epithelium with the simple taste signals from the tongue assigns a flavor to whats in your mouth and decides if its something you want to eatbabies like sweet tastes and reject bitter ones we know this because scientists have rubbed various flavors inside the mouths of infants and then recorded their facial reactions a persons food preferences like his or her personality are formed during the first few years of life through a process of socialization toddlers can learn to enjoy hot and spicy food bland health food or fast food depending upon what the people around them eat the human sense of smell is still not fully understood and can be greatly affected by psychological factors and expectations the color of a food can determine the perception of its taste the mind filters out the overwhelming majority of chemical aromas that surround us focusing intently on some ignoring others people can grow accustomed to bad smells or good smells they stop noticing what once seemed overpowering aroma and memory are somehow inextricably linked a smell can suddenly evoke a longforgotten moment the flavors of childhood foods seem to leave an indelible mark and adults often return to them without always knowing why these comfort foods become a source of pleasure and reassurance a fact that fast food chains work hard to promote childhood memories of happy meals can translate into frequent adult visits to mcdonalds like those of the chains heavy users the customers who eat there four or five times a weekthe human craving for flavor has been a largely unacknowledged and unexamined force in history royal empires have been built unexplored lands have been traversed great religions and philosophies have been forever changed by the spice trade in  christopher columbus set sail to find seasoning today the influence of flavor in the world marketplace is no less decisive the rise and fad of corporate empires  of soft drink companies snack food companies and fast food chains  is frequently determined by how their products tastethe flavor industry emerged in the midnineteenth century as processed foods began to be manufactured on a large scale recognizing the need for flavor additives the early food processors turned to perfume companies that had years of experience working with essential oils and volatile aromas the great perfume houses of england france and the netherlands produced many of the first flavor compounds in the early part of the twentieth century germanys powerful chemical industry assumed the technological lead in flavor production legend has it that a german scientist discovered methyl anthranilate one of the first artificial flavors by accident while mixing chemicals in his laboratory suddenly the lab was filled with the sweet smell of grapes methyl anthranilate later became the chief flavoring compound of grape koolaid after world war ii much of the perfume industry shifted from europe to the united states settling in new york city near the garment district and the fashion houses the flavor industry came with it subsequently moving to new jersey to gain more plant capacity manmade flavor additives were used mainly in baked goods candies and sodas until the s when sales of processed food began to soar the invention of gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers  machines capable of detecting volatile gases at low levels  vastly increased the number of flavors that could be synthesized by the mids the american flavor industry was churning out compounds to supply the taste of poptarts bacos tab tang filetofish sandwiches and literally thousands of other new foodsthe american flavor industry now has annual revenues of about  billion approximately ten thousand new processed food products are introduced every year in the united states almost all of them require flavor additives and about nine out of every ten of these new food products fail the latest flavor innovations and corporate realignments are heralded in publications such as food chemical news food engineering chemical market reporter and food product design the growth of iff has mirrored that of the flavor industry as a whole iff was formed in  through the merger of two small companies its annual revenues have grown almost fifteenfold since the early s and it now has manufacturing facilities in twenty countriesthe quality that people seek most of all in a food its flavor is usually present in a quantity too infinitesimal to be measured by any traditional culinary terms such as ounces or teaspoons todays sophisticated spectrometers gas chromatographs and headspace vapor analyzers provide a detailed map of a foods flavor components detecting chemical aromas in amounts as low as one part per billion the human nose however is still more sensitive than any machine yet invented a nose can detect aromas present in quantities of a few parts per trillion  an amount equivalent to  percent complex aromas like those of coffee or roasted meat may be composed of volatile gases from nearly a thousand different chemicals the smell of a strawberry arises from the interaction of at least  different chemicals that are present in minute amounts the chemical that provides the dominant flavor of bell pepper can be tasted in amounts as low as  parts per billion one drop is sufficient to add flavor to five average size swimming pools the flavor additive usually comes last or second to last in a processed foods list of ingredients as a result the flavor of a processed food often costs less than its packaging soft drinks contain a larger proportion of flavor additives than most products the flavor in a twelveounce can of coke costs about half a centthe color additives in processed foods are usually present in even smaller amounts than the flavor compounds many of new jerseys flavor companies also manufacture these color additives which are used to make processed foods look appealing food coloring serves many of the same purposes as lipstick eye shadow mascara  and is often made from the same pigments titanium dioxide for example has proved to be an especially versatile mineral it gives many processed candies frosting and icing their bright white color it is a common ingredient in womens cosmetics and it is the pigment used in many white oil paints and house paints at burger king wendys and mcdonalds coloring agents have been added to many of the soft drinks salad dressings cookies condiments chicken dishes and sandwich bunsstudies have found that the color of a food can greatly affect how its taste is perceived brightly colored foods frequently seem to taste better than blandlooking foods even when the flavor compounds are identical foods that somehow look offcolor often seem to have off tastes for thousands of years human beings have relied on visual cues to help determine what is edible the color of fruit suggests whether it is ripe the color of meat whether it is rancid flavor researchers sometimes use colored lights to modify the influence of visual cues during taste tests during one experiment in the early s people were served an oddly tinted meal of steak and french fries that appeared normal beneath colored lights everyone thought the meal tasted fine until the lighting was changed once it became apparent that the steak was actually blue and the fries were green some people became illthe food and drug administration does not require flavor companies to disclose the ingredients of their additives so long as all the chemicals are considered by the agency to be gras generally regarded as safe this lack of public disclosure enables the companies to maintain the secrecy of their formulas it also hides the fact that flavor compounds sometimes contain more ingredients than the foods being given their taste the ubiquitous phrase artificial strawberry flavor gives little hint of the chemical wizardry and manufacturing skill that can make a highly processed food taste like a strawberrya typical artificial strawberry flavor like the kind found in a burger king strawberry milk shake contains the following ingredients amyl acetate amyl butyrate amyl valerate anethol anisyl formate benzyl acetate benzyl isobutyrate butyric acid cinnamyl isobutyrate cinnamyl valerate cognac essential oil diacetyl dipropyl ketone ethyl acetate ethyl amylketone ethyl butyrate ethyl cinnamate ethyl heptanoate ethyl heptylate ethyl lactate ethyl methylphenylglycidate ethyl nitrate ethyl propionate ethyl valerate heliotropin hydroxyphenylbutanone  percent solution in alcohol αionone isobutyl anthranilate isobutyl butyrate lemon essential oil maltol methylacetophenone methyl anthranilate methyl benzoate methyl cinnamate methyl heptine carbonate methyl naphthyl ketone methyl salicylate mint essential oil neroli essential oil nerolin neryl isobutyrate orris butter phenethyl alcohol rose rum ether γundecalactone vanillin and solventalthough flavors usually arise from a mixture of many different volatile chemicals a single compound often supplies the dominant aroma smelled alone that chemical provides an unmistakable sense of the food ethylmethyl butyrate for example smells just like an apple todays highly processed foods offer a blank palette whatever chemicals you add to them will give them specific tastes adding methylperidylketone makes something taste like popcorn adding ethylhydroxybutanoate makes it taste like marshmallow the possibilities are now almost limitless without affecting the appearance or nutritional value processed foods could even be made with aroma chemicals such as hexanal the smell of freshly cut grass or methyl butanoic acid the smell of body odorthe s were the heyday of artificial flavors the synthetic versions of flavor compounds were not subtle but they did not need to be given the nature of most processed food for the past twenty years food processors have tried hard to use only natural flavors in their products according to the fda these must be derived entirely from natural sources  from herbs spices fruits vegetables beef chicken yeast bark roots etc consumers prefer to see natural flavors on a label out of a belief that they are healthier the distinction between artificial and natural flavors can be somewhat arbitrary and absurd based more on how the flavor has been made than on what it actually contains a natural flavor says terry acree a professor of food science at cornell university is a flavor thats been derived with an outofdate technology natural flavors and artificial flavors sometimes contain exactly the same chemicals produced through different methods amyl acetate for example provides the dominant note of banana flavor when you distill it from bananas with a solvent amyl acetate is a natural flavor when you produce it by mixing vinegar with amyl alcohol adding sulfuric acid as a catalyst amyl acetate is an artificial flavor either way it smells and tastes the same the phrase natural flavor is now listed among the ingredients of everything from stonyfield farm organic strawberry yogurt to taco bell hot taco saucea natural flavor is not necessarily healthier or purer than an artificial one when almond flavor benzaldehyde is derived from natural sources such as peach and apricot pits it contains traces of hydrogen cyanide a deadly poison benzaldehyde derived through a different process  by mixing oil of clove and the banana flavor amyl acetate  does not contain any cyanide nevertheless it is legally considered an artificial flavor and sells at a much lower price natural and artificial flavors are now manufactured at the same chemical plants places that few people would associate with mother nature calling any of these flavors natural requires a flexible attitude toward the english language and a fair amount of ironythe small and elite group of scientists who create most of the flavor in most of the food now consumed in the united states are called flavorists they draw upon a number of disciplines in their work biology psychology physiology and organic chemistry a flavorist is a chemist with a trained nose and a poetic sensibility flavors are created by blending scores of different chemicals in tiny amounts a process governed by scientific principles but demanding a fair amount of art in an age when delicate aromas subtle flavors and microwave ovens do not easily coexist the job of the flavorist is to conjure illusions about processed food and in the words of one flavor companys literature to ensure consumer likeability the flavorists with whom i spoke were charming cosmopolitan and ironic they were also discreet in keeping with the dictates of their trade they were the sort of scientist who not only enjoyed fine wine but could also tell you the chemicals that gave each vintage its unique aroma one flavorist compared his work to composing music a wellmade flavor compound will have a top note followed by a drydown and a levelingoff with different chemicals responsible for each stage the taste of a food can be radically altered by minute changes in the flavoring mix a little odor goes a long way one flavorist saidin order to give a processed food the proper taste a flavorist must always consider the foods mouthfeel  the unique combination of textures and chemical interactions that affects how the flavor is perceived the mouthfeel can be adjusted through the use of various fats gums starches emulsifiers and stabilizers the aroma chemicals of a food can be precisely analyzed but mouthfeel is much harder to measure how does one quantify a french frys crispness food technologists are now conducting basic research in rheology a branch of physics that examines the flow and deformation of materials a number of companies sell sophisticated devices that attempt to measure mouthfeel the taxti texture analyzer produced by the texture technologies corporation performs calculations based on data derived from as many as  separate probes it is essentially a mechanical mouth it gauges the most important rheological properties of a food  the bounce creep breaking point density crunchiness chewiness gumminess lumpiness rubberiness springiness slipperiness smoothness softness wetness juiciness spreadability springback and tackinesssome of the most important advances in flavor manufacturing are now occurring in the field of biotechnology complex flavors are being made through fermentation enzyme reactions fungal cultures and tissue cultures all of the flavors being created through these methods  including the ones being synthesized by funguses  are considered natural flavors by the fda the new enzymebased processes are responsible for extremely lifelike dairy flavors one company now offers not just butter flavor but also fresh creamy butter cheesy butter milky butter savory melted butter and superconcentrated butter flavor in liquid or powder form the development of new fermentation techniques as well as new techniques for heating mixtures of sugar and amino acids have led to the creation of much more realistic meat flavors the mcdonalds corporation will not reveal the exact origin of the natural flavor added to its french fries in response to inquiries from vegetarian journal however mcdonalds did acknowledge that its fries derive some of their characteristic flavor from animal productsother popular fast foods derive their flavor from unexpected sources wendys grilled chicken sandwich for example contains beef extracts burger kings bk broiler chicken breast patty contains natural smoke flavor a firm called red arrow products company specializes in smoke flavor which is added to barbecue sauces and processed meats red arrow manufactures natural smoke flavor by charring sawdust and capturing the aroma chemicals released into the air the smoke is captured in water and then bottled so that other companies can sell food which seems to have been cooked over a firethe vegetarian legal action network recently petitioned the fda to issue new food labeling requirements for foods that contain natural flavors the group wants food processors to list the basic origins of their flavors on their labels at the moment vegetarians often have no way of knowing whether a flavor additive contains beef pork poultry or shellfish one of the most widely used color additives  whose presence is often hidden by the phrase color added  violates a number of religious dietary restrictions may cause allergic reactions in susceptible people and comes from an unusual source cochineal extract also known as carmine or carminic acid is made from the desiccated bodies of female dactlyopius coccus costa a small insect harvested mainly in peru and the canary islands the bug feeds on red cactus berries and color from the berries accumulates in the females and their unhatched larvae the insects are collected dried and ground into pigment it takes about  of them to produce one pound of carmine which is used to make processed foods look pink red or purple dannon strawberry yogurt gets its color from carmine as do many frozen fruit bars candies fruit fillings and ocean spray pinkgrapefruit juice drinkin a meeting room at iff brian grainger let me sample some of the companys flavors it was an unusual taste test there wasnt any food to taste grainger is a senior flavorist at iff a softspoken chemist with graying hair an english accent and a fondness for understatement he could easily be mistaken for a british diplomat or the owner of a west end brasserie with two michelin stars like many in the flavor industry he has an old world oldfashioned sensibility which seems out of step with our brandconscious egocentric age when i suggested that iff should put its own logo on the products that contain its flavors  instead of allowing other brands to enjoy the consumer loyalty and affection inspired by those flavors  grainger politely disagreed assuring me such a thing would never be done in the absence of public credit or acclaim the small and secretive fraternity of flavor chemists praises one anothers work grainger can often tell by analyzing the flavor formula of a product which of his counterparts at a rival firm devised it and he enjoys walking down supermarket aisles looking at the many products that contain his flavors even if no one else knows itgrainger had brought a dozen small glass bottles from the lab after he opened each bottle i dipped a fragrance testing filter into it the filters were long white strips of paper designed to absorb aroma chemicals without producing offnotes before placing the strips of paper before my nose i closed my eyes then i inhaled deeply and one food after another was conjured from the glass bottles i smelled fresh cherries black olives sautéed onions and shrimp graingers most remarkable creation took me by surprise after closing my eyes i suddenly smelled a grilled hamburger the aroma was uncanny almost miraculous it smelled like someone in the room was flipping burgers on a hot grill but when i opened my eyes there was just a narrow strip of white paper and a smiling flavoristeric schlosser is an investigative journalist bestselling author playwright and a
