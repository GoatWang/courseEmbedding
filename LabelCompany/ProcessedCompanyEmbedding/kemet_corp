companys product offerings include tantalum multilayer ceramic solid and electrolytic aluminum and film and paper capacitors it manufactures a broad line of capacitors in many different sizes and configurations using a variety of raw materials the company operates its business through two segments solid capacitors and film and electrolytic the solid capacitors segment products are commonly used in conjunction with integrated circuits and the same circuit may and frequently does contain both ceramic and tantalum capacitors tantalum capacitors are a popular choice because of their ability for high capacitance in a small volume package while ceramic capacitors are more costeffective at lower capacitance values tantalum capacitors are more costeffective at higher capacitance values while solid aluminum capacitors can be more effective in special applications film paper and aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used to support integrated circuits but also are used in the field of power electronics to provide energy for applications such as motor starts power conditioning electromagnetic interference filtering safety and inverters capacitors account for the largest market within the passive component product grouping the film and electrolytic segment produces film paper and electrolytic capacitors this segment operates manufacturing sites throughout europe asia mexico and the united states and maintains a product innovation center in sweden the company was founded in  and is headquartered in simpsonville sc see full profile analyst ratings sell under hold over buy

capacitors through non authorized sources over the past decade the number of non authorized sources for electronic components including kemet capacitors has greatly increased these sources range from individuals selling electronic components out of their homes to large webbased traders and independent distributorsbrokers there is no way to conclusively determine the storagehandling conditions and legitimacy of origin of products bought through non authorized sources product supplied through non authorized sources may appear to be legitimate but many quality issues with such product can occur and kemet cannot warrant product purchased through non authorized sources customers that buy kemet capacitors from non authorized sources may save money in the shortterm but they run the risk of major reliability issues that can damage their reputation and prove enormously expensive in the longterm due to warranty expenses field replacements and liability claims customers that nonetheless turn to non authorized channels for kemet capacitors trade risk for reliability for these reasons kemet corporation strongly encourages all our customers to buy our product exclusively through our authorized
