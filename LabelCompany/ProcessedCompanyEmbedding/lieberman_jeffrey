extraordinary and eyeopening book the path to legitimacy for the black sheep of medicine has been anything but smooth in shrinks dr lieberman traces the field from its birth as a mystic pseudoscience through its adolescence as a cult of shrinks to its late blooming maturity since the second world war as a sciencedriven profession that saves lives with fascinating case studies and portraits of the luminaries of the field from sigmund freud to eric kandel shrinks is a gripping and illuminating read it is also an urgent calltoarms to dispel the stigma surrounding mental illness and to start

categories history of medicine psychiatry review quote shrinks is a great read and is highly recommended by combining clinical case histories and theoretical musings it describes where psychiatry came from and where it is going the author a highly respected clinical research and academic psychiatrist and recent president of the american psychiatric association does not hesitate to describe the soft underbelly of his profession as it matured from a psychoanalytic cult of shrinks into a scientific medicine of the brain especially interesting are descriptions of the professions meanderings into intellectual dead ends from wilhelm reich to thomas szasz and daniel amen equally intriguing is the emergence of todays scientific psychiatry which when practiced skillfully can afford great relief for many psychiatric disorders  e fuller torrey author of surviving schizophrenia only someone such as jeffrey lieberman  has both the clinical and scientific vision to write a modern history of the evolution of psychiatry from its primitive origins to its current promise for the future this highly readable and fully accessible book puts the history of psychiatry into a modern perspective for the general reader  eric kandel university and kavli professor of brain science columbia university and nobel prize winner for medicine and physiology  shrinks is a mustread for anyone who cares about the future of mental health care  ive been a policymaker and a patient for decades yet there was much in here i never really understood before and now that we have mental health parity that understanding is more important than ever a smart important accessible book  patrick j kennedy former us congressman founder of the kennedy forum and cofounder of one mind an authoritative often inspiring account of progress in psychiatry balanced by frank and admirable openness about the fields historical missteps  peter d kramer author of listening to prozac and against depression the most authoritative exploration i have read of the state of contemporary psychiatry  it is also the most hopeful jeffrey liebermans account of the scientific revolution in psychiatry  a revolution that he both participated in and helped to foster  is compelling but it is his candour lack of dogmatism and sensitivity to suffering that will linger in your mind long after youve turned the last page  sylvia nasar author of a beautiful mind shrinks is an excellent way into the world of modern psychiatry its science the limits and benefits of its diagnostic systems and treatments how doctors make good decisions and why they make bad ones shrinks is as thorough as it is lively  kay redfield jamison author of an unquiet mind jeffrey lieberman has produced a masterful behindthescenes examination of psychiatry and by extension the human condition his epic narrative charts the unlikely ascent of the stepchild of medicine from the earliest parlorroom charlatans of animal magnetism to the contentious digital age rollout of the dsm paralleling liebermans own professional transformation from eager psychoanalytic student of freud to neuroscienceminded president of a reformed american psychiatric association a wise and gripping book that tackles one of the most important questions of our time what is mental illness  andrew solomon author of far from the tree and the noonday demon an astonishing book honest sober exciting and humane lieberman writes with the authority of an expert but with the humility of a doctor who has learned to treat the most profound and mysterious forms of mental illnesses  this book brings you to the very forefront of one of the most amazing medical journeys of our time  siddhartha mukherjee author of the emperor of all maladies the most authoritative exploration i have read of the state of contemporary psychiatry  it is also the most hopeful jeffrey liebermans account of the scientific revolution in psychiatry  a revolution that he

good decisions and why they make bad ones shrinks is as thorough as it is lively  kay redfield jamison author of an unquiet mind an informative book  given that the mind is a fragile faculty and the brain is a delicate organ it is sobering to discover from his book what a haphazard discipline psychiatry was until the s  jack carrigan  catholic herald  journeying through the history of psychiatry with jeffrey a lieberman is not unlike being led by voltaires indomitable optimist professor pangloss through the seven years war and the lisbon earthquake  lieberman is a breezy charming and genial guide to a field fraught with difficulties  he is an insider with the kind of experience most professional historians cannot claim  lisa appignanesi  the observer  as a retort to those that still believe there are no mental disorders only diverse mentalities jeffrey liebermans historic and spirited defence of psychiatric diagnoses and treatments has much work to do  this is a humane guide to psychiatrys internal conflicts and a candid account of its claims to scientific credibility  iain finlayson  the times show more about jeffrey a lieberman jeffrey a lieberman has spent over twentyfive
