friends any help message problem reports or the like in a conventional manneraccording to a predetermined setting first wearable device  can transfer information either to another second wearable device  see fig  or to computing device  with reference now to fig  a subroutine for determining where to transfer input information is depicted the subroutine begins at a start terminal  and proceeds to a step  where input information and data to first wearable device  is obtained from step  the process proceeds to a decision step  where it is determined if the type of input is for an nfc device if the input is for an nfc device then the program proceeds to a decision step  where a determination is made if a second nfc device is detected such as second wearable device  fig  if it is not detected then the program repeatedly loops to the top of decision step  until the second nfc device is detected however if decision step  determines that an appropriate nfc device is detected than the program proceeds to step  in which the information is transferred to the second nfc device and then the program terminates in terminal  however if decision step  determines that the input is not for an nfc device then the program branches to a decision step  where it is determined if the type of input is for a bluetooth device if the input is for a bluetooth device then the program proceeds to a decision step  where a determination is made if a bluetooth device is detected such as computing device  fig  if it is not detected then the program repeatedly loops to the top of decision step  until the bluetooth device is detected however if decision step  determines that an appropriate bluetooth device is detected then the program proceeds to step  in which the information is transferred to the bluetooth device and then the program terminates in terminal  it can be predetermined whether the type of input is for a bluetooth device or for a nfc device as demonstrated in fig with reference now to fig  there is presented a table  listing the type of wireless inputs and outputs to and from first wearable device  using either bluetooth or nfc signals as an exemplary in general bluetooth signals are used when there is a greater distance involved such as from first wearable device  to a computing device  such as a smart phone nfc signals are used where the distance is relatively small such as from one first wearable device  to another second wearable device  in close proximity thereto see fig  table  shows that a gps signal and information can be sent from first computing device  to first wearable device  and from first wearable device  to smart phone by a bluetooth signal similarly bluetooth signals are sent to and received by first wearable device  to carry barcode and qr code information andor motion information detected from first wearable device  on the other hand business card stored in memory unit  can be communicated upon command to a nearby wearable device such as second wearable device  by nfc signalswith reference now to fig  a subroutine for calculating caloric consumption is depicted the subroutine begins at a start terminal  and then proceeds to a process step  to scan a barcode of food that a user will be ingesting should the computing capacity at the wearable device be limited the computing process can be executed at computing device  instead of or in addition to that at first wearable device  the subroutine proceeds to a decision step  where it is determined if the user has preset first wearable device  to calculate the calories of the food if the setting is preset in that way then the subroutine proceeds to process step  in which a calculation of the total calories consumed is made from step  the subroutine then determines in process step  the amount of calories burned through exercise by using information about the exercise that is stored on first wearable device  in process step  the calorie information is sent to computing device  in a first computing device  in step  the actiblock  see fig  that contains cumulative calorie information is updated and the subroutine ends at termination terminal if in decision step  it is determined that there is no setting that the calculation is executed on wearable device then the program branches to a second decision step  where it is determined if a first computing device  is present if it is found that there is no first computing device  present then the program loops back to the top of decision step  if there is a first computing device  present then the program proceeds to a process step  where a calculation of the total amount of calories of the selected food is made at first computing device  the program proceeds to process steps  and then  where the caloric information in the smart phone is updated and also sent to first wearable device  respectively then before exiting the subroutine at termination terminal  the program updates first dependent screen  see figs a b and c on first wearable device  in step with reference now to fig  a subroutine is disclosed to determine how much exercise a user has had the subroutine begins in start terminal  and proceeds to a process step  where the motion of a user is recognized and a determination is made as to what type of motion it is in the present embodiment the motions being tracked are those of the wrist on which first wearable device  is being worn but because motion of the wrist and arm of the user will be in synchronization with other motions of the body of the user such as in running or walking a fairly accurate determination can be made as to the type of motion being done for example by determining the velocity and acceleration of an arm being swung it can be determined if the user is walking or running since the distance can be determined by motion detectors  and  by double integrating the measured acceleration and using the elapsed time the speed of motion can be determined and the amount of calories for example can be determined thus the program proceeds from process step  to a decision step  where it is determined if the detected motion is one of a predetermined type of motion if it is not then the program loops back to the top of step  and awaits the recognition of a motion of the user if the detected motion is of a predetermined type the program branches to process step  where a calculation of the number of motions is made the subroutine then proceeds to process step  and then process step  where the motion information is sent to first computing device  where the number of steps taken are calculated and the information stored respectively from step  the subroutine terminates in termination terminal with reference now to figs  and  a process of transferring social information between a first user of a wearable device eg  to a second user of a wearable device eg  as depicted in figs  and  is depicted in the disclosed subroutine and hardware block diagram the social information can be for example information that is contained on a business card this would include such information as name title business or company name business address business telephone and facsimile numbers email address skype name and instant messenger name this information is stored in a signature barcode  or in wearable device memory unit  through an earlier input operation from first computing device  or other computer connection it can also be obtained from a social media network web sites such as facebook linkin and twitterthe subroutine of fig  begins in start terminal  and proceeds to step  where the signature barcode  of second wearable device  of the presumed second user is read by the barcode scanner  of first wearable device  of the first user then the program proceeds to process step  wherein the signature barcode information is saved on first wearable device  from step  the program proceeds to a decision step  wherein it is determined if the computing device  of the first user can be found if no first computing device  can be found the program loops back to the beginning of step  if a first computing device  is detected the program proceeds to process step  where the signature barcode information is sent to computing device  of the first user then the program proceeds to process step  wherein the barcode information is sent to the server  fig  from server  the new “friend” is added to one or more appropriate social networks or a network provided by the present disclosure from step  the program proceeds to process step  and then to termination terminal  in process step  server  verifies and authenticates the information and adds the second smart phone user  to the wearable device of the friendthe schematic of a hardware configuration that illustrates the operation of the subroutine in fig  is depicted in fig  barcode scanner  of the first user reads the signature barcode  of the second wearable device  of the second user through a scanning process first wearable device  is connected through a bluetooth connection to the first computing device  of the first user which in turn is connected by an internet connection eg a wireless connection to a server  server  uploads the information to a designate web site obviously server  is representative and could include other well known alternatives such as cloud computingwith reference now to fig  a subroutine that implements a level of security is depicted the subroutine starts in start terminal  and proceeds to a decision step  where the presence of an nfc near field communications device is determined an nfc device is one that communicates to another nfc device using weak electromagnetic radiation and the nfc protocol over a very short distance from actual touching to a few inches a smart phone uses nfc to communicate such information as business cards photographs and small files to another smart phone if an nfc device is detected the program branches to a second decision step  which inquires if the nfc device detects a predetermined signal one such signal can be a password or predetermined gestures such as handshake if an nfc device is not detected the program loops back to the top of decision step  to await the receipt of an indication that an nfc device is present in a similar manner if a predetermined signal is not detected in decision step  the program loops back to the top of decision step  if a predetermined signal is detected the program proceeds to a process step  where a predetermined function is performed an example of such a function would be to check that a transmitted password is acceptable and to allow communication between the two devices from process step  the program exits the subroutine through a termination terminal a multiuse for a first wearable device  utilizing the same or universal key or password for several different types of devices is depicted in fig  first wearable device  is bidirectionally connected using bluetooth to a first computing device  which could in alternative embodiments also be a general purpose programmed computer system in addition first wearable device  is bidirectionally connected using nfc a scanner or bluetooth to one of several types of transceivers for example wearable device is shown connected to a transceiver  that operates a door to a transceiver  that controls several functions of an automobile eg rolling down the windows starting the car or turning on the heat or air conditioner and to a transceiver  that controls the operation of a copier thus each of these devices can be controlled by a single wearable device code each of transceivers   and  is bidirectionally connected using wireless network to a server  which is also bidirectionally connected using bluetooth to first computing device  the user can use first wearable device  as an universal key for several different types of devices in a case that the user lost first wearable device  the user can change the password for first wearable device  on server with reference now to fig  a subroutine for monitoring a wearable device is depicted the subroutine begins in a start terminal  and immediately goes to a decision step  that determines the time from the last status signal to the present and determines if a signal from wearable device is more than a predetermined amount if the minimum time since the last signal is longer than a predetermined amount the program proceeds to a process step  in which computing device  or first wearable device  sends a warning signal to a server the program then proceeds to a process step  in which the users password is reset or changed and then to termination terminalwith reference to fig  a subroutine for voluntarily or manually changing a password is depicted the subroutine begins in a start terminal  and immediately goes to a decision step  where a user has voluntarily changed a password on first computing device  the program then proceeds to a process step  in which start phone  sends the changed password to first wearable device  from step  the program proceeds to a process step  in which the user is given an opportunity to display the new password in a predetermined manner such as a barcode or a qr code the program then terminates in a termination terminal  thus first wearable device  can display a barcode or a qr code on display assembly  so that the barcode scanner  of another second wearable device  can read and scan the barcode or qr code on the wearable devices  display assembly according to the present disclosure first wearable device  does not need to carry a physical barcode or qr codeaccording to a predetermined setting first wearable device  can transfer information either to another second wearable device  see fig  or computing device  with reference now to fig  a subroutine for general procedure for operating a wearable device is depicted the subroutine begins at a start terminal  and proceeds to a step  where the processor receives an input from a wrist band unit of the wearable device or a signal from a first portable network device from step  the process proceeds to a decision step  where control unit  fig  determines whether the input or the signal is a predetermined type from step  the process proceeds to a communication step  where a network unit communicates with at least one of the first portable network devices a second portable network device and a server via a wireless communication channel from step  the process proceeds to a displaying step  where the display assembly  displays a message from step  the process proceeds to end terminal it is to be understood that the exemplary embodiments
