see as a stand alone fiction book a million little pieces isnt too bad as a factual memoir it isnt too great obviously since its release frey has come out and admitted that many parts of the book were embellished my only question is how did anyone believe it was true to begin with there is no point in rehashing all the details but there is no shortage of things in this book that are not believable in the least and it makes you wonder how oprah and crew so easily had the wool pulled over their eyesthe good the story is somewhat compelling and places the main character in some interesting situations and the character himself while not a likeable person definitely has an interesting history and is probably the only redeeming characteristic of this bookthe bad normal punctuation and grammatical rules are completely ignored in this book this was completely annoying because you are never quite sure when someone is speaking and when they stop the way the author tries to remedy this was quite annoying as well alaleonard speaksthats iti dont know if this is supposed to be an extension of the authorcharacters rebel rebel down with rules attitude but it just makes for an annoying readas stated the main character is not likeable so this makes it hard to root for him or care about him in any way this is compounded by the characters constant chest puffing attitude towards the centers staff and doctors and his constant proclamations that he doesnt need to do it their way the lack of believability also makes it tough to suspend disbelief even though it is fictionoverall with

starsfrom personal experiencebyerika lynnon september  verified purchasei really really liked this book at first i found it kind of annoying because of the use of language and the poor writing skills but having known what its like to be completely drowned out by addiction having no one having nothing not even respect for yourself let alone others i expect nothing less i was later upset when finding out that this book wasnt exactly nonfictional many of the events that frey stated in his writings are made up that just sucks but this review isnt based off of what i heard its based off of the booki found myself not being able to close this book easily it wasnt until my boyfriend complained of starvation and my thinking that his skinny butt might shrivel up and blow away that i had to make him dinner lol but right after dinner i was right back to reading and finished this rather lengthy memoir so to speak in about a day and a half it obviously wasnt the best book ive ever read in my life but i think i enjoyed it so much because i can relate to some of the things frey sayscomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product

now please try again later out of  starswell written though contrivedbyemily greitzeron september  format paperbackverified purchasei have no real qualms with this book other than the deception of calling it a memoir part of the appeal of reading a memoir is trusting that the author is being honest and forthcoming with his account i knew when i began reading this book that it was exaggerated but while i was reading i found myself unable to believe most of it had even happened it just smacked of fiction it seemed unrealistic in parts and i felt the misuse of the label memoir was highly ironic considering how much frey cites honestyaccountability as being crucial parts of healing from addiction in the book the eclectic and chaotic writing style was compelling and i felt easy to read but if youre looking for an accurate believable memoir of addiction i wouldnt read this bookcomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product

through this book the media explosion happened with the smoking gun claiming the book was more a product of great imagination than actual fact i refused to read the article until i had finished the book so i wouldnt be influenced by any seeds of doubt first off regardless of truth or fiction the book is a powerhouse like strapping yourself into the first car of a rollercoaster that combines velocity with hairpin turns it grabs you from the first paragraph and doesnt let go reading it i was shocked that this was an oprah selection and couldnt imagine her viewers digesting thislittered as it is with cursing and vivid descriptions of bodily functions fluids and the most horrific dentist scene since marathon man frey has since admitted hes embellished elements of the story to heighten the drama and after finishing it that seems clear especially the slightly sappy and melodramatic david and lisalike fractured souls falling in love in rehab and an incident with a priest in paris however thats a small blip in what is a great read regardless of if some all or none of it really happenedcomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport
