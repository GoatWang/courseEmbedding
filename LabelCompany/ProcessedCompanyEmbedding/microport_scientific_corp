july  to july  microport endovascular shanghai co ltd microport endovascular attended the th china southern endovascular congress sec in hangzhou zhejiang province and hosted two academic salons focusing on aortic arch treatment strategies and suitable stent structures for different kinds of aortic diseases around  experts from the vascular surgery field were gathered together to discuss hot topics extensively related with vascular diseases on the occasion of sec  microport endovascular invited several experts to deliver keynote speeches of treatment strategies of aortic arch professor jianhua huang of xiangya hospital of central south university lectured on the application of fenestrated technique and hybrid technique in the treatment of arch dissection he pointed out the branch stent is the most reasonable platform to treat aortic arch castor™ branched aortic stentgraft system castor™ has completed clinical trials earlier than several competitors products with unibdy design and good longterm antifatigue performance it is a preferred choice for the revascularization of left subclavian artery lsalater in the speech of how to treat aortic arch fenestrated technique chenmy technique hybrid technique or branch stent professor rui feng of changhai hospital of second military medical university introduced the pros and cons of the four techniques in the revascularization of the supraarch branch he said castor™ represents a brand new idea compared to the other three techniques as its design is consistent with the anatomy of the arch which helps to avoid endoleak and offlabel use professor feng said castor™ has promising future and we are expecting more clinical data to support its longterm outcome afterwards professor xiwei zhang of jiangsu province hospital presented on individualized treatment strategy of aortic arch he said during the endovascular treatment with the arch disease involving the lsa physicians should take the patients condition and hospital resources into consideration to choose the proper treatment according to professor zhang  cases of castor™ premarket clinical trial were enrolled by jiangsu province hospital which achieved  success rate and showed no occurrence of endoleak in oneyear followup since castor™ has obtained approval from china food and drug administration we are expecting it to play a more effective role in clinical application said professor zhang the first academic salon of microport endovascular unibodyanchor to secure the clinical application of stents with unibody design was cochaired by professor lefeng qu of shanghai chengzheng hospital and professor pingfan guo of the first affiliated hospital of fujian medical university professor xianlan zhang of affiliated hospital of guilin medical university professor guanhua xue of renji hospital of shanghai jiao tong university professor mingjin guo of affiliated hospital of qingdao university and professor zhiqi lin of nanfang hospital of southern medical university were invited as keynote speakers to dive into the clinical advantages indications operative skills of the stent graft with unibody design and aegis™ bifurcated stentgraft system aegis™ experts in attendance noted unibody is an ideal design in terms of the anatomical morphology a successful stent is to conform to the anatomy of the aorta rather than forcing the aorta to adapt to the stent graft both castor™ and aegis™ of microport endovascular adopt such perspective unibody design the second academic salon was themed on ahead of the arch  a discussion of the endovascular treatment strategy for the arch disease chaired by professor xiaoming zhang of peking university peoples hospital professor jianhua huang of xiangya hospital of central south university professor xiang feng of changhai hospital of second military medical university professor peiyong hou of liuzhou workers hospital professor minjian kong of the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university school of medicine professor heng lu of fujian medical university union hospital professor hong zhang of affiliated hospital of chengde medical university professor wei li of peking university peoples hospital and professor tong qiao of nanjing drum tower hospital were invited as keynote speakers to discuss hot topics related with aortic arch according to the experts in attendance crossability and positioning of the stent graft are the main concerns in the endovascular treatment of aortic arch especially for the type ⅲ aortic arch with a sharp aortic angle hard sheath tends to flex when passing through the arch which may lead to movement of stent graft during deployment however when the stent graft is delivered and deployed under the protection of the soft sheath the traceability across the arch will be improved as well as the stability during deployment due to less stress incurred by the soft sheath when crossing the arch both castor™ and hercules™ low profile cross thoracic stentgraft adopt the arch with a soft sheath which leads to excellent traceability across the arch arch crossability stale deployment and precise positioning the two salons combined academic exchange display of product sample and stimulator operation in particular it was the first appearance of the simulator of castor™ in an academic conference which attracted wide attention from attendees microport endovascular president zhenghua miao said castor™ provides a creative solution that makes the delivery and positioning of unibody branch stent much easier and features low occurrence of endoleak and good patency in branch vessel once launched we believe it will provide ingenious accurate and safe clinical experience for physicians and benefit more patients
