first approached by the mosaic society of philadelphia and philadelphia’s magic gardens to jury a regional exhibit we asked the organizers – carol shelkin president of msop and ellen owens pmg’s executive director – what they wanted the show to accomplish the title of the exhibit shattering expectations mosaic 0 is a direct reflection of their goal to shine a light on makers who use the medium to create art that is timely relevant and engaging and in doing so break through some old assumptions about mosaic isaiah zagar “the magic gardens”    photo   gabe kirchheimer shattering expectations mosaic 0 would place fine art mosaics within the belly of isaiah zagar’s massive visionary mosaic environment the magic gardens of south philadelphia zagar has mosaicked the interior and exterior walls ceilings and floors of nearly half a block of real estate to create what is at its core a 0 year personal diary that began as a response to a nervous breakdown we found it a no less an

and visions are as strong as their mastery of mosaic techniques this is a group of highlyaccomplished artists most of whom have multiple awardwinning works in their portfolios climate change

personally rewarding opportunity to interact oneonone with viewers  marvelous moments of serendipity ensued  – “that’s jupiter” exclaimed a gentleman upon spying yulia hanansen’s great red spot a subsequent conversation with the artist revealed that the man was connected with the physics department at the university of pennsylvania much to hanansen’s delight he extended an invitation for a private tour of the school’s rittenhouse observatory yulia hanansen and “great red spot” photo anabella wewer glorious spring weather the opening weekend brought over 0 visitors to the gardens some of

mosaic environments what follows is a brief look at work from each of the  artists in the exhibit karen kettering dimit invited artist we have long appreciated dimit’s indepth mosaic exploration of themes that have great meaning for her  she is marvelous at exploiting the natural attributes and cultural associations of her materials to create imagery that can be haunting thought provoking and delightful karen kettering dimit “miss willendorf 00″ 00  x  x  in in her subway goddesses series dimit juxtaposes ancient female archetypes with the “goddesses” of today to examine how cultural stereotypes have impacted her own sense of self esteem in miss willendorf 00 we see the “venus of willendorf “ c  bce –  bce  recast in designer jeans spandex tshirt and lovelorn tattoos karen kettering dimit “nyc watertowers xi”  x  in a second series is devoted to the silent sentinels of new york city – its iconic water towers using natural stone and minerals dimit paints an apocalyptic sky in nyc watertower xii another example of her masterly use of materials a similar work exhibited nyc watertower ix has recently been sold to a mother with an autistic child who “became strongly engaged” with the work no higher praise    yakov hanansen juried artist if there were ever an example of how a photograph does not do a mosaic justice it would be any image taken of yakov hanansen’s stunning work brain yakov hanansen “brain”  x  in handmade ceramic tesserae porcelain smalti we loved this in a jpeg but in person it was just a knock out there were worlds within worlds composed of smalti the rims of ceramic plates and exquisitely handsculpted tesserae in this mosaic light is manipulated through relief reflection texture and shape  shadows are everything  ”white is the compilation of all colors” hanansen told us “the brain is a universe that we are still exploring”  we could easily have spent hours exploring this work which proved to be magnetic for everyone who came within three feet of it something about the intricacy and symmetry in brain is enormously compelling hanansen is very much a mosaic philosopher and his work stands at the intersection of science cosmology and art yakov hanansen “inflection point” 00 0 x  in triptych white and offwhite porcelain hanansen was classically trained as a mosaic muralist in russia but now maintains a studio and school with his wife angele in new york city  while his commission work for architectural installations is often very vivid since the s his personal work has all been in white hanansen is also the father of stained glass mosaic artist yulia hanansen whose work is noteworthy for her marvelous painterly use of color an article by philadelphia writer paul anater about this father daughter mosaic duo appeared in the 0 edition of mosaic art now yulia hanansen juried artist even as she is the daughter of a mosaicist trained in the classical european tradition yulia hanansen is a thoroughly american mosaic artist blazing artistic trails in a material generally eschewed by the europeans – stained glass her “layered mosaic” technique is an innovation she created to add the mosaic element of “relief” to a material that traditionalists find too flat when she points this technique and her artistic training on the astronomical and ecological themes that are her inspiration the result as we noted above with great red spot draws the viewer in instantly yulia hanansen “jupiter great red spot ” 0  x  in layered stained glass it can take hanansen as long as three years to accumulate the materials for a mosaic she has planned  this patience and care is often rewarded great red spot was selected as best in show in the society of mosaic artist’s mosaic arts international 0 “jupiter great red spot” detail displaced hurricane is part of a series hanansen is doing on global warming and potential disruptions to water supplies across the planet in this work we have a satellite’s view of a hurricane system devastating crop circles yulia hanansen “displaced hurricane” 0  x 0 in samantha holmes invited artist samantha holmes “aperiodic asymmetry” 0  x  in aluminum wood samantha holmes academic credentials provide clues to what drives her as artist working in mosaic she holds a ba from harvard and was recently awarded an mfa in experimental mosaic from the academia di belli arti in ravenna she is passionate about bringing intelligence and relevancy to modern mosaic and has put that passion into action with great success the american artist has already represented italy in an exhibit in paris and won several prestigious european mosaic prizes including the innovation award for the young artists  mosaic competition in ravenna holmes’ work combines the most essential elements of the mosaic language – foundational attributes such as individual tesserae andamento interstice permanence etc – with the exploration of the ambiguities of modern life such as the true meaning of “home” thwarted communications and the nature of faith in aperiodic asymmetry the sitespecific work she created for shattering expectations holmes riffs off the traditional islamic tile patterns designed to express divine order in houses of worship “aperiodic asymmetry deals with the disparity between this notion of divine order and the chaos of the human experience the perfection of the underlying geometry and the inaccuracy of the individual hand” explains holmes indeed if you look closely at this mosaic you will see how one small bit of imperfection if allowed to grow quickly breaks down any opportunity for unity aperiodioc asymmetry looked absolutely marvelous in its garden setting rachel sager juried artist pennsylvaniabased artist rachel sager is wellknown for digging into the earth to source materials for her mosaics in the four works shown in shattering expectations sager looks at the earth – and the world as she knows it – through the lens of cartography to explore personal and societal conundrums in here be dragons sager compares the unknown lands depicted as danger zones filled with beastly perils by th century cartographers with the newlyminted cyberlands of facebook and twitter while we all flock to these new lands with their promises of connectivity and opportunity are we making ourselves vulnerable to perils yet to be discovered rachel sager “here be dragons” 0  x  in a crowd favorite at the exhibition was printlandia a work that was the product of a feud between sager and her long malfunctioning printer which culminated in her demolishing the machine and having a final revenge by repurposing its carcass into a mosaic map rachel sager “printlandia” 0  x  in beyond what we admire about sager’s personal art we also have a great appreciation for the incredible work she is doing to promote the mosaic medium organizing exhibitions teaching classes speaking at geological conferences and most recently assisting the touchstone center for craft in creating a mosaic curriculum for its 0 season brava carol stirtonbroad juried artist carol stirtonbroad is a philadelphia artist and teacher who has explored a number of mediums from photography to fiber mosaic has become a major focus for her and she has studied with some of the medium’s most rigorous instructors in italy and the us  that training enabled her to transform the mundane into the sublime in two of the works selected for shattering expectations from my sister’s garden  and from my sister’s garden  carol stirtonbroad “from my sister’s garden ″ 0  x  in carol stirtonbroad “from my sister’s garden ″ 0  x  in using classical mosaic techniques and materials stirtonbroad has given elegance and grace to cow and deer teeth that were unearthed in her sister’s rural garden these two works are just plain beautiful we can’t wait to see more from stirtonbroad in the future carol talkov juried artist carol talkov was a successful costume and interior furnishings fabricator before turning her life to mosaic one can easily see how the love of the materials she works with continues in this new medium in fact she believes that the glass stone minerals and gems she works with have stories within them that can be seen when when they are placed in the right relationship with one another carol talkov “moth” 0 0 x 0 in plume agate petrified wood agate geode chalcedony mica travertine smalti and sea urchin spines are just a few of the materials talkov sourced and carefully selected to use in these dynamic works visitors found these works enormously appealing often getting extraordinarily close to investigate each individual tesserae they are delicious carol talkov “what’s inside” 0  x  x  brooks tower invited artist we have come to think of awardwinning artist brooks tower as a mosaic poet instead of using a pen or keyboard tower employs the heavy duty industrial tools called wet saws and band saws in his modern interpretation of an ancient mosaic technique known as opus sectile  sometimes his mosaics can be a limerick as in i told your sister where a split second of street life and tension is caught in stone and tile brooks tower “i told your sister” 0  x  in other times tower’s work can be likened to psychedisturbing doggerel as in his cartoonlike no pants a poem with a punch line that is any performer’s greatest nightmare brooks tower “no pants” 00  x  in often though tower’s work are hearttugging sonnets to the beauty of every day life as in quaking oats inspired by a simple scene at his breakfast table brooks tower “quaking oats” 0  x  in we think that tower is one of america’s finest mosaic artists and were very pleased to have his work in this exhibit in addition to shattering expectations he is also showing work in tulsa oklahoma’s beautiful new hardesty center in a show entitled art in mosaic shattering expectations mosaic 0 continues through april 0 0 at philadelphia’s magic gardens again
