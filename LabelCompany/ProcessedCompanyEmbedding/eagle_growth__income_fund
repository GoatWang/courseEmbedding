deterioration of company fundamentals indicative of dividend cut occupation of too large a portion of total portfolio development of more attractive investment opportunity a word about risk international investing presents specific risks such as currency fluctuations differences in financial accounting standards as well as potential political and economic instability because the fund normally will hold a focused portfolio of stocks of fewer companies than many other diversified funds the increase or decrease of the value of a single stock may have a greater impact on the funds net asset value and total return as with all equity investing there is the risk that an unexpected change in the market or within the company itself may have an adverse effect on its stock the biggest risk of equity investing is that returns can fluctuate and investors can lose money   stockscountryunited states index  markets index x tweet share this bulletin get news bulletins by email bulletin
