convenience of sampling from home with desired frequency faster turnaround time to get results and at a lower costa conversation with physiciansthe following videos feature perspectives of leading physicians talking about the advantages of liquid biopsy vs tissue biopsy  why is molecular diagnostics important in making treatment decisions for patients with metastatic nsclccertain mutations function as molecular drivers and disrupt the intracellular signal transduction pathway in a way that malignant transformation occurs those oncogenic mutations are not only of prognostic and diagnostic value but they also help us to identify treatment targets  what are the benefits of using a liquid biopsy over surgical biopsy for patients with recurrent nsclc and metastatic diseasetissue diagnostics can be complicated in certain settings including tissue acquisition itself because of difficulttoaccess areas like the bone artifacts can occur by virtue of the tissue preparation and conservation of the specimen and tissue biopsy procedures can be quite uncomfortable for the patient liquid biopsies using urine or blood may make it easier to identify driver and resistance mutations  how might mutational results with a liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor dna differ from those obtained through traditional tissue biopsy methodsliquid biopsies provide certain advantages over tissue biopsies address tumor heterogeneity allow for a more comprehensive molecular assessment of the tumor avoid an invasive often risky surgical procedureinterested in ordering a test order now urine cancer tests  trovagene how do i know if a liquid biopsy test is right for meif you’ve been diagnosed with latestage or metastatic cancer there is a noninvasive liquid biopsy option that may help your physician find the right treatment for you without an additional invasive procedure patient perspective on tissue biopsyjulie“the first tissue biopsy was so painful – i was determined to educate myself about my options and thanks to trovagene i learned there was an alternative to having a another tissue biopsy”peter“i just couldn’t imagine having another tissue biopsy and waiting for my doctor to get the results – it seemed to take forever the last time i want to get started on treatment right away – and i want to know as quickly as possible if my tumor is getting smaller – if my treatment is working”lilly“what if i have a tissue biopsy and my doctor can’t get the information needed to decide what treatment we should try next that’s all i keep thinking – i’ve been through so much already”trovera noninvasive urine and blood based liquid biopsy tests may be an alternative to tissue biopsy results can aid in treatment decisions tests can be done repeatedly and frequently

conjunction with decreased toxicity in advanced nsclc the presence of an egfr driver mutation or acquired resistance mutation tm confers sensitivity to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis such as erlotinib gefitinib and afatinib and osimertinib the use of egfr tkis is based upon the detection of these mutationsthe egfr mutation and cancerthese mutations occur within egfr exons  which encodes a portion of the egfr kinase domain egfr mutations are usually heterozygous with the mutant allele also showing gene amplification approximately  lovly c l horn w pao  egfr in nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc my cancer genome httpswwwmycancergenomeorgcontentdiseaselungcanceregfr updated june  of these mutations are exon  deletions or exon  lr point mutations these mutations increase the kinase activity of egfr leading to hyperactivation of downstream prosurvival signaling pathwaysregardless of ethnicity egfr mutations are more often found in tumors from female never smokers with adenocarcinoma histology however egfr mutations can also be found in other subsets of nsclc including former and current smokers as well as in other histologies in the vast majority of cases egfr mutations are nonoverlapping with other oncogenic mutations found in nsclc such as kras mutations or alk rearrangementsschematic of egfr mutations exons – of the egfr kinase domain are depicted mutations above the schematic are associated with sensitivity to egfr tkis mutations listed below the schematic are associated with egfr tki resistancenote a while most exon  insertions are associated with decreased egfr tki sensitivity the egfr ayinsfqea mutation is an exception and has been associated in retrospective studies with increased egfr tki sensitivity yasuda et al traditional testing for egfractivating mutations in the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor egfr can confer sensitivity to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc testing for mutations in egfr is therefore an important step in the treatmentdecision pathwaytraditionally tissue biopsy has been the standard method used for egfr mutation testing many of the methods specifically detect the most common egfr mutations the development of targeted mutation testing methods and commercially available test kits has enabled sensitive rapid and robust analysis of clinical samples the use of diagnostic methods subsequent to sample micro dissection has also ensured that identification of more rare uncommon mutations is now feasible cytology samples including fine needle aspirate and pleural effusion can be used successfully to determine egfr mutation status provided that sensitive testing methods are used the presence of egfr mutations predicts the sensitivity to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a molecularly defined subset of nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc patients for this reason egfr testing of nsclc is required to provide personalized treatment options and better outcomes for these patients targeted therapy blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific pathways needed for carcinogenesis rather than by broadly interfering with rapidly dividing cells eg with traditional chemotherapyas surgery specimens are not available in the majority of nsclc other currently available dna sources are small biopsies and cytological samples however they often provide limited and lowquality dna material and inconclusive resultsup to  jco    future oncol   of tissue biopsies do not have enough cancer cells to analyze leading to inconclusive results tissue biopsies can be painful carry risks such as bleeding or infection and increase the emotional and physical burden of cancer care additionally tissue biopsy results may take up to  days to receive potentially delaying the information needed to select the appropriate treatment scans and tissue biopsies add significant cost over the course of treatment and may add to cancerrelated stress and anxietyliquid biopsy tests for egfr mutationscertain fragments of dna shed by tumors into the bloodstream can potentially be used to noninvasively detect egfr driver and resistance mutations monitor responses to treatment and disease progressionin order to address issues associated with tissue biopsy the use of surrogate sources of dna such as blood or urine samples which contain circulating tumor dna ctdna has emerged as a new strategy for tumor genotypingfor most tumors a tissue biopsy is challenging – it is costly painful or potentially risky for the patienttoday circulating tumor dna ctdna may hold benefits that the traditional cancer diagnostic methods or tissue biopsies can’t offer such as detection through urine or blood without an invasive procedure like surgery the evolution of sensitive ctdna detection technologies has enabled the development of liquid biopsies with many clinical applicationscirculating tumor dna ctdna liquid
