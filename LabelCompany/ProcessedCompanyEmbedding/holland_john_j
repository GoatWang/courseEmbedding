california usa  next section editorial john j holland professor emeritus of biological sciences at the university of california san diego ucsd died on  october  after a short illness john was a pioneer in rna virology changing the way we think about rna virus evolution he was a scientific leader who served the virology community at the international national and university levels john was an outstanding teacher and mentor who will be greatly missed we thank johns many friends colleagues trainees and family for contributing their remembrances of this remarkable scientist view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide john j holland – john died in mesquite nevada where he had enjoyed retirement with dottie his wife of more than 0 years prior to retirement john was a professor in the department of biology at ucsd and a member of the universitys center for molecular genetics professionally john was an outstanding leader in virology research and teaching establishing paradigms in rna virus molecular biology persistence and evolution personally he had a zest for life and an intense interest in the professional and personal success of his scientific colleagues students and postdoctoral fellows john is remembered for his tremendous intellect integrity and rigorous science and the way in which he infused enthusiasm joy and laughter into the pursuit of excellence his humility and selfeffacing nature would cause him if he were still alive to wave this all off with a loud irreverent comment and a cackle of laughter john holland was born on  november  in pittsburgh pennsylvania he graduated from loyola university in los angeles now loyola marymount university in  with a bs in biology and chemistry he had served in the us army from 0 to  during the korean war with service as a combat infantryman in north korea holland subsequently completed his phd in microbiology at ucla for his doctoral research he worked with m john pickett on genetics and immunity of brucella infections in primary cells from  to  holland was a postdoctoral fellow at the university of minnesota with jerome syverton a virologist and chairman of the department of bacteriology holland wanted to do postdoctoral research with syverton because of his expertise in primary and immortalized human and monkey cell cultures and his pioneering studies demonstrating the replication of different viruses in such cell lines in fact holland had two postdoctoral mentors at minnesota syverton had holland work in lee mclarens lab mclaren was an assistant and then associate professor while holland was there holland published his first virology papers while at minnesota providing fundamental knowledge about poliovirus replication his work was the first to demonstrate that the block to poliovirus growth in nonprimate cells was due to the absence of specific receptors and that poliovirus nucleic acid alone could be used to infect nonsusceptible cells   beyond their crucial biological implications these studies demonstrated how holland would emerge as a central figure in applying molecular biology approaches to the study of viruses holland was an assistant professor in the department of bacteriology and immunology at the university of minnesota from  to  and then he moved to the university of washington where he was an assistant and then associate professor of microbiology from  to  his research during this time focused on receptor affinities as major determinants of the tissue tropisms of enteroviruses  holland and his colleagues also obtained some of the first convincing evidence that poliovirus replication occurred in the cytoplasm of infected cells and that poliovirus rna could be encapsidated in coxsackievirus virions providing the first demonstration of “enclosure of an animal virus genome within the capsid of a heterologous virus” by a nonenveloped virus   in  holland was awarded the american society for microbiologys eli lilly award the award is given annually for outstanding research of unusual merit and at the time it was given to a scientist under  years of age the award cited hollands “research on the early stages of cellvirus interaction that culminated in a new concept of the dynamics of cellvirus interaction new information on receptor development by cells and an extensive documentation of the controlling role played by these receptors in infection” as an award recipient he was invited to contribute a review article which encapsulates his findings on the species tissue and cell specificity of poliovirus  holland was recruited to be the founding chairman of the department of molecular and cell biology now called the department of molecular biology and biochemistry at the university of california irvine uc irvine in  a year before classes started on campus his first temporary lab at uc irvine overlooked a majestic freshwater marsh adjacent to the campus now known as the san joaquin marsh reserve holland often remarked that this laboratory setting although temporary and quite rustic was one of the favorites he experienced in science at irvine he embarked on experiments examining the fundamental molecular biology of mammalian cell protein synthesis using virusinfected cells as a tool he demonstrated that the host cell has little influence on the relative proportion of viral proteins synthesized but a profound role in determining the rate and total amount of viral protein and virion synthesis  in a seminal paper published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences in  holland and his colleague don kiehn demonstrated that mrnas of enteroviruses and other picornaviruses are translated to produce very large proteins that are then specifically cleaved into smaller functional proteins required for virus replication  this work along with similar findings made independently by don summers and jake maizel and by michael jacobson and david baltimore had major implications for our understanding of how positivestrand rna viruses generate their functional polypeptides and it paved the way for the discovery of virusencoded proteinases hollands work on picornavirus protein processing and replication was highly innovative and characterized by a “simple but elegant” experimental approach these characteristics of hollands approach to experimental virology formed a theme that ran throughout his entire research career in  holland was recruited to the department of biology at the university of california san diego he began working on enveloped viruses and the composition of mammalian cell membranes at about that time most of his research was carried out with vesicular stomatitis virus vsv an enveloped negativestrand rna virus but he also studied influenza and rabies viruses at that time a number of investigators were characterizing heterologous virus interference in coinfections holland and his laboratory colleague mike doyle demonstrated the dominance of poliovirus in a coinfection with vsv vsv virion production is inhibited at the level of viral mrna translation  holland and colleagues also investigated homologous interference conferred by defective interfering particles of vsv in vitro and in vivo highly purified defective interfering particles in high doses protect mice against challenges of otherwiselethal low doses of standard vsv and alter the disease process 0 this work led to subsequent findings that vsv defective interfering particles mediate persistent viral infections in part by suppressing virion transcriptase  to further investigate persistence holland started longterm persistent infections of vsv with standard virus plus defective interfering particles in the days before rapid rna genome sequencing methods holland and colleagues documented vsv genome mutations by oligonucleotide fingerprinting in viruses derived from the persistent infections over a period of more than  years  this led to what are undoubtedly some of hollands best known contributions among current virologists in the area of rna virus evolution in a landmark treatise entitled “rapid evolution of rna genomes” holland carefully reviewed the literature on rna virus mutation frequencies accumulation of rna genome mutations and rna virus recombination and combined it with his knowledge of rapid evolution of rna viruses during serial highmultiplicity passage and effects of defective interfering particles  he discussed the implication of high rna virus mutation rates for persistent virus infections and human degenerative diseases and the implications for general evolution according to google scholar this paper has been cited nearly 0 times subsequent studies many of which were carried out with his longterm collaborator esteban domingo led to the now widely accepted concept of virus quasispecies  using novel quantitative experimental approaches holland and his coworkers greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that have generated genetic diversity among rna viruses and ultimately among living organisms in general holland served the virology community as a member of nih american cancer society and us army grant review panels and journal editorial boards and as a coorganizer of an international colloquium on rhabdoviruses he served on the panel of virus diseases of the usjapan panel for cooperative medical sciences and the us institute of medicinenational academy of sciences committee on microbial threats to health holland was also an excellent classroom teacher his undergraduate medical microbiology course was consistently well received johns scientific legacy includes not only his more than 0 original research papers and review articles in respected and prestigious scientific journals but also his contribution to the careers of many others he trained a significant number of phd students postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate researchers who now have academic positions in major universities and research institutions in the united states and europe or positions in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries many of these individuals still carry out research in virology moreover he graciously hosted visiting professors on sabbatical who were enriched by and themselves enriched the holland lab johns laboratory was unique he worked in the lab with an uninhibited joy until retirement this was educational inspirational and entertaining for those of us fortunate to work with him he was a great model of how to do excellent science think critically and persist in the pursuit of knowledge he could laugh at his own mistakes and empathize with other lab members technical failures after his trainees left the lab he happily corresponded regularly with them about politics sports science and philosophy until a few days before his death john had a rich life outside the laboratory both before and after retirement he enjoyed trout fishing and backpacking in the sierra nevada mountains which he began at an early age with his brother rich john continued the backpacking tradition with his son mark who recalls that john was his most relaxed and at home in the mountains johns love of nature was also fulfilled by hiking in the desert in new mexico and nevada he took pride in baking excellent french bread that he shared with the lab and in his typical thorough style john built an outdoor woodfired oven to produce the bread he had come to love while on sabbatical in geneva switzerland john was an avid vegetable gardener and he also painted large oil landscapes he had a singleengine private pilots license and a glider pilot license and generously treated members of the lab to glider flights in retirement john enjoyed having more time to satisfy his intellectual curiosity he researched specific topics related to quantum mechanics and also pursued an interest in powering internal combustion engines with carbohydrates for which he received a patent in 0  john is survived by his wife dottie mesquite nv his children mark albuquerque nm and lynn and grandchildren molly and megan san clemente ca and three siblings mary frieze los angeles ca george holland mammoth lakes ca and bob holland mesquite nv johns beloved dogs milo and millie also survive him dogs were a very large part of johns life from childhood on and one anecdote vividly illustrates that when john returned from his army service in korea his dog had a moment of hesitation then when she remembered who he was both the dog and john had the most joyous reunion happy that they hadnt forgotten each other john once wrote that all three of his mentors drs pickett syverton and mclaren loved bench science worked at the bench whenever they could all their lives and were smarter and worked harder than john and that he tried to emulate them as human beings not surprisingly those of us who worked with john would say the same about him he was also a model of scientific altruism ethical behavior and the highest standards of excellence he had a profound impact on virology and scientists and his intellect wit and imagination will be long remembered an
