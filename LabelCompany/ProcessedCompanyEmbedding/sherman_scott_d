particularly interested in the field and yet    i found this book fascinating it explains in language a layman can understand why some businesses fail and others succeed the explanations are accompanied by compelling anecdotes about companies we all know and the graphs  beautifully done in color  are fully and simply explained by the author in the same easytofollow style as the rest of the book i came away feeling i had learned a tremendous amount without any sense of having done homework that is quite a feat as an unexpected aside the book is printed on quality paper for those who love holding a hard copy there is a noticeable difference from most books it actually feels luxurious to read  of  people found the following review helpful the solution is to be a cat and do things a bit differently and be more innovative than the group of dumb dogs who spend more ti by autammedotcom a curious title sets off this somewhat different informative and thoughtprovoking book about how to find a position for longterm company growththis book is the distillation of the author’s experience as a business consultant and educator made into a threepart strategy that focusses on allowing a company to survive in industries embroiled in “dogfights”—whereby there is intense competition among established companies for a small piece of the market the solution is to be a cat and do things a bit differently and be more innovative than the group of dumb dogs who spend more time fighting each other than looking forwardit was an enjoyable read mixing theory opinion and practical strategies together to great effect the author allowed his humour and character to shine through this book and it felt as if helped make a difference an authentic personable and informative persona set tone and authoritypunches are not pulled and criticism is freely given about “holy cows” such as models from bcg and porter and how they can be blindly and inappropriately applied in many situations it felt as if it could also be a great primer or summary for those who need a bit of a management strategy reboot and for students and newcomers to the sector it may be an invaluable different read some of the case studies alone could be worth the modest price of this bookit is a hefty book something you won’t read in one sitting yet this is no bad thing and the book does deserve your undivided attention your business and your career may thank you for it too there are extensive references for those who want to dig even deeper into source material and gain further knowledgethis is definitely something
