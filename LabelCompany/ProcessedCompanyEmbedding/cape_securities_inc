satisfaction guarantee  satisfaction guaranteed  day money back guarantee  three year product warranty nearly one million americans trustsimplisafe to protect them here’s why dennis r amarillo tx this morning at  am my phone rang it was the simplisafe operator telling me that my alarm was going off i had them call the police and they were there within minutes the glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away we only had to replace a small pane of glass greg w clarksville tn our home was burglarized two weeks ago i purchased a system that night and installed it within the week today the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off the officers were at my home within minutes nothing was taken simplisafe works lauren b tacoma wa we installed our system and within one week the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm sure enough the tp valve had opened on our water heater the monitoring service alerted us in under  seconds no water damage whatsoever way to go simplisafe our system paid for itself that day stephanie t toledo oh i love my system it saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in northern ohio on the coldest day in february ° the monitoring center alerted us in florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast we were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage simplisafe is recommended by abc fox news nbc  more “no installation no annual contracts very smart” “everything is included and it’s portable so if you change apartments you can just bring it with you” “david vs goliath simplisafe vs adt simplisafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want even without fancy marketing word is spreading” see review simplisafe is not for you if  you have a huge home if your home is larger than  square feet about the size of a football field—or if it has more than  windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors our advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about  you run a large commercial property such as a shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a system that has cctv or security guards in which case you should probably go to one of the traditional contract security companies—and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about however if you’re one of the  of people who don’t run a large commercial property then simplisafe is probably the best choice for you if you’re in any doubt contact one of our security consultants at  for free friendly advice protect your whole house in under an hour this secret to easy installation will save you hundreds—see how simplisafe’s wireless sensors are so easy to install even your kids
