the online consumer lending while the spinoff would assist in the valuation of the bdc as the market has made it clear that assets like clo equity should not be in a bdc despite our belief that clo equity is a great asset class the spinoffs are not ridding psec of the nonbdc assets in their entirety additionally fees at psec need to be reduced substantially the base fee is near the high end of
