executive director thanks mike good morning everybody and thanks for joining us today were pleased to report another quarter with higher than expected adjusted earnings growth driven by significantly improved operating margins although revenue performance was below our expectations due to headwinds in several international regions all of our businesses continue to perform strongly in the united states where we saw a pro forma revenue growth of over  adjusted earnings per share of  were ahead of guidance and up  over  this is our ninth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear adjusted earnings improvement underlying our strong earnings growth was an increase in revenue of  adjusted operating income growth of  and a basispoint improvement in adjusted operating margin at our september  investor conference we committed to improve operating margins  basis points to  basis points by  for the first half of  our adjusted operating margin is up  basis points over last year so were well on our way to our lrp commitment for the first six months of the year the basispoint operating margin improvement was driven by an increased adjusted gross margin of  basis points this improvement is due to the addition of the highermargin welch allyn business continued strong performance in north america portfolio optimization and operational efficiencies in addition to the strong gross margin improvement for the quarter and yeartodate periods were achieving solid sga leverage across the company as we drive additional synergy savings and integrate operations around the world so on the margin front were having a great year which is driving better than expected adjusted earnings turning to revenue similar to the first quarter our growth rate was negatively impacted by  due to declines in our capitaldependent businesses in the middle east and latin america although overall revenue for the quarter was below our expectations we are pleased with the  pro forma constant currency growth rate in the first half of the year this is in line with our  to  lrp growth objectives of  to  let me spend a few minutes addressing what were seeing in our various businesses and geographies from a revenue perspective starting with welch allyn i couldnt be more pleased with how welch allyn has performed posting pro forma yeartodate constant currency growth of  this was driven by an exceptional performance in the united states where we saw a growth of  in the second quarter following a very strong first quarter welch allyn internationally was up about  on a pro forma basis the integration of welch allyn has also gone very well we are exceeding our revenue expectations delivering ahead of our synergy targets and seeing real value of our expanded portfolio with customers carlyn and his team have done a great job integrating welch allyn into the company without missing a beat with our recent new product introductions together with additional commercial synergy opportunities we are very optimistic about the future growth potential for welch allyn north america had another strong performance with revenue up about  for the quarter and yeartodate we had another very solid performance by our sales team with product and service orders up  for the quarter and  yeartodate order backlog is up about  at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year were seeing particularly strong growth in our icu franchise and clinical workflow solutions business reflecting the benefit of new product introductions over the past several years on the rental side in north america we posted revenue growth of  and again improved our adjusted gross margin to the highest level in nearly two years so were pleased with the growth and margin performance in north america in the first half of the year looking forward to the second half we expect the business to continue to perform well although yearoveryear comparisons will be more challenging that said we expect the overall environment in north america to remain steady our surgical business performed very well domestically where we saw  growth in q however similar to our pss business we had a tough quarter internationally where we saw revenue declines in all regions with the exception of asia pacific overall surgical constant currency revenue was down about  for the quarter driven by the international weakness we remain very optimistic about our ability to accelerate surgical growth driven by new product introductions and the channel leverage were seeing in markets around the world for the second half of this year we expect to see accelerated growth over the first half due to our new products and seasonality similar to what we saw last year we are optimistic about the partnership we recently announced with intuitive surgical customer reception to our new integrated motion product has been very positive you may recall we received fda approval during the second quarter and although revenue for the quarter was not material we expect adoption of this product to accelerate growth in our surgical business in the second half of  our international segment which is largely our international pss business has had a tough six months particularly in the second quarter where constant currency revenue declined  we experienced declines in most major regions with the largest percentage declines in the middle east and latin america you may recall we began implementing some organizational changes throughout our international leadership team in the second half of fiscal  those changes including integrating our country and regional operations under common leadership across our businesses are now largely behind us im confident we will see improved performance internationally in the second half of  and as we move into next year although we expect a stronger second half compared to the first six months of the year we have lowered our full year revenue outlook in addition to solid earnings growth for the first half of the year we are on track with the initiatives we highlighted at our september investor conference we are delivering on our commitment to improve gross and operating margins and are well on our way to our  goals in addition most of the benefits from our manufacturing footprint optimization and procurement consolidation lie ahead of us these actions are expected to yield additional margin expansion beyond  were also driving portfolio optimization initiatives which are improving our revenue and margin profile looking forward we still have several lower growth and lower margin product lines that we plan to exit providing additional improvements to our revenue mix and margins our increased investment in innovation is resulting in a steady stream of new product introductions across the portfolio as you saw in our press release and recently with the integrated table motion product in our surgical franchise this will continue to accelerate revenue growth in the future a clear commitment and necessity for us as we look forward to the remainder of  we are tightening our earnings guidance to the higher end of our previous range despite the reduction in our full year revenue outlook we now expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately  up over  basis points reflecting our disciplined operational focus with that let me turn the call over to steve steven j strobel  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks john and good morning everyone before we get started id like to highlight some financial reporting changes were making this quarter first regarding segment reporting during the quarter we formally began operating our front line care segment which includes welch allyn and our global respiratory care business the surgical portion of our former surgical and respiratory care segment will now be referred to as surgical solutions and is comprised of our trumpf aspen and allyn franchise additionally we have changed the term capital sales to product sales and service to better describe the more diversified revenue streams we have achieved through our ma activities in product development over the past several years so now lets shift to the financial results second quarter revenue increased  to  million on a constant currency basis total revenue was up  and up  over pro forma  revenue which combines standalone welch allyn revenue with the previously reported revenue of hillrom product sales and service revenue increased  to  million on a pro forma constant currency basis the increase was  and rental revenue grew to  million a  increase us revenue increased  to  million on a pro forma basis us revenue increased approximately  behind solid growth in each of our segments revenue outside the united states increased to  million a constant currency increase of  driven by the addition of welch allyn turning to revenue by segment north america revenue increased  to  million or  constant currency north america product sales and service revenue increased  to  million driven by continued strong growth in our icu franchise and clinical workflow solutions second quarter product sales and service orders were up  from the prior year in addition the second quarter backlog increased  versus prior year north america rental revenue increased  to  million driven by increased volume front line care revenue was  million in the quarter we again saw a strong growth in welch allyn as pro forma constant currency growth was  driven by  sales growth in the united states we continue to make good progress on the integration and are pleased with welch allyns yeartodate performance the respiratory care franchise of this segment recorded growth of approximately  for the quarter moving to surgical solutions revenue decreased  on a constant currency basis to  million us sales growth of  was offset by international declines particularly in the middle east and latin america our international segment revenue was  million down  on a constant currency basis we continue to see significant headwinds in our international segment as we experienced larger than expected declines in most regions similar to the first quarter we saw the largest percentage declines in latin america and the middle east adjusted gross margin was  an increase of  basis points compared to the prior year driven by the addition of welch allyn as well as organic improvements yearoveryear adjusted product sales and service gross margin increased  basis points to  the increase was driven by the addition of welch allyn favorable sales mix and improved operational efficiencies rental gross margin in the quarter was  a decrease of  basis points versus the prior year moving on to operating expenses rd increased  yearoveryear driven by the addition of welch allyn and a  increase in organic investment adjusted sga increased  yearoveryear driven largely by welch allyn and as a percentage of revenue adjusted sga was down  basis points adjusted operating profit for the quarter was  million an increase of  from the previous year and as a result of the increased gross margin and sga leverage adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased  basis points versus the prior year to  the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at  compared to  in the prior year so to summarize the income statement we achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of  in the second quarter an increase of  over the prior year earnings were driven by the additional of welch allyn strong revenue growth in the united states across all of our businesses and improved operating margins looking at yeartodate results adjusted earnings per diluted share grew  to  highlighted by a basispoint expansion in adjusted operating margins yeartodate operating cash flow of  million compares to  million last year the current period included planned outflows of approximately  million related to the welch allyn acquisition and related ongoing integration activities yeartodate capital expenditures of  million declined significantly from  which included as youll remember sizable investments in our rental fleet now lets move on to  guidance for fiscal  we now expect reported revenue of between  billion and  billion compared to our previous guidance of  billion to  billion as international sales declines are more than offsetting the continued strength we see in the united states our forecast is based on the following assumptions low to midsingledigit constant currency pro forma revenue growth more specifically midsingledigit constant currency revenue growth in north america mid to highsingledigit pro forma constant currency revenue growth in front line care surgical solutions constant currency revenue growth in the low single digits international segment revenue decline of  to  on a constant currency basis compared to midsingledigit declines previously and we continue to expect a negative impact from currency of approximately  to  at current rates moving to earnings we now expect fiscal  adjusted earnings per diluted share of between  and  compared to  to  previously our revised earnings forecast assumes gross margin of approximately  compared to  to  previously rd spending of approximately  of sales adjusted sga spend of approximately  to  of sales a tax rate of  to  and we expect approximately  million to  million shares outstanding for the year to summarize our revised  forecast translates to an adjusted operating margin of approximately  reflecting an increase of over  basis points compared to the prior year and a  to  growth in adjusted earnings per share we continue to project  reported operating cash flow to be approximately  million and capital expenditures of approximately  million to  million now moving to the third quarter we expect reported revenue of between  million and  million this reflects lowsingledigit constant currency pro forma revenue growth and a negative impact from currency of approximately  at current rates we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of  to  compared to  in fiscal  and with that ill turn the call back over to john john j greisch  president ceo  executive director thanks steve so we had a strong quarter and first half of the year on a number of fronts were particularly pleased with the margin expansion and earnings growth we have achieved welch allyn is a great example of the kind of strategic move we are focused on to drive improvement to our company it has been seamlessly integrated and is performing ahead of expectations as the same time our north american pss business continues to perform very well we expect to drive incremental growth in both of these businesses with more new products and investments behind our higher margin higher growth potential products and service offerings such as our clinical workflow solutions business internationally were excited by the opportunity to leverage our broader portfolio into markets around the world while we ride out the economic and political challenges in several of our key geographies currently affecting some of our more capitaldependent businesses we are redeploying resources as quickly as we can to accelerate growth in markets where the greatest potential exists and where businesses such as welch allyn and surgical have been underpenetrated were well on our way towards our lrp goals looking forward we remain focused and committed to driving improved margins and earnings and deploying our strong cash flow in a valuecreating manner with that operator please open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of david roman from goldman sachs your line is now open david harrison roman  goldman sachs  co thank you and good morning everyone john j greisch  president ceo  executive director hi david david harrison roman  goldman sachs  co hey john hey steve i wanted to start with the international businesses particularly in the surgical and respiratory franchises i know you made some reference to certain regions that were a challenge in the quarter but can you maybe just go into a little bit more detail on whats happening exus and what changed specifically in the second quarter and then what gives you confidence in the turnaround to the back half of the year besides the comps john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah ill take the first crack at that david and then ask carlyn to talk about what changes we have made there to drive growth you heard in our comments most of the shortfall in surgical and respiratory specifically but also in our pss business has been in the middle east and latin america where everybody on this call is well aware of whats going on in those regions for us with the heavy capital reliance that we have with particularly our pss and surgical businesses internationally they were getting hit harder probably than most med device companies because of the capital squeeze thats going on in the middle east the brazils the mexicos so those two regions were the majority of the decline in surgical and pss internationally if you look at asia pacific for us as a company we were up about  overall including in our surgical business in that region so good growth in the region where you expect growth to be strongest and really across all the businesses were seeing good activity good growth good margin performance there as well the biggest surprise we had this quarter was in europe in our pss business you heard me comment on some portfolio optimization moves were making so were going to continue to shrink where we are not seeing growth and margin potential and just as you saw this quarter that helps drive our margin and our earnings growth at a faster rate than revenues as we get rid of some of the lower growth lower margin product categories there were some of that in europe but we had a disappointing performance in europe this year if there was one surprise in the quarter it was in our european pss business and we do expect that to turn around on the back of some of the changes which carlyn can comment on but surgical in the middle east latin america together with pss is going to continue to struggle asia pacific very pleased with the  growth europe is where we have most of the work ahead of us carlyn you want to add to that carlyn d solomon  chief operating officer yeah so one thing i would add is in our surgical business our trumpf business when we purchased this business we had a number of bb contracts that we provided tables to at a very very low margin and we started to execute or exit some of those businesses as john mentioned were continuing to look at the portfolio so that influences the growth rate internationally as those sales occurred in europe but let me take you back up to another level our strategy we laid out for you guys internationally as were coming together in one international division all three gbus will be represented were doing this in an effort to be more effective and more efficient as we communicate the values of our products in the international arena so what that leads to and our strategy or as john said there are some assets that we are exiting like the trumpf bb stuff that i mentioned that was low margin there will be others to come and were emphasizing other products in our portfolio because coming together as one international division lets us do that much more easily things like cws which hasnt been emphasized internationally were developing products and starting to launch some of those internationally our respiratory care products have been underrepresented as john mentioned some of our surgical products have been underrepresented so we want to correct that and then were also shipping resources from lowermargin products to highermargin products and you see the good growth rate weve already started that in welch allyn you see the nice growth rate that weve had in welch allyn internationally and well continue to do that were going to do that very aggressively the other reason part of our strategy in bringing together a single international division is to become more efficient and were in the middle of that right now probably on the back end of it but were combining offices to take expenses out were combining management as well thats driving some expenses out and some of the support people in the regions so when you couple all that weve made tremendous progress in executing this strategy as john said what we saw in our pss business in europe was really a surprise and disappointing to us and were going to work aggressively to fix it but aside from that i would say were on track with the strategy that we had prepared and shared with you david harrison roman  goldman sachs  co and then maybe just to follow up on the us side of the business the order growth and backlog that youre reporting is still growing at a very healthy rate despite the fact that i think were now  months into whats been a better capital period for the company could you just maybe john update us on your thoughts on the sustainability there especially as what appears to be looking across the us medical device and hospital network a fairly strong set of results over the course of the first quarter at least that would suggest that theres quite a bit of momentum left to go and that franchise would you agree with that characterization and maybe give us your thoughts on how that business might unfold over the balance of the year and then on a forward john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yes so i would agree with that david i think you saw that across our portfolio here in the us where we were up  on a proforma basis so assuming we had owned welch allyn last year overall were up  our surgical business was up  our north america pss business up  welch allyn up  outstanding performance across the portfolio in the us very consistent and even in many cases strong than i think what youre seeing across the med device landscape specific to the pss business we feel really good about the momentum in that business orders were up strongly the backlog is up strongly as we look forward into the rest of this year we see no signs of weakening of – in terms of the order rates i think i mentioned in my prepared comments weve got some tougher comps in the second half of the year so the growth rates are going to slow down a little bit but as weve demonstrated here this quarter and the last several quarters we continue to over deliver in that business and as you well know its not the easiest one to see around the corner with but as far as we see today and i think i made the same comment last quarter the quote bank that weve got and the activity we were seeing we feel really good about the activity not just in the pss business but again across the portfolio and i think if you go back to carlyns comments just on the strategy this is a work in process and were seeing the benefits of exactly the moves weve made over the last couple of years trumpf in the sates up  with the surgical business overall welch allyn nearly double the growth rate that that business had been achieving before we bought it so the moves that weve made strategically the growth and the change to the profile of the company that were trying to drive through some of the moves weve made were certainly achieving those unfortunately were running into some big headwinds in some regions internationally which were going to fight through and as carlyn said where there is lower margin lower growth opportunity expect us to continue to – improving the portfolio particularly internationally where weve got some opportunities to do so david harrison roman  goldman sachs  co terrific thank you for all the perspective john j greisch  president ceo  executive director thanks david carlyn d solomon  chief operating officer thanks david operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of david lewis of morgan stanley your line is now open david r lewis  morgan stanley  co llc good morning unknown speaker morning david r lewis  morgan stanley  co llc john and maybe carlyn ill start with you i just want to come back to some of davids questions and push you a little bit more so i think they were sort of the pulls in the quarter here so carlyn listened to you talk about europe i feel like theres a component thats in your control and component thats not in your control clearly youre in control with the businesses that you exit was it more this quarter of this disruption associated with the reorganization that really surprised you and then for john in the us youve given us sort of this exhca capital number or backlog number in the past wonder if you can let us know what that number is and i had a quick question on profitability as a followup john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah ill take the second one first because its easy hca orders this quarter were very minor so not much impact at all and i think thats true with the backlog as well david so the underlying strength were seeing in north america really is across the board without the benefit of some of the big additions from hca that youve seen over the past  months carlyn d solomon  chief operating officer yeah and david just to add a little bit to that as well dont forget were innovating in the us so some of our growth and throughout the globe but this is taking hold first in the us so some of the new products that we talked about at our investor conference theyre doing quite well cws is one thats been mentioned as far as the reorg i think youre on it i think one of the key things that happened in the quarter is we had very significant changes the management structure reporting structure some sites that are being told that theyre going to be closed and were consolidating things i believe that absolutely had a large effect on the results that we saw the environment isnt great in europe but certainly better than what we posted and so i think that was a very big part of the results we saw david r lewis  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you for that clarification and then speaking about profitability john one of the real debates on analyst day was that you gave an x number for margin expansion over the lrp half of that came from welch allyn half of it didnt and i think investors are very focused on the underlying improvements so beginning with this quarter the profitability is obviously better what are the drivers and sustainability of that profitability why are you still confident and specifically in this quarter how much of that operating margin improvement has been mix basically from the deal and how much of that is coming from organic sources thank you john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah i wont quantify it david but the three main sources are welch allyn clearly adding – i think we said coming into year it was going to add a couple of hundred basis points to our margins you saw more of that in q because of the low base that our first quarter generally has so the mix impact of welch allyn was even stronger in q we expect that to continue the couple hundred basis points as we go forward this year the rest of it for the full year i think you heard steve say were expecting our operating margin to be up over  basis points for the full year to a  level which is a significant improvement from where we have been about twothirds of that is welch allyn a third is coming from the organic business some of it is geographic mix some of its the new products and innovation benefit that carlyn mentioned and some of it is grinding out some of the portfolio optimization moves that we have i think as we look forward even more importantly than this year in addition to the manufacturing footprint moves that we talked about in september and as i mentioned in my prepared comments are yet to come i think some of the benefits of our new products margin uplifts together with exiting – and its probably a ish million number that we plan to exit here in the coming quarters of revenue thats just not contributing all of thats going to continue to contribute to our margin expansion and sitting here today i think we feel even better about the commitment that we made on our margin opportunities back in september because of the progress weve made weve overachieved on our synergies here in year one so the margin story and the margin opportunities from all of those areas i think we continue to feel highly confident in david r lewis  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bob hopkins of bank of america your line is now open robert a hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch hi great thanks and thanks for taking the question and good morning john j greisch  president ceo  executive director hi bob good morning robert a hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch hey so john its been frustrating because you guys are so close to firing on all cylinders so i have a couple of questions just on europe not surprisingly i guess my first question is just a really easy one was the weakness that youre seeing kind of all throughout the quarter or was this more towards the very end of the quarter with kind of quarterend activity that you typically see john j greisch  president ceo  executive director it was probably more towards the end bob its hard to quantify it exactly but with our particularly pss business tending to be heavily backendloaded for the quarter it was more towards the end of the quarter robert a hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then i guess one of my sort of bigger picture questions here as it relates to europe and ous this isnt the first time that weve seen negative surprises in your international business and so im just trying to get a better understanding here is this your kind of a structural market demand issue or more of a hillromspecific execution surprise just help us understand kind of the bigger picture of whats going on in europe john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah i think your first comment bob was spot on it is frustrating to be close to firing on all cylinders and if you look at the two major challenges we have today ill bucket them in two different areas latin america middle east i feel we got great teams i feel we have the benefits of the strategic moves weve made starting to take hold asia clearly is taking hold but the capex squeeze in those regions on the back of oil and on the back of the economic disaster in latin america not much we can do about there europe the structural fundamental attractiveness of the pss business in europe is a challenging one were not going to invest to grow that business so were probably going to continue to see some top line reductions some macro driven from just the unattractiveness of the fundamentals of the market and some along the lines of what both carlyn and i mentioned in terms of shrinking to get better so i think carlyn hit the nail on the head there were some disruptions over the last six months of the organizational changes that we made the majority of those have impacted our european team and our european organization and id be naïve to sit here and say that did not have some impact on our european performance in pss this quarter whether it was half a third its not something that i can precisely identify but thats behind us i feel confident about that the underlying fundamentals are going to be continue to be challenging and rather than continue to try to figure out how are we going to grow in an unattractive market where the margins are not terribly attractive either i think were going to identify what size business can we profitably manage there and if that means shrinking it as i said by  million or thereabouts thats the approach were going to take strategically and redeploy our resources behind the welch allyn the respiratory care and some of the products that carlyn mentioned robert a hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch ex the  million is there a growth rate outside the united states youre comfortable talking about when you think about the company over the next couple of years john j greisch  president ceo  executive director id rather save that for our fourth quarter call bob once we make some of these moves i think we laid out in september a lowsingledigit growth for international if i remember correctly and i think thats realistic that could be improved somewhat but i dont want to get over our ski tips on that one until we actually make the moves that we want to make robert a hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks very much john j greisch  president ceo  executive director okay thanks for your question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of larry keusch from raymond james your line is now open lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc thanks good morning john switching gears back to north america and the pss business could you provide a little bit of color on so what segments of that business are doing well i know you mentioned icu but again if you could sort of help us understand a little bit of the complexion of what products are doing well and i know theres been some moves in the past between big refurbs at hospitals and replacements some color there would be helpful john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah ill let carlyn take the first crack at that larry thanks for the question carlyn d solomon  chief operating officer hey larry icu is doing well as john said and that really is driven by the best icu bed frame in the world offers a lot of advantages to the hospital and progressa and we continue to see very nice growth in that franchise and thats the franchise you want to be in because of the profitability of it because of the more clinical nature of it we also as we mentioned have seen very very nice growth out of our clinical workflow solutions business and this one we highlighted of course at the investor conference its growing very very nicely and to remind everybody this is what i would call a smart nurse call system and weve seen really nice growth out of that it links with our beds in the med surg space and so people have really appreciated some of the advantages that offers in terms of reducing falls risks in their hospital and so were seeing nice growth as we bring that value proposition to life for them weve seen nice growth in our rental business and particularly in some of the higherend stuff we offer we shared with you probably a year ago that we are launching compella which is far and away the best bed frame for obese patients and mostly people read that promise so thats driving a nice growth rate in our rental business weve also seen an uptick in our service offering so one of the things we put an emphasis on was growing our service offering we werent capturing as much of that opportunity as we felt we should we reallocated resources to it and were seeing a nice uptick with that and then the final thing i would mention its early days but we covered this at our investor conference we like a lot our addition to our icu space of metaneb and this is the noninvasive breathing procedure that you can go through that really helps patients and we link that with our icu offering so when you pull all that together were clicking in a lot of areas of this business and pleased with that john j greisch  president ceo  executive director hey larry just to add to that the investor angst over the volatility of the north american business and now the international pss business but the source of that angst and the source of that volatility historically has really been our med surg bed frame product category i think the really positive news and fact around our north american business while that has been – while the north american business has been growing around  pretty persistently here for the last six quarters to eight quarters our med surg business has actually been pretty flat so the products that carlyn just mentioned icu service clinical workflow solutions are patient handling lift products those are driving the growth so the really encouraging thing back to david romans first question about our confidence in north america is it hasnt been driven over last couple of years by massive growth in what has been historically the most volatile product category you look at international we dont have all those other products internationally because these are the price points dont make them attractive for us or in the case of our clinical workflow solutions business we havent introduced that internationally historically hence the volatility that were seeing today together with some of the organizational disruptions so as good as we feel about north americas growth rates i think its important for investors to understand that really hasnt been driven by the volatile products segment and i know a few months ago everybody is worried that were about to fall off the cliff with the growth in north america had that been driven by the more volatile product categories that risk probably wouldnt have more legitimacy associated with it but that hasnt been the case and i think as we look at the business we feel really good about the momentum in north america generally lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc very clear thank you for that and then just quickly on the free cash flow generation looks like still around ish million for the year just to remind us steve again on sort of how youre thinking about the capital allocation steven j strobel  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah i dont take too much in the way it changed there i mean our initial and first accountability and objective is deleveraging and weve taken debt down through the first half around  million and we continue to deploy our cash flow in that manner along with obviously growing the business internally and continue to look at if theres opportunistic small boltons and other investments that we can make to accelerate growth in some of the areas that carlyn and john have talked about well continue to look at those but first and foremost were focused on generating cash to take the appropriate measures and delever and hit our targets on that john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah larry until we have a few quarters under our belt where we are hitting on all cylinders dont expect us to do anything major on the ma side as steve said were going to continue to look and we may do a few little things but we got a lot on our plate internally at the moment lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc understood thank you very much john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt mishan of keybanc your line is now open matt mishan  keybanc capital markets inc hey good morning and thank you for taking my questions john j greisch  president ceo  executive director hi matt unknown speaker hi matt matt mishan  keybanc capital markets inc i guess the bigger surprise for me is the strength in welch allyn whats driving that mid to highsingledigit revenue growth for a business that was traditionally kind of like low single digits carlyn d solomon  chief operating officer yeah i think theres a number of things and boy its been a great acquisition for us so far as john said the integration has gone very smoothly we see nice growth in the us in vital signs they launched and weve launched a new product called the connex spot monitor thats really well received kind of across the us and around the world we also have some new technology thats starting to roll out a new product called retinavue which is just getting launched that were pretty excited about as well and then i think theres just an operational cadence and discipline that alton shader who is the president of welch allyn that we put in place there has driven and its really benefited them i think that welch allyn was a great brand but as a privately held company we definitely picked up the pace around some of what our expectations are some of the innovation were backing harder some of the products that are doing well in the market than maybe they would have been before and so i think you combine all that its been a really nice story john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah matt just one other quick thing to add you heard carlyn talk about redeploying resources two of our four regional leaders are from the welch allyn organization so thats a good example of redeploying senior talent in the company to drive growth in that part of the portfolio the international growth that we saw with welch allyn here in q of nearly  youre right its a heck of a lot stronger than it had been and i think a lot of it is driven by things carlyn said and the redeployment of resources behind what is a very high margin opportunity for us matt mishan  keybanc capital markets inc okay great thats helpful and then can you talk about the early expectations and indications around the trumpf integrated table motion and then i also believe its sold through your sales force nonintuitive are you guys going to be in there early or late in the sales cycle and does it enable you to cross sell other products john j greisch  president ceo  executive director yeah so first of all were excited about the technology matt and our customers are excited about it it seems to offer them a lot of advantages and surgical reduction surgical time and safety were still working through a lot of the details of how we sell this and how we work productively most productively with the intuitive surgical reps but all this starts with the placements and them selling an xi robot and them also selling up selling them to the software that would enable table motion and in some cases were seeing that the rep will introduce the table they obviously know they need the table but we definitely lag after that and sometimes its short depending on the relationship in the field sometimes its longer and well get in there later to sell the table so hence thats kind of the delay from what you might see from intuitive surgical to what youll see with us but we still anticipate its a big opportunity for us i think its going to take longer than maybe all of us wanted it to and what we even might have thought it would as follow in after the xi robot sold after the software is sold to get in with our table matt mishan  keybanc capital markets inc okay great thank you very much john j greisch  president ceo  executive director thanks matt operator thank you im showing no further questions at this time i would like to hand the call back over to management for your closing remarks john j greisch  president ceo  executive director okay thanks everybody for joining us and look forward to catching up with you at various conferences
