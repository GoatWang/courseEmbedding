carol karp md on new treatments in ocular surface tumors  ophthalmologyweb the ultimate online resource for ophthalmologists homecataractcorneaglaucomarefractiveretinapractice management welcome guest sign in register carol karp md on new treatments in ocular surface tumors tuesday january   tweet email carol l karp md describes the treatment of ocular surface tumors in an interview with david goldman md ocular surface tumors can be put into three categories pigmented nonpigmented and lymphomas ocular squamous neoplasias which used to be called cin  corneal and conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia is part of the spectrum of squamous cell carcinomas and are invasive whereas cin is full thickness or partial thickness of the epithelium only these tumors are almost always nonpigmented appearance varies papillary gelatinous leukoplakic opalescent if on cornea rose bengal staining is very helpful in differential diagnosis when there’s a breakdown of the mucin layer of the eye the keratin of the tumor stains it can also demonstrate the margins of the lesion the decision to perform surgery is based on size and surgical risk damage to limbus and complexity of reconstruction another factor is that some patients prefer surgery other options are medical treatments mitomycinc mmc fluorouracil fu or interferon ifn dr karp’s personal preference is for ifns because of their biology ifns are used systemically for leukemia and melanomas use in eye is offlabel can be used as drops and is well tolerated compounded at m iuml dosed qid for  months of treatment is generally efficacious subconjunctival injection is another option – no compliance issues each injection is m iu side effects of the subconjunctival ifn injection can cause a flulike malaise for the next  to  hrs injections are given once or twice a week mitomycinc is used in trabeculectomies and pterygium surgeries in this setting it is administered qid at either  or  punctal plugs used to protect lachrymal ducts used  to  days depending on how long the patient can stand the discomfort – epithelial toxicity once compounded the solution is stable for only about two weeks with refrigeration several rounds of this may be necessary it is effective but is really rough when compared to ifn fu also used in glaucoma surgery is another alkylating agent more stabile than mmc fu is used similarly qid for  to  days patrick yeatts md suggests using  days of treatment taking the rest of the month off then cycling again fu seems to be somewhat less effective but causes less toxicity than mmc if a patient is on ifn and reaches a plateau you could then try a course of mmc conversely a patient on mmc can be switched to ifn if mmc is poorly tolerated dr karp often does a biopsy at the slit lamp to confirm the diagnosis this is because not everything that looks like a cin is a cin could be an amelonotic melanoma or a sebaceous cell carcinoma so if you’re treating a patient clinically and there is little response to treatment it could be one of these other diseases dr karp then goes on to describe three cases in which successful resolution was demonstrated using mmc drops ifn injections and topical ifn ifn is used to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia this disease and conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia have a lot of parallels both are at transition zones between non keratinized epithelium langerhans cells immune vigilance and hpv  and  have a role in disease dr karp performs posttreatment biopsies on occasion to verify the absence of residual neoplastic cells  view
