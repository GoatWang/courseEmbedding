nirma institute of technology niraj shah blogs timeline skills contact birthday happy st birthday son friday december   th december  thursday me  my wife have never thought that this is the day which is going to change our life forever the day which turned out to be the most memorable day of our life i remember that morning when we visited the doctor and he happily surprised us by saying that “today is the day” i was feeling more fear than my wife but i was acting opposite  i still remember pace of my heart jumping like a fish in water when my wife was taken inside to do the honors however the situation was more tensed outside as if india vs pakistan cricket match reached to final over stage suddenly i heard a cute sound of crying inside yes the match was won a baby boy was born today the boy is turning  i always cherish the moment when i took him in my arms for very first time and i felt “complete” it has been the most lively year of my life most of our conversations have been nonverbal of course but trust me it’s the most beautiful ever  he makes me laugh when i’m sad he makes me feel special when i felt i’m not good enough he probably understands me more than anyone else every day i eagerly wait for the moment when i reach home and he runs towards me as soon as he sees me and that half or a minute of action is beyond words on his st birthday i would also like to thank my wife for giving me such precious gem thanks for bearing all the pain while you were pregnant thanks for sharing sleepless nights thanks for running to him when he cries thanks for being there with him whenever i can’t the world is definitely a good place to live in education has taken better approach freedom of speech has equal importance opportunities are infinite laughter is far often heard love exists relation matters and most importantly humanity is still alive i would not like to portray anything negative over here because life is full of positive things to focus into i wish every human being emphasizes more on ‘being human’ and so as my child on his very st birthday i promise to support him in every course of life i promise to give him better education i promise to provide him healthy  competitive environment to grow i promise to be a good father happy st birthday son featured a reservation dream saturday october    there is no caste in blood  edwin arnold and finally a weekend arrived it was a purposeful saturday morning the purpose was to spend quality time with family the plan was set a movie followed with a buffet lunch at city’s premium restaurant after waiting in queue at ticket window for long time i’ve got my turn to a bit of my surprise the person at the window asked me “what’s your caste sir” i didn’t get it at first i thought listening to boss’s loud lectures and customer’s rude complaints everyday has brought me a hearing problem so i modestly said “sorry i didn’t get you” he repeated “what’s your caste sir” this time i heard it right i thought that it might be a kind of survey by our government to see which caste views which actors’ movies the most so that it would be easier for them to give election tickets to those actors in next election i answered him he politely said “sorry sir we only have one ticket reserved for your caste” till the time i realize what he said i had been pushed out of the queue lately i understood what he said but had no clue ‘why’ being a middle class family we can’t afford to waste our time in thinking more about it as we rarely get such time to spend with family so we decided to continue with our plan and reached the premium restaurant we always wanted to visit and to all of our surprise the story repeated there was a separate waiting list for different castes and we’ve been asked to wait for at least couple of hours to get a table which is suitable to our caste i was upset i found it totally disgusting till the time we understand the whole disturbing situation i started hearing an alarm sound and to my great relief it was morning alarm what i saw was actually a dream an unwanted dream “we’ve got a reservation” a statement which is widely being used by reserved category people to refer their scope or rather rights of getting admission in education institutes however general category people use this to refer their either bus or train reservation reservation was introduced in the system at the time of era of untouchability when the difference between earnings of rich  poor people was too big and poor people were not able to grow or even survive due to low education the core intention was to provide equal rights to all however nowadays it is being used read misused here by all those who actually are in no need of this special service the time has changed in current trends being in reserved category is such a privilege that everybody wants to be there wealthy and forward people have no issue in being known as ‘backwards’ rather they would be more than happy if government allows them to be so reservation word has started sounding like us visa everybody wants it no matter how the saddest thing is this movement relatively affects the people who’re in actual need of this the constitution of country needs to be changed not by adding more castes in obcs but by thinking about disposal of the whole reservation system and if it still needs to be there then it should purely be based on poverty line and should not be based on castes each caste is producing doctors and engineers nowadays the castes which were backwards at the time of independence are very much wealthy nowadays moreover there is also a large pool of poor people in general category which neither gets an admission anywhere even though scoring high marks nor their families get any privileges nowadays where government is busy in promoting ‘skill india’ this diseased group of people is promoting ‘reservation india’ it’s the time to scrap the discrimination it’s the time to decide whether ‘no reservation’ or ‘reservation for only needy” otherwise we’re not far away from the dream i saw above when hospitals will also start taking admission based on castes petrol stations will also have a special queue for this low fuel people prices of vegetables will also be lower for them all lower berths in train compartments will be allocated to them indian cricket team will also have  scs  sts  obcs and  general for th man atm machine will start giving  rs when they request for  rs in which  rs will be deducted from our account and government will contribute the rest  rs and the most crucial one girls will only marry those ‘privileged’ boys lets stop preservation of reservation  about me hey im niraj shah welcome to my web world im an electronics engineer by education a delivery manager

cofounder niraj shah had to reorganize his  home goods websites by daniel wolfman contributing producer by chris beier chris beier has been creating videos for inc magazine since  chris became incs director of video development in  and now leads the creation and trajectory of all inc video series chris is a scorpio and wrote his own bio himself in third person director of video development  comments credit video transcript niraj shah cause you have to do it with this faith that in the end it was all worth it we had that faith but we were scared about the journeyin  niraj shah cofounded csn stores which sold home furnishings online at first the company had more than  websites each with a specific product niche shah we started the company in  shah and when we started the company in  these categories home goods were not thought of as great internet ecommerce categories who was gonna buy their furniture on line that type of thing in order to make it easier for customers to find what they were looking for we named the sites very clearly about what the category was so if you were looking for a bunk bed for your kids and you put the term bunk bed into google or what have you you find csn bunk beds you go to the site and you were like geez who knew there was a store that sold bunk beds they have  of them wow and so that strategy worked well to take these categories that were not obvious internet commerce categories and make them very accessible but we had one big problem which is customers would tell us they had a fantastic experience and then  of them would tell us that they didnt know we had  other web sites and we decided that was a big problem because if your loyal customers dont know about that well youre not gonna be able to get that repeat businessin  csn began to consider shutting down its niche sitesand redirecting customers to one main sitebut the plan came with risks shah the way we thought about this change we were convinced that the new site would be from a consumers standpoint what they really wanted what we were nervous about very nervous to be honest is the transition from this model that was working great to building up this new model its one of those things where you know youre gonna basically go off a cliff and youre gonna have to rebuild some of your momentum once you build it back up youre gonna be on a better trajectory then youve ever been on but that journey is going to be a bad one in terms of the near term consequences and we didnt know what that looked like we didnt know what that curve looked like because theres not very many companies who redirect sites at that traffic level to a new site so its generally viewed as a bad activity by google shah the math is if traffic goes down volume goes down if volume goes down all of a sudden as a company we employee  people and we have a certain fixed cost to operate and as volume goes down all of a sudden we went from making money we knew wed go to not making money thats scary right and for us we had not taken in outside capital so one of the things we did we decided to bring in investors and we said well lets bring in investors who believe in this strategy but lets put some money on the balance sheet because we know were gonna do something thats very risky but for this great outcome and so we did that and we did it because to be honest we had no idea what the numbers would look likeon september   csn stores consolidated almost all its websites into one wayfaircomthe companys overall traffic fell after the changebut grew through  surpassing what it had been shah the thing about change is it introduces uncertainty youre not sure whats gonna happen youre not sure that youre introducing risk and these are not things people generally want to do but i think if you dont change you run the risk of things actually changing against youto date wayfair has raised  million from batter ventures great hill partners spark capital and harbourvest partnersin
