jul   at  pm on saturday at our electric boat manufacturing facility in quonset point we celebrated the keel laying of the th virginiaclass submarine the oregon this is a shipbuilding tradition held to formally recognize the beginning of the construction process the ship’s sponsor mrs dana richardson declared the keel “well and truly laid” before state federal and us navy officialsalso invited were the  electric boat employees who work at quonset point building our nation’s nuclearpowered submarines submarine construction is a unique form of heavy manufacturing that is laborintensive and hightechnologybased our jobs provide good wages and benefits in a business essential to our national securityas with many manufacturers our labor force is aging with significant growth on the horizon electric boat will need to hire  new employees including  in skilled trades over the next decade to build the submarines the navy requiresin today’s environment however electric boat is challenged to hire the workers it needs our manufacturing work requires a high degree of skill many jobs require a security clearance our products are powered by nuclear reactors operating in the harshest environment on the planet so we are taking proactive steps to ensure we will have the workforce we require the lessons learned at electric boat can provide a blueprint for other employers and for potential partners in all levels of governmentpeople in our region want to work unfortunately not enough people have the necessary skills fortunately we have found strong partners across rhode island through gov gina raimondos real jobs rhode island program we have created partnerships that match jobtraining programs with electric boat’s needs resulting in wins for government industry and the community eb has strong consistent pipelines of talent and rhode island has more qualified people in the workforcewe have worked with our partners to better communicate the skills we require and the curricula that can provide those skills our partners identify learning institutions that can deliver our curriculawhile the public sector takes the lead to obtain grant funds we provide matching funds donationsinkind and commitments to hiring trainees electric boat mentors students and provides feedback on the performance of these new employeeswe are collaborating with the rhode island department of education to bring a nationally recognized shipbuilding curriculum into six high schools completion of which gives students a preference for job interviews at our company the first class from one of these schools recently graduated and all five graduates have jobs at electric boatnext year’s classes already have  students enrolled a significant increase over this year we expect even more students to sign up as they recognize the opportunity to learn career skills without incurring college costsanother publicprivate partnership has brought the westerly education center to life investments from the royce family foundation and electric boat coupled with support and leadership from the state has produced a school where people can learn or sharpen electrical sheetmetal and pipefitting skillsso far  eb quonset point employees have completed or are close to completing training in pipefitting and sheet metal work a mockup of a submarine’s hull at the facility enables trainees to practice their new skills in addition to receiving classroom instructionas we also have a significant presence in connecticut we have worked with leaders there to develop similar programs recognizing the regional nature of our economy leaders in connecticut and rhode island are working together to ensure that residents can participate in either state’s training programs this is a tremendous example of the way the public and private sectors can cooperate to put people to workthese powerful partnerships have demonstrated that it is critical that the public and private sectors work together governor raimondo and her team have demonstrated the leadership required job training provides the skills that employers need all participants invest including industryelectric boat’s manufacturing business is growing providing americans with the kind of good stable jobs that will help rebuild the middle class as our business grows so does our local economy in may unemployment in rhode island was at  percent below the national average and far lower than rhode island’s rate of more  percent in may to recruit the workforce american manufacturers need the public and private sectors must bring high schools colleges and community organizations into the effort based on our experience at electric boat we know such partnerships benefit everyone jeffrey s geiger is the
