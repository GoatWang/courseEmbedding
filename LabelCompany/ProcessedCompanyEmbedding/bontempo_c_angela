december   c angela bontempo president and ceo of saint vincent health system has officially announced her intent to retire effective december    her retirement was formally accepted at the saint vincent board of trustees meeting on tuesday november     the announcement came as no surprise to the sisters of st joseph or the saint vincent board of trustees as bontempo had indicated in early  she intended to retire by the end of   at that time the board initiated its succession planning process     according to tim shuttleworth chairman of the health system board of trustees the board has been engaged for nearly two years in a search and recruitment process to find the right person to succeed bontempo within her timeframe    when angela accepted the position at saint vincent in  she was very clear  she would bring to erie her absolute best  including vast and varied experiences in catholic healthcare  for about  years  and after that she would be looking forward to retirement said shuttleworth    when recruited in  bontempo became the first lay person to serve as president and ceo of saint vincent  eries first hospital and one of western pennsylvanias only remaining catholic hospitals    angela was the right person at the right time  her experience as a daughter of charity of st vincent depaul and her success as a healthcare administrator across the country made her the right fit for a catholic health system in transition shuttleworth explained  “angela has led this health system in an extraordinary way during what could be considered the most challenging of times  economically and for the healthcare industry overall  theres no doubt that saint vincent and the region have benefited from her vast experience    during her nine years as president and ceo saint vincent expanded facilities and services including the opening of the sister margaret ann hardner building expansion and renovation of the nicu and women’s center  she also guided the opening of the saint vincent imaging center endoscopy center urgent care west and childrens healthcare west  all at yorktown centre  and the start of another expansion project on the saint vincent campus that will enhance surgical and emergency services as well as provide stateoftheart energy for the hospital     under her watch saint vincent also saw extraordinary growth of its medical staff with the recruitment of more than  physicians in multiple specialties committed to serving erie and the surrounding region  bontempo also stepped in as ceo of westfield memorial hospital during a threeyear battle with the state of new york to keep the hospital open   among other accomplishments she made quality initiatives a top priority and established the first senior administrative position overseeing quality and medical informatics  as a result saint vincent has been recognized locally regionally and nationally for quality and service by organizations such as  healthgrades  rated  in the state for cardiac surgery premier award for quality ahamckesson quest for quality award jd power and associates solucient top  performance improvement leader thompson reuters  top  hospitals for performance improvement and cardiac benchmark for success highmark pay for performance award  scoring  in  health improvement projects     bontempos influence has also extended far beyond saint vincent through her leadership in professional organizations service on boards of many community organizations and membership in catholic healthcare organizations including pennsylvania catholic health care association board presently the chair hospital and healthcare association of pennsylvania board of directors diocese of erie finance council erie chamber and growth partnership united way of erie county board of directors vantage board of directors wny hospital association board of directors chautauqua county health network westfield memorial hospital board of trustees and mt bank corporation board of directors and chair of audit  risk committee     during the past decade she was also involved with american college of healthcare executives ache committees on membership and nomination as well as contributing to its seminars as a presenter   in her early tenure at saint vincent bontempo also published chapters and articles in both clinical and management journals and served on the governors committee for medical malpractice liability committee    angela was one of the best decisions the sisters ever made for saint vincent  there couldnt have been a better person to transition saint vincent from religious to lay leadership said sister ricarda vincent immediate past president of the sisters of st joseph  she not only understood but also embraced and propelled our mission to the next level  she stretched us  and thanks to angela saint vincent has an enhanced discipline in governance a senior vice president of mission integration a clear articulation of our core values and most important  a solid foundation to meet future challenges  especially those related to healthcare reform and the continuation of the sisters ministry she added   on behalf of the saint vincent board and administration shuttleworth commented angela will be missed not only at saint vincent but also among her colleagues in health care the organizations and advisory groups that have benefited from her counsel and especially in the community where she has been an articulate voice for economic development and the continued ministry of catholic healthcare particularly for the underserved    while bontempo will officially step down as president and ceo on december  she will remain as counsel to the administration for three to six months  the saint vincent board of trustees and the sisters of st joseph of northwestern pennsylvania have selected scott whalen phd to succeed angela as president and ceo of the health system effective jan    whalen currently serves as saint vincent health centers president and chief operating officer   c angela bontempo  boca raton fl  intelius sign in we found c angela bontempo in boca raton fl c angela bontempo intelius found that c
