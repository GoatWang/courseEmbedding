craxi stood in the  general election for the popular democratic front a political alliance between socialists and communists bettino campaigned for his father and later joined the italian socialist party at the age of  early political careeredit craxi during s in his first years as deputy craxi was precocious and ascended to many levels of public office at an early age meanwhile attended the faculty of law in university of milan and then the one of political science in urbino craxi founded the socialist university nucleus joining the new university group and adhering to the cudi italian democratic university centre the student group that supported the leftwing forces in this period he held the first public speaking organizing conferences debates film screenings and in  became part of the psi provincial committee in milan and leader of the socialist youth federation in  following the soviet invasion of hungary craxi with a group of loyalists committed himself to the detachment of the socialist party by the procommunist policy but he failed his proposed output of the socialist youth movement by the international organisation of democratic youth was rejected in november  he was elected town councilor in santangelo lodigiano birthplace of his mother from and in  he was elected to the central committee of the psi representing the autonomist current pietro nenni in  the party

pietro bucalossi in  with the formation of the unified socialist party a political alliance between the socialist party and the social democratic party craxi became provincial secretary of the psu in milan along with by the social democrat enrico rizzi and renzo peruzzotti in  general election craxi was elected for the first time at the chamber of deputies with  votes in the constituency of milan–pavia nel  after the end of the psu alliance craxi became vice secretary of the psi as proposed by giacomo mancini during this period he was a strong supporters of the organic centreleft coalition between the christian democrats of aldo moro and amintore fanfani the socialists of pietro nenni the social democrats of giuseppe saragat and the republicans of ugo la malfa in  with the reelection of francesco de martino as national secretary of the socialist party during the genoa congress craxi was confirmed with giovanni mosca in the role of deputy secretary receiving the commission to treat the international relations of the party as representative of psi at the socialist international craxi formed ties with some of the main european future leaders like willy brandt felipe gonzález françois mitterrand mario soares michel rocard and andreas papandreou as responsible of the psi foreign policy he supported also financially some socialist parties banned by the dictatorships of their respective countries including the spanish socialist workers party the panhellenic socialist movement and the chilean socialist party of salvador allende of whom craxi was a personal friend secretary of the socialist partyedit in  the secretary francesco de martino wrote an article in the socialist newspaper avanti that caused the fall of the government aldo moro and the subsequent snap election which saw an impressive growth of the italian communist party led by a young leader enrico berlinguer while the christian democracy managed to remain the majority party on just a few votes instead for the psi those elections were a crushing defeat the votes went down under the threshold of  de martino pointing to a new alliance with the communists was forced to resign and opened a serious crisis within the party craxi after the election as psi secretary in  bettino craxi was appointed to the vacant position of national secretary of the party ending years of factional fighting within the psi ironically the old guard saw him as shortlived leader allowing each faction time to regroup however he was able to consolidate power and implement his policies in particular he sought and managed to distance the party from the communists bringing it into an alliance with christian democracy and other centrist parties while maintaining a leftist and reformist profile craxi always opposed the historic compromise policy of moro and berlinguer a political alliance and an accommodation between the christian democrats and the communists the alliance would inevitably made it politically irrelevant the socialists he outlined for a line of alternation between the dc and the leftwing represented by his party due to the close relations between the pci and the soviet union on the morning of  march  the day on which the new cabinet led by giulio andreotti was supposed to have undergone a confidence vote in the italian parliament the car of aldo moro former prime minister and then president of dc was assaulted by a group of red brigades terrorists in via fani in rome firing automatic weapons the terrorists killed moros bodyguards and kidnapped him craxi was the only political leader together with amintore fanfani and marco pannella to declare himself available to a humanitarian solution that would allow the liberation of christian democrat statesman drawing heavy criticism on the socalled party of firmness primarily driven by the communists on  may  moros body was found in the trunk of a renault  in via caetani after  days of imprisonment during which moro was submitted to a political trial by the socalled peoples court set up by the brigate rosse and the italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners in  craxi decided to change the party logo of the party he chose a red carnation to represent the new course of the party in honour of the carnation revolution in portugal the party shrank the size of the old hammer and sickle in the lower part of the symbol it was eventually eliminated altogether in  craxi during a psi rally in july  following the resignation of president giovanni leone after a lengthy parliamentary battle craxi was able to bring together a large number of votes electing sandro pertini as new president pertini was the first socialist to hold this position pertini was also supported by the communists which considered the old socialist partisan not conducive to the new course of craxi craxi on the one hand explicitly distanced himself from leninism referring to forms of authoritarian socialism and on the other he showed supports to the civil society movements and to the battles for civil rights mainly proposed by the radical party he oversaw its image through the media as leader of psi he tried to undermine the communist party which until then had been continuously increasing its votes in elections and to consolidate the psi as a modern strongly proeuropean reformist socialdemocratic party with deep roots in the democratic leftwing this strategy called for ending most of the partys historical traditions as a workingclass trade union based party and attempting to gain new support among whitecollar and public sector employees at the same time the psi increased its presence in the big stateowned enterprises and became heavily involved in corruption and illegal party funding which would eventually result in the mani pulite investigations even if the psi never became a serious electoral challenger either to the pci or the christian democrats its pivotal position in the political arena allowed it to claim the post of prime minister for craxi after the  general election the electoral support for the christian democrats was significantly weakened leaving it with  of the vote compared to the  it gained in  the psi that had obtained only  threatened to leave the parliamentary majority unless craxi was made prime minister the christian democrats accepted this compromise to avoid a new election craxi became the first socialist in the history of the italian republic to be appointed prime minister prime minister of italyedit bettino craxi in  bettino craxi led the third longestlived government of italy during the republican era after the ii and iv silvio berlusconi cabinets and had strong influence in italian politics throughout the s for a time he was a close ally of two key figures of christian democracy giulio andreotti and arnaldo forlani in a loose crossparty alliance often dubbed caf from the first letter of the surname craxiandreottiforlani craxi had a firm grasp on a party previously troubled by factionalism and tried to distance it from the communists and to bring it closer to christian democrats and other parties his objective was to create an italian version of european reformist socialist parties like the german spd or the french socialist party the italian socialist party reached its postwar apex when it increased its share of votes in the general election of  however the italian socialist party never outgrew the much larger italian communist party whose highly charismatic leader enrico berlinguer was a fierce adversary of craxis policies through the years the main dynamic of italian postwar politics was to find a way to keep the italian communist party out of power this led to the constant formation of political alliances between parties keen on keeping the communists at bay things were further complicated by the fact that many parties had internal currents that would have welcomed the communists in the governing coalition in particular within christian democracy the largest party in italy from  until the end of the first republic domestic policyedit during craxis tenure as prime minister italy became the fifth largest industrial nation and gained entry into the g group of most industrialised nations however inflation was often in the double digits against trade union resistance the craxi government reacted by abolishing wageprice indexation a mechanism known as scala mobile or escalator under which wages had been increased automatically in line with inflation abolishing the escalator system did help reduce inflation which was also falling in other major countries but in the long term it inevitably increased industrial action as workers had to bargain for better salaries in any event the victory of the no campaign in the referendum called by the italian communist party was a major victory for craxi during his premiership the socialist party gained popularity he successfully boosted the countrys gnp and controlled inflation craxi with the christian democratic leader giulio andreotti in domestic policy a number of reforms were initiated during craxis time in office in  solidarity contracts worksharing arrangements to avoid redundancies were introduced while restrictions on parttime employment were relaxed in the field of family welfare legislation was enacted in  and  that changed the family allowance system “so that people most in need received larger amounts and coverage was progressively reduced to the point of termination once certain income levels were exceeded” as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era passing  of gross national product the level of public debt remains in excess of  of gdp today concordate with the vaticanedit in  craxi signed agreement with the vatican city that revised the lateran treaty among other things both sides declared the principle of the catholic religion as the sole religion of the italian state originally referred to by the lateran pacts shall be considered to be no longer in force the churchs position as the sole statesupported religion of italy was also ended replacing the state financing with a personal income tax called the otto per mille to which other religious groups christian and nonchristian also have access the revised concordat regulated the conditions under which civil effects are accorded to church marriages and to ecclesiastical declarations of nullity of marriages abolished articles included those concerning state recognition of knighthoods and titles of nobility conferred by the holy see the undertaking by the holy see to confer ecclesiastical honours on those authorized to perform religious functions at the request of the state or the royal household and the obligation of the holy see to enable the italian government to present political objections to the proposed appointment of diocesan bishops foreign policyedit craxi with the romanian president nicolae ceaușescu in the international arena craxi helped dissidents and socialist parties throughout the world to organise and become independent notable recipients of his logistical help were the spanish socialist workers party psoe during francisco francos dictatorship and dramatist jiři pelikan in the former czechoslovakia rare footage of craxi trying to lay flowers at the tomb of salvador allende has been unearthed from rais radiotelevisione italiana archives there is also evidence that part of craxis illegally earned money was given in secret to leftist political opposition in uruguay during the military dictatorship to solidarity in the period of jaruzelski rule in poland and to yasser arafat and his palestine liberation organization because of craxis sympathy for the palestinian cause he also played a role in the  seizure of power in tunisia by zine el abidine ben ali the sigonella crisisedit main article achille lauro hijacking internationally craxi is perhaps best remembered for an incident in october  when he refused the request of us president ronald reagan to extradite the hijackers of the cruise ship achille lauro after protracted negotiations the hijackers were given safe passage to egypt by plane three united states navy fs forced the plane down to the united states naval air facility naf of sigonella according to the version of political circles in washington craxi first gave the united states forces permission to detain the terrorists but he later reneged on the deal he ordered italian troops to surround the us forces protecting the plane craxi with the president of the united states ronald reagan this move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about terrorists targeting italy if the united states had had it their way and by the italian tradition of diplomacy with the arab world craxis decisive character may have been relevant in this resolution though the americans demanded that the italian authorities extradite abu abbas of the plo craxi stood firm on the grounds that the crime had been perpetrated on italian soil over which the italian republic had sole jurisdiction craxi rejected the us extradition order and let abu abbas – chief of the hijackers present on the plane – flee to yugoslavia the four hijackers were later found guilty and sentenced to prison terms for hijacking and the murder of a jewish american citizen leon klinghoffer abbas was later also convicted in italy in absentia and eventually died of natural causes shortly after being taken prisoner by american forces in the aftermath of the  invasion of iraq this episode earned craxi an article in the economist titled europes strong man and a standing ovation in the senate of the republic which included his communist opponents us attack on libyaedit according to giulio andreotti italys foreign minister at the time and nd prime minister of italy and abdel rahman shalgham libyas foreign minister from  until  craxi was the person who telephoned libyan leader muammar algaddafi to warn him of the impending american operation el dorado canyon retaliatory airstrikes against libya on  april  this permitted gaddafi and his family to evacuate their residence in the bab alazizia compound moments before the bombs dropped shalghams statement was also confirmed by margherita boniver foreign affairs chief of craxis socialist party at the time for the libyan attack craxis government denied the united states any rights of military overflight as did france and spain for the united states this precluded the use of european continental bases forcing the us air force component to be flown around france and spain over portugal and through the straits of gibraltar adding  miles  km each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings resignationedit in april  the secretary of the christian democracy ciriaco de mita decided not to support more craxis government this caused the immediate fall of the cabinet and the formation of a new government led by the longtime christian democratic politician amintore fanfani even though fanfani was a close friend and ally of craxi he did not participate in the swearing in ceremony sending the undersecretary to the presidency of the council giuliano amato after the premiershipedit in the  general election the psi won  of the vote a good result but less good than what craxi hoped and this time it was the christian democrats turn to govern from  to  the psi participated in four governments allowing giulio andreotti to take power in  and to govern until  the socialists held a strong balance of power which made them more powerful than the christian democrats who had to depend on it to form a majority in parliament the psi kept tight control of this advantage the alternative which craxi had wanted so much was taking shape the idea of a social unity with the other leftwing political parties including the pci proposed by craxi in  after the fall of communism he believed that the collapse of communism in eastern europe had undermined the pci and made social unity inevitable in fact the psi was in line to become the italys second largest party and to become the dominant force of a new leftwing coalition opposed to a christian democratled one this did not actually happen because of the rise of lega nord and the tangentopoli scandals involvement in tangentopoli scandaledit main article mani pulite craxi greeted by a salvo of coins as a sign of loathing by protesters the last main turning point of craxis career began in february  when socialist mp mario chiesa was arrested by police while taking a  million lira bribe from a cleaning service firm chiesa sought craxis protection for nearly a month but craxi accused him of casting a shadow on the most honest party in italy feeling marginalised and unjustly singledout chiesa divulged everything he knew to the prosecutors his revelations brought half of the milan socialists and industrialists under investigation even paolo pillitteri craxis own brotherinlaw and mayor of milan was investigated despite his parliamentary immunity as a consequence a team of milanese judges began investigating specifically the partys financing system in july  craxi finally realised the situation was serious and that he himself was going to be hit by the unfolding scandal he made an appeal before the chamber of deputies in which he claimed that everyone knew of the widespread irreguralities in the public financing of italian parties accused the deputies of hypocrisy and cowardice and called for all mps to protect the socialists from prosecution as a show of solidarity however his call was ignored craxi received his first prosecution notice in december  more followed in january and february at which point the court of milan explicitly asked parliament to authorise craxis prosecution for bribery and corruption at the time italian mps were immune from prosecution unless authorised by parliament the authorisation was denied on  april  after craxi gave an emotional speech however upon coming out of the roman raphael hotel where he lived received a salvo of coins that members coming from democratic party of the left rally and the rightists italian social movement in piazza navona threw to him as a sign of their disgust they started to jump and sing he who does not jump is a socialist from a traditional stadium chant some of the students waved lire bills singing bettino do you want these too bettino vuoi pure queste to the tune of guantanamera facing the judgesedit in december  after his prosecution was finally authorised craxi was called to testify alongside democrazia cristiana party secretary arnaldo forlani before justice antonio di pietro questions were asked about the socalled enimont superbribe which the psi and dc had jointly received and democratically shared forlani evasively asked what a bribe was while craxi after admitting to the charges brought against himself and other parties stated that the bribes were the cost of politics craxi noting that the legal process had accelerated in his case claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated in may  he fled to tunis in order to escape jail his political career ended in less than two years italys entire political class including people like andreotti and forlani was to follow suit soon the caf the craxiandreottiforlani axis which had made a pact to revive the pentapartito an alliance of five parties dc psi italian republican party italian liberal party italian democratic socialist party of the s and apply it to the s was doomed to be crushed by the popular vote as well as by the judges antonio di pietro led the mani pulite investigation team the set of anticorruption investigations carried out by the milan judges came to be collectively called mani pulite clean hands no party was spared but in some parties corruption had become more endemic than elsewhere either because of more opportunity or internal ethics to this day some people especially those who were close to craxi argue that some parties such as the italian communist party were left untouched while the leaders of then ruling coalition and in particular bettino craxi were wiped off the political map the judges in milan were put under scrutiny several times by different governments especially silvio berlusconis first government in  but no evidence of any misconduct was ever found furthermore public opinion was much less concerned about foreign financing than about the misappropriation of their money by corrupt politicians in the end the socialist party went from  of the vote to a virtual nil an ironic note was that the disgraced remnant of the party was excluded from parliament by the minimum  threshold introduced by bettino craxi himself during one of his previous governments as mentioned before during the mani pulite period craxi tried to use a daring defence tactic he maintained that all parties needed and took money illegally however they could get it to finance their activities his defence was therefore not to declare himself innocent but everybody guilty while this was basically the truth most citizens distrusted politicians and craxis defence got no sympathy by the citizens and may have even served to enrage them further it should be noted besides that some bribes didnt go to the parties at all they went to the personal wallets of the politician who happened to take them in  di pietro admitted that craxi was right when during the process enimont he accused italian communist party to have received illegal funding from the soviet union craxis sentences seemed to him criminally relevant but di pietro omitted to investigate that crime critics to his lifestyleedit craxis lifestyle was perceived to be inappropriate for the secretary of a party with so many alleged financial problems he lived in the raphael an expensive hotel in romes centre and had a large villa in hammamet tunisia as the mani pulite investigations were to uncover in the s personal corruption was endemic in italian society while many politicians including craxi would justify corruption with the necessities of a democracy political leaders at many levels enjoyed a lifestyle that should have been well out of their reach while most parties continued having financial problems rino formica a prominent member of the socialist party in those years wittily said that the convent is poor but the friars are rich furthermore craxis arrogant character won him many enemies one of his most condemned actions was blaming corruption in the socialist party on treasurer vincenzo balzamo just after the latters death in order to clear himself of any accusation he also had controversial friends such as siad barre dictator of somalia yasser arafat leader of plo and ben ali dictator of tunisia the latter provided protection to craxi when he escaped from italy craxis entourage was famously criticised by formica as a court of midgets and dancers corte di nani e ballerine indicating the often ludicrous and immoral traits of a system based on personal acquaintance rather than merit among the friends of craxis to receive smaller and larger favours silvio berlusconi is perhaps the most known he received many favours especially regarding his media empire and had a decree named after him decreto berlusconi long before he entered politics other figures were craxis mistresses ania pieroni who owned a tv station in the rome area and sandra milo who had a skyrocketing career in the stateowned tv channels rai craxi was also known for never apologising as a matter of principle most italians expected an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed craxi never apologised stating he had done nothing that everybody else had not been doing and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted judgements of european court of human rightsedit all three appeals by craxi to strasbourg court complained that his defense was not able to refute in court the accusations made by various defendants of related crimes in violation of the adversarial principle proclaimed in article  paragraph  letter d of the european convention of human rights by the way just once the european court ruled in his favour in a case of wiretapped conversations illegally made public decline and dissolution of the socialist partyedit bettino craxi resigned as party secretary in february  between  and  most members of the party left politics and three socialist deputies committed suicide craxi was succeeded by two socialist tradeunionists first giorgio benvenuto and then by ottaviano del turco in the december  provincial and municipal elections the psi was virtually wiped out receiving around  of the vote in milan where the psi had won  in  the psi received a mere  which was not even enough to elect a councillor del turco tried in vain to regain credibility for the party in the  general election what was left of psi allied itself to the alliance of progressives dominated by the postcommunist incarnation of the pci the democratic party of the left pds del turco had quickly changed the party symbol to reinforce the idea of innovation however this did not stop the psi gaining only  of the votes compared to  in  the psi got  deputies and  senators elected down from  deputies and  senators of  most of them came from the leftwing of the party as del turco himself did most socialists joined other political forces mainly forza italia the new party led by silvio berlusconi the patto segni and democratic alliance the party was disbanded on  november  after two years of agony in which almost all of its longtime leaders especially bettino craxi were involved in tangentopoli and decided to leave politics the yearold party closed down partially thanks to its leaders for their personalisation of the psi craxismedit main article craxism bettino craxi during s craxism ita craxismo was and is according to some extant an italian political ideology based on craxis thought it was informal ideology of the socialist party from  to  origins and featuresedit the craxism although the term derogatory today was based on a synthesis of social democracy socialism and social liberalism in fact if on one side the psi under craxi is required with a strong thirdworldism proarabianism environmentalism and a modern welfare state system typical of the modern left on the other hand was strongly proatlanticist and proeuropeanist and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty eg sigonella crisis american armed forces and on conservative policies on issues such as abortion and war on drugs under craxi psi moved from leftwing to centreleft much to ally with the christian democracy and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called pentapartito which ensured a stable majority to govern criticsedit today the craxism is often used in derogatory form to define a corrupt politician although some welcome him in a favourable manner this is the case of those who following the dissolution of the psi joined the newly formed forza italia of silvio berlusconi centreright but also a part of those who formed the italian socialists small party adhering to the alliance of progressives of achille occhetto centreleft finally the craxism has led to the change of the entire european socialism together with felipe gonzález psoe françois mitterrand ps and helmut schmidt spd during all the years  in addition along with these other figures inspired the overhaul and the policies of tony blairs labour party the josé zapateros psoe and the andreas papandreous pasok in italy the main critics of the craxism as well as the figure of craxi are the former communists including most members of the democratic party and some media leftwing press il fatto quotidiano il manifesto lespresso la repubblica etc while the biggest supporters are the psi of riccardo nencini and various politicians of the people of freedom and the centreright as silvio berlusconi also exsocialist renato brunetta maurizio sacconi stefano caldoro and stefania craxi bettinos daughter death and legacyedit escape to tunisia and deathedit craxis grave in hammamet tunisia all this resulted in him being considered the symbol of political corruption bettino craxi escaped the laws he had once contributed to make by fleeing to hammamet tunisia in  and remained a fugitive there protected by ben alis government who was a personal friend of craxi he repeatedly declared himself innocent but never returned to italy where he had been sentenced to  years in jail because of his corruption crimes of these  years and  months were upheld on appeal craxi died on  january  at the age of  from complications of diabetes the then prime minister of and democrats of the left leader massimo dalema proposed a state funeral but his proposal was not accepted by craxis own family who accused the then government of preventing the craxi to return to italy to undergo a delicate surgery at the san raffaele hospital in milan craxis funerals took place at the cathedral of tunis and saw a large participation of the indigenous population former psi militants and other italians arrived in tunisia to make the last greetings to their leaders his supporters came outside the tunisian cathedral and targeted by insults and a launch of coins the representatives of the italian government lamberto dini and marco minniti craxis tomb

a step by start the seminary vittorio craxi stood in the  general election for the popular democratic front a political alliance between socialists and communists bettino campaigned for his father and later joined the italian socialist party at the age of  early political careeredit craxi during s in his first years as deputy craxi was precocious and ascended to many levels of public office at an early age meanwhile attended the faculty of law in university of milan and then the one of political science in urbino craxi founded the socialist university nucleus joining the new university group and adhering to the cudi italian democratic university centre the student group that supported the leftwing forces in this period he held the first public speaking organizing conferences debates film screenings and in  became part of the psi provincial committee in milan and leader of the socialist youth federation in  following the soviet invasion of hungary craxi with a group of loyalists

became assessor in the junta of gino cassinis in  he was excluded from the central committee of the socialist party by the new secretary francesco de martino in  he was appointed leader of the milan

for charity and assistance in the council of pietro bucalossi in  with the formation of the unified socialist party a political alliance between the socialist party and the social democratic party craxi became provincial secretary of the psu in milan along with by the social democrat enrico rizzi and renzo peruzzotti in  general election craxi was elected for the first time at the chamber of deputies with  votes in the constituency of milan–pavia nel  after the end of the psu alliance craxi became vice secretary of the psi as proposed by giacomo mancini during this period he was a strong supporters of the organic centreleft coalition between the christian democrats of aldo moro and amintore fanfani the socialists of pietro nenni the social democrats of giuseppe saragat and the republicans of ugo la malfa in  with the reelection of francesco de martino as national secretary of the socialist party during the genoa congress craxi was confirmed with giovanni mosca in the role of deputy secretary receiving the commission to treat the international relations of the party as representative of psi at the socialist international craxi formed ties with some of the main european future leaders like willy brandt felipe gonzález françois mitterrand mario soares michel rocard and andreas papandreou as responsible of the psi foreign policy he supported also financially some socialist parties banned by the dictatorships of their respective countries including the spanish socialist workers party the panhellenic socialist movement and the chilean socialist party of salvador allende of whom craxi was a personal friend secretary of the socialist partyedit in  the secretary francesco de martino wrote an article in the socialist newspaper avanti that caused the fall of the government aldo moro and the subsequent snap election which saw an impressive growth of the italian communist party led by a young leader enrico berlinguer while the christian democracy managed to remain the majority party on just a few votes instead for the psi those elections were a crushing defeat the votes went down under the threshold of  de martino pointing to a new alliance with the communists was forced to resign and opened a serious crisis within the party craxi after the election as psi secretary in  bettino craxi was appointed to the vacant position of national secretary of the party ending years of factional fighting within the psi ironically the old guard saw him as shortlived leader allowing each faction time to regroup however he was able to consolidate power and implement his policies in particular he sought and managed to distance the party from the communists bringing it into an alliance with christian democracy and other centrist parties while maintaining a leftist and reformist profile craxi always opposed the historic compromise policy of moro and berlinguer a political alliance and an accommodation between the christian democrats and the communists the alliance would inevitably made it politically irrelevant the socialists he outlined for a line of alternation between the dc and the leftwing represented by his party due to the close relations between the pci and the soviet union on the morning of  march  the day on which the new cabinet led by giulio andreotti was supposed to have undergone a confidence vote in the italian parliament the car of aldo moro former prime minister and then president of dc was assaulted by a group of red brigades terrorists in via fani in rome firing automatic weapons the terrorists killed moros bodyguards and kidnapped him craxi was the only political leader together with amintore fanfani and marco pannella to declare himself available to a humanitarian solution that would allow the liberation of christian democrat statesman drawing heavy criticism on the socalled party of firmness primarily driven by the communists on  may  moros body was found in the trunk of a renault  in via caetani after  days of imprisonment during which moro was submitted to a political trial by the socalled peoples court set up by the brigate rosse and the italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners in  craxi decided to change the party logo of the party he chose a red carnation to represent the new course of the party in honour of the carnation revolution in portugal the party shrank the size of the old hammer and sickle in the lower part of the symbol it was eventually eliminated altogether in  craxi during a psi rally in july  following the resignation of president giovanni leone after a lengthy parliamentary battle craxi was able to bring together a large number of votes electing sandro pertini as new president pertini was the first socialist to hold this position pertini was also supported by the communists which considered the old socialist partisan not conducive to the new course of craxi craxi on the one hand explicitly distanced himself from leninism referring to forms of authoritarian socialism and on the other he showed supports to the civil society movements and to the battles for civil rights mainly proposed by the radical party he oversaw its image through the media as leader of psi he tried to undermine the communist party which until then had been continuously increasing its votes in elections and to consolidate the psi as a modern strongly proeuropean reformist socialdemocratic party with deep roots in the democratic leftwing this strategy called for ending most of the partys historical traditions as a workingclass trade union based party and attempting to gain new support among whitecollar and public sector employees at the same time the psi increased its presence in the big stateowned enterprises and became heavily involved in corruption and illegal party funding which would eventually result in the mani pulite investigations even if the psi never became a serious electoral challenger either to the pci or the christian democrats its pivotal position in the political arena allowed it to claim the post of prime minister for craxi after the  general election the electoral support for the christian democrats was significantly weakened leaving it with  of the vote compared to the  it gained in  the psi that had obtained only  threatened to leave the parliamentary majority unless craxi was made prime minister the christian democrats accepted this compromise to avoid a new election craxi became the first socialist in the history of the italian republic to be appointed prime minister prime minister of italyedit bettino craxi in  bettino craxi led the third longestlived government of italy during the republican era after the ii and iv silvio berlusconi cabinets and had strong influence in italian politics throughout the s for a time he was a close ally of two key figures of christian democracy giulio andreotti and arnaldo forlani in a loose crossparty alliance often dubbed caf from the first letter of the surname craxiandreottiforlani craxi had a firm grasp on a party previously troubled by factionalism and tried to distance it from the communists and to bring it closer to christian democrats and other parties his objective was to create an italian version of european reformist socialist parties like the german spd or the french socialist party the italian socialist party reached its postwar apex when it increased its share of votes in the general election of  however the italian socialist party never outgrew the much larger italian communist party whose highly charismatic leader enrico berlinguer was a fierce adversary of craxis policies through the years the main dynamic of italian postwar politics was to find a way to keep the italian communist party out of power this led to the constant formation of political alliances between parties keen on keeping the communists at bay things were further complicated by the fact that many parties had internal currents that would have welcomed the communists in the governing coalition in particular within christian democracy the largest party in italy from  until the end of the first republic domestic policyedit during craxis tenure as prime minister italy became the fifth largest industrial nation and gained entry into the g group of most industrialised nations however inflation was often in the double digits against trade union resistance the craxi government reacted by abolishing wageprice indexation a mechanism known as scala mobile or escalator under which wages had been increased automatically in line with inflation abolishing the escalator system did help reduce inflation which was also falling in other major countries but in the long term it inevitably increased industrial action as workers had to bargain for better salaries in any event the victory of the no campaign in the referendum called by the italian communist party was a major victory for craxi during his premiership the socialist party gained popularity he successfully boosted the countrys gnp and controlled inflation craxi with the christian democratic leader giulio andreotti in domestic policy a number of reforms were initiated during craxis time in office in  solidarity contracts worksharing arrangements to avoid redundancies were introduced while restrictions on parttime employment were relaxed in the field of family welfare legislation was enacted in  and  that changed the family allowance system “so that people most in need received larger amounts and coverage was progressively reduced to the point of termination once certain income levels were exceeded” as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era passing  of gross national product the level of public debt remains in excess of  of gdp today concordate with the vaticanedit in  craxi signed agreement with the vatican city that revised the lateran treaty among other things both sides declared the principle of the catholic religion as the sole religion of the italian state originally referred to by the lateran pacts shall be considered to be no longer in force the churchs position as the sole statesupported religion of italy was also ended replacing the state financing with a personal income tax called the otto per mille to which other religious groups christian and nonchristian also have access the revised concordat regulated the conditions under which civil effects are accorded to church marriages and to ecclesiastical declarations of nullity of marriages abolished articles included those concerning state recognition of knighthoods and titles of nobility conferred by the holy see the undertaking by the holy see to confer ecclesiastical honours on those authorized to perform religious functions at the request of the state or the royal household and the obligation of the holy see to enable the italian government to present political objections to the proposed appointment of diocesan bishops foreign policyedit craxi with the romanian president nicolae ceaușescu in the international arena craxi helped dissidents and socialist parties throughout the world to organise and become independent notable recipients of his logistical help were the spanish socialist workers party psoe during francisco francos dictatorship and dramatist jiři pelikan in the former czechoslovakia rare footage of craxi trying to lay flowers at the tomb of salvador allende has been unearthed from rais radiotelevisione italiana archives there is also evidence that part of craxis illegally earned money was given in secret to leftist political opposition in uruguay during the military dictatorship to solidarity in the period of jaruzelski rule in poland and to yasser arafat and his palestine liberation organization because of craxis sympathy for the palestinian cause he also played a role in the  seizure of power in tunisia by zine el abidine ben ali the sigonella crisisedit main article achille lauro hijacking internationally craxi is perhaps best remembered for an incident in october  when he refused the request of us president ronald reagan to extradite the hijackers of the cruise ship achille lauro after protracted negotiations the hijackers were given safe passage to egypt by plane three united states navy fs forced the plane down to the united states naval air facility naf of sigonella according to the version of political circles in washington craxi first gave the united states forces permission to detain the terrorists but he later reneged on the deal he ordered italian troops to surround the us forces protecting the plane craxi with the president of the united states ronald reagan this move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about terrorists targeting italy if the united states had had it their way and by the italian tradition of diplomacy with the arab world craxis decisive character may have been relevant in this resolution though the americans demanded that the italian authorities extradite abu abbas of the plo craxi stood firm on the grounds that the crime had been perpetrated on italian soil over which the italian republic had sole jurisdiction craxi rejected the us extradition order and let abu abbas – chief of the hijackers present on the plane – flee to yugoslavia the four hijackers were later found guilty and sentenced to prison terms for hijacking and the murder of a jewish american citizen leon klinghoffer abbas was later also convicted in italy in absentia and eventually died of natural causes shortly after being taken prisoner by american forces in the aftermath of the  invasion of iraq this episode earned craxi an article in the economist titled europes strong man and a standing ovation in the senate of the republic which included his communist opponents us attack on libyaedit according to giulio andreotti italys foreign minister at the time and nd prime minister of italy and abdel rahman shalgham libyas foreign minister from  until  craxi was the person who telephoned libyan leader muammar algaddafi to warn him of the impending american operation el dorado canyon retaliatory airstrikes against libya on  april  this permitted gaddafi and his family to evacuate their residence in the bab alazizia compound moments before the bombs dropped shalghams statement was also confirmed by margherita boniver foreign affairs chief of craxis socialist party at the time for the libyan attack craxis government denied the united states any rights of military overflight as did france and spain for the united states this precluded the use of european continental bases forcing the us air force component to be flown around france and spain over portugal and through the straits of gibraltar adding  miles  km each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings resignationedit in april  the secretary of the christian democracy ciriaco de mita decided not to support more craxis government this caused the immediate fall of the cabinet and the formation of a new government led by the longtime christian democratic politician amintore fanfani even though fanfani was a close friend and ally of craxi he did not participate in the swearing in ceremony sending the undersecretary to the presidency of the council giuliano amato after the premiershipedit in the  general election the psi won  of the vote a good result but less good than what craxi hoped and this time it was the christian democrats turn to govern from  to  the psi participated in four governments allowing giulio andreotti to take power in  and to govern until  the socialists held a strong balance of power which made them more powerful than the christian democrats who had to depend on it to form a majority in parliament the psi kept tight control of this advantage the alternative which craxi had wanted so much was taking shape the idea of a social unity with the other leftwing political parties including the pci proposed by craxi in  after the fall of communism he believed that the collapse of communism in eastern europe had undermined the pci and made social unity inevitable in fact the psi was in line to become the italys second largest party and to become the dominant force of a new leftwing coalition opposed to a christian democratled one this did not actually happen because of the rise of lega nord and the tangentopoli scandals involvement in tangentopoli scandaledit main article mani pulite craxi greeted by a salvo of coins as a sign of loathing by protesters the last main turning point of craxis career began in february  when socialist mp mario chiesa was arrested by police while taking a  million lira bribe from a cleaning service firm chiesa sought craxis protection for nearly a month but craxi accused him of casting a shadow on the most honest party in italy feeling marginalised and unjustly singledout chiesa divulged everything he knew to the prosecutors his revelations brought half of the milan socialists and industrialists under investigation even paolo pillitteri craxis own brotherinlaw and mayor of milan was investigated despite his parliamentary immunity as a consequence a team of milanese judges began investigating specifically the partys financing system in july  craxi finally realised the situation was serious and that he himself was going to be hit by the unfolding scandal he made an appeal before the chamber of deputies in which he claimed that everyone knew of the widespread irreguralities in the public financing of italian parties accused the deputies of hypocrisy and cowardice and called for all mps to protect the socialists from prosecution as a show of solidarity however his call was ignored craxi received his first prosecution notice in december  more followed in january and february at which point the court of milan explicitly asked parliament to authorise craxis prosecution for bribery and corruption at the time italian mps were immune from prosecution unless authorised by parliament the authorisation was denied on  april  after craxi gave an emotional speech however upon coming out of the roman raphael hotel where he lived received a salvo of coins that members coming from democratic party of the left rally and the rightists italian social movement in piazza navona threw to him as a sign of their disgust they started to jump and sing he who does not jump is a socialist from a traditional stadium chant some of the students waved lire bills singing bettino do you want these too bettino vuoi pure queste to the tune of guantanamera facing the judgesedit in december  after his prosecution was finally authorised craxi was called to testify alongside democrazia cristiana party secretary arnaldo forlani before justice antonio di pietro questions were asked about the socalled enimont superbribe which the psi and dc had jointly received and democratically shared forlani evasively asked what a bribe was while craxi after admitting to the charges brought against himself and other parties stated that the bribes were the cost of politics craxi noting that the legal process had accelerated in his case claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated in may  he fled to tunis in order to escape jail his political career ended in less than two years italys entire political class including people like andreotti and forlani was to follow suit soon the caf the craxiandreottiforlani axis which had made a pact to revive the pentapartito an alliance of five parties dc psi italian republican party italian liberal party italian democratic socialist party of the s and apply it to the s was doomed to be crushed by the popular vote as well as by the judges antonio di pietro led the mani pulite investigation team the set of anticorruption investigations carried out by the milan judges came to be collectively called mani pulite clean hands no party was spared but in some parties corruption had become more endemic than elsewhere either because of more opportunity or internal ethics to this day some people especially those who were close to craxi argue that some parties such as the italian communist party were left untouched while the leaders of then ruling coalition and in particular bettino craxi were wiped off the political map the judges in milan were put under scrutiny several times by different governments especially silvio berlusconis first government in  but no evidence of any misconduct was ever found furthermore public opinion was much less concerned about foreign financing than about the misappropriation of their money by corrupt politicians in the end the socialist party went from  of the vote to a virtual nil an ironic note was that the disgraced remnant of the party was excluded from parliament by the minimum  threshold introduced by bettino craxi himself during one of his previous governments as mentioned before during the mani pulite period craxi tried to use a daring defence tactic he maintained that all parties needed and took money illegally however they could get it to finance their activities his defence was therefore not to declare himself innocent but everybody guilty while this was basically the truth most citizens distrusted politicians and craxis defence got no sympathy by the citizens and may have even served to enrage them further it should be noted besides that some bribes didnt go to the parties at all they went to the personal wallets of the politician who happened to take them in  di pietro admitted that craxi was right when during the process enimont he accused italian communist party to have received illegal funding from the soviet union craxis sentences seemed to him criminally relevant but di pietro omitted to investigate that crime critics to his lifestyleedit craxis lifestyle was perceived to be inappropriate for the secretary of a party with so many alleged financial problems he lived in the raphael an expensive hotel in romes centre and had a large villa in hammamet tunisia as the mani pulite investigations were to uncover in the s personal corruption was endemic in italian society while many politicians including craxi would justify corruption with the necessities of a democracy political leaders at many levels enjoyed a lifestyle that should have been well out of their reach while most parties continued having financial problems rino formica a prominent member of the socialist party in those years wittily said that the convent is poor but the friars are rich furthermore craxis arrogant character won him many enemies one of his most condemned actions was blaming corruption in the socialist party on treasurer vincenzo balzamo just after the latters death in order to clear himself of any accusation he also had controversial friends such as siad barre dictator of somalia yasser arafat leader of plo and ben ali dictator of tunisia the latter provided protection to craxi when he escaped from italy craxis entourage was famously criticised by formica as a court of midgets and dancers corte di nani e ballerine indicating the often ludicrous and immoral traits of a system based on personal acquaintance rather than merit among the friends of craxis to receive smaller and larger favours silvio berlusconi is perhaps the most known he received many favours especially regarding his media empire and had a decree named after him decreto berlusconi long before he entered politics other figures were craxis mistresses ania pieroni who owned a tv station in the rome area and sandra milo who had a skyrocketing career in the stateowned tv channels rai craxi was also known for never apologising as a matter of principle most italians expected an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed craxi never apologised stating he had done nothing that everybody else had not been doing and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted judgements of european court of human rightsedit all three appeals by craxi to strasbourg court complained that his defense was not able to refute in court the accusations made by various defendants of related crimes in violation of the adversarial principle proclaimed in article  paragraph  letter d of the european convention of human rights by the way just once the european court ruled in his favour in a case of wiretapped conversations illegally made public decline and dissolution of the socialist partyedit bettino craxi resigned as party secretary in february  between  and  most members of the party left politics and three socialist deputies committed suicide craxi was succeeded by two socialist tradeunionists first giorgio benvenuto and then by ottaviano del turco in the december  provincial and municipal elections the psi was virtually wiped out receiving around  of the vote in milan where the psi had won  in  the psi received a mere  which was not even enough to elect a councillor del turco tried in vain to regain credibility for the party in the  general election what was left of psi allied itself to the alliance of progressives dominated by the postcommunist incarnation of the pci the democratic party of the left pds del turco had quickly changed the party symbol to reinforce the idea of innovation however this did not stop the psi gaining only  of the votes compared to  in  the psi got  deputies and  senators elected down from  deputies and  senators of  most of them came from the leftwing of the party as del turco himself did most socialists joined other political forces mainly forza italia the new party led by silvio berlusconi the patto segni and democratic alliance the party was disbanded on  november  after two years of agony in which almost all of its longtime leaders especially bettino craxi were involved in tangentopoli and decided to leave politics the yearold party closed down partially thanks to its leaders for their personalisation of the psi craxismedit main article craxism bettino craxi during s craxism ita craxismo was and is according to some extant an italian political ideology based on craxis thought it was informal ideology of the socialist party from  to  origins and featuresedit the craxism although the term derogatory today was based on a synthesis of social democracy socialism and social liberalism in fact if on one side the psi under craxi is required with a strong thirdworldism proarabianism environmentalism and a modern welfare state system typical of the modern left on the other hand was strongly proatlanticist and proeuropeanist and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty eg sigonella crisis american armed forces and on conservative policies on issues such as abortion and war on drugs under craxi psi moved from leftwing to centreleft much to ally with the christian democracy and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called pentapartito which ensured a stable majority to govern criticsedit today the craxism is often used in derogatory form to define a corrupt politician although some welcome him in a favourable manner this is the case of those who following the dissolution of the psi joined the newly formed forza italia of silvio berlusconi centreright but also a part of those who formed the italian socialists small party adhering to the alliance of progressives of achille occhetto centreleft finally the craxism has led to the change of the entire european socialism together with felipe gonzález psoe françois mitterrand ps and helmut schmidt spd during all the years  in addition along with these other figures inspired the overhaul and the policies of tony blairs labour party the josé zapateros psoe and the andreas papandreous pasok in italy the main critics of the craxism as well as the figure of craxi are the former communists including most members of the democratic party and some media leftwing press il fatto quotidiano il manifesto lespresso la repubblica etc while the biggest supporters are the psi of riccardo nencini and various politicians of the people of freedom and the centreright as silvio berlusconi also exsocialist renato brunetta maurizio sacconi stefano caldoro and stefania craxi bettinos daughter death and legacyedit escape to tunisia and deathedit craxis grave in hammamet tunisia all this resulted in him being considered the symbol of political corruption bettino craxi escaped the laws he had once contributed to make by fleeing to hammamet tunisia in  and remained a fugitive there protected by ben alis government who was a personal friend of craxi he repeatedly declared himself innocent but never returned to italy where he had been sentenced to  years in jail because of his corruption crimes of these  years and  months were upheld on appeal craxi died on  january  at the age of  from complications of diabetes the then prime minister of and democrats of the left leader massimo dalema proposed a state funeral but his proposal was not accepted by craxis own family who accused the then government of preventing the craxi to return to italy to undergo a delicate surgery at the san raffaele hospital in milan craxis funerals took place at the cathedral of tunis and saw a large participation of the indigenous population former psi militants and other italians arrived in tunisia to make the last greetings to their leaders his supporters came outside the tunisian cathedral and targeted by insults and a launch of coins the representatives of the italian government lamberto dini and marco minniti craxis tomb

of deputy secretary receiving the commission to treat the international relations of the party as representative of psi at the socialist international craxi formed ties with some of the main european future leaders like willy brandt felipe gonzález françois mitterrand mario soares michel rocard and andreas papandreou as responsible of the psi foreign policy he supported also financially some socialist parties banned by the dictatorships of their respective countries including the spanish socialist workers party the panhellenic socialist movement and the chilean socialist party of salvador allende of whom craxi was a personal friend secretary of the socialist partyedit in  the secretary francesco de martino wrote an article in the socialist newspaper avanti that caused the fall of the government aldo moro and the subsequent snap election which saw an impressive growth of the italian communist party led by a young leader enrico berlinguer while the christian democracy managed to remain the majority party on just a few votes instead for the psi those elections were a crushing defeat the votes went down under the threshold of  de martino pointing to a new alliance with the communists was forced to resign and opened a serious crisis within the party craxi after the election as psi secretary in  bettino craxi was appointed to the vacant position of national secretary of the party ending years of factional fighting within the psi ironically the old guard saw him as shortlived leader allowing each faction time to regroup however he was able to consolidate power and implement his policies in particular he sought and managed to distance the party from the communists bringing it into an alliance with christian democracy and other centrist parties while maintaining a leftist and reformist profile craxi always opposed the historic compromise policy of moro and berlinguer a political alliance and an accommodation between the christian democrats and the communists the alliance would inevitably made it politically irrelevant the socialists he outlined for a line of alternation between the dc and the leftwing represented by his party due to the close relations between the pci and the soviet union on the morning of  march  the day on which the new cabinet led by giulio andreotti was supposed to have undergone a confidence vote in the italian parliament the car of aldo moro former prime minister and then president of dc was assaulted by a group of red brigades terrorists in via fani in rome firing automatic weapons the terrorists killed moros bodyguards and kidnapped him craxi was the only political leader together with amintore fanfani and marco pannella to declare himself available to a humanitarian solution that would allow the liberation of christian democrat statesman drawing heavy criticism on the socalled party of firmness primarily driven by the communists on  may  moros body was found in the trunk of a renault  in via caetani after  days of imprisonment during which moro was submitted to a political trial by the socalled peoples court set up by the brigate rosse and the italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners in  craxi decided to change the party logo of the party he chose a red carnation to represent the new course of the party in honour of the carnation revolution in portugal the party shrank the size of the old hammer and sickle in the lower part of the symbol it was eventually eliminated altogether in  craxi during a psi rally in july  following the resignation of president giovanni leone after a lengthy parliamentary battle craxi was able to bring together a large number of votes electing sandro pertini as new president pertini was the first socialist to hold this position pertini was also supported by the communists which considered the old socialist partisan not conducive to the new course of craxi craxi on the one hand explicitly distanced himself from leninism referring to forms of authoritarian socialism and on the other he showed supports to the civil society movements and to the battles for civil rights mainly proposed by the radical party he oversaw its image through the media as leader of psi he tried to undermine the communist party which until then had been continuously increasing its votes in elections and to consolidate the psi as a modern strongly proeuropean reformist socialdemocratic party with deep roots in the democratic leftwing this strategy called for ending most of the partys historical traditions as a workingclass trade union based party and attempting to gain new support among whitecollar and public sector employees at the same time the psi increased its presence in the big stateowned enterprises and became heavily involved in corruption and illegal party funding which would eventually result in the mani pulite investigations even if the psi never became a serious electoral challenger either to the pci or the christian democrats its pivotal position in the political arena allowed it to claim the post of prime minister for craxi after the  general election the electoral support for the christian democrats was significantly weakened leaving it with  of the vote compared to the  it gained in  the psi that had obtained only  threatened to leave the parliamentary majority unless craxi was made prime minister the christian democrats accepted this compromise to avoid a new election craxi became the first socialist in the history of the italian republic to be appointed prime minister prime minister of italyedit bettino craxi in  bettino craxi led the third longestlived government of italy during the republican era after the ii and iv silvio berlusconi cabinets and had strong influence in italian politics throughout the s for a time he was a close ally of two key figures of christian democracy giulio andreotti and arnaldo forlani in a loose crossparty alliance often dubbed caf from the first letter of the surname craxiandreottiforlani craxi had a firm grasp on a party previously troubled by factionalism and tried to distance it from the communists and to bring it closer to christian democrats and other parties his objective was to create an italian version of european reformist socialist parties like the german spd or the french socialist party the italian socialist party reached its postwar apex when it increased its share of votes in the general election of  however the italian socialist party never outgrew the much larger italian communist party whose highly charismatic leader enrico berlinguer was a fierce adversary of craxis policies through the years the main dynamic of italian postwar politics was to find a way to keep the italian communist party out of power this led to the constant formation of political alliances between parties keen on keeping the communists at bay things were further complicated by the fact that many parties had internal currents that would have welcomed the communists in the governing coalition in particular within christian democracy the largest party in italy from  until the end of the first republic domestic policyedit during craxis tenure as prime minister italy became the fifth largest industrial nation and gained entry into the g group of most industrialised nations however inflation was often in the double digits against trade union resistance the craxi government reacted by abolishing wageprice indexation a mechanism known as scala mobile or escalator under which wages had been increased automatically in line with inflation abolishing the escalator system did help reduce inflation which was also falling in other major countries but in the long term it inevitably increased industrial action as workers had to bargain for better salaries in any event the victory of the no campaign in the referendum called by the italian communist party was a major victory for craxi during his premiership the socialist party gained popularity he successfully boosted the countrys gnp and controlled inflation craxi with the christian democratic leader giulio andreotti in domestic policy a number of reforms were initiated during craxis time in office in  solidarity contracts worksharing arrangements to avoid redundancies were introduced while restrictions on parttime employment were relaxed in the field of family welfare legislation was enacted in  and  that changed the family allowance system “so that people most in need received larger amounts and coverage was progressively reduced to the point of termination once certain income levels were exceeded” as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era passing  of gross national product the level of public debt remains in excess of  of gdp today concordate with the vaticanedit in  craxi signed agreement with the vatican city that revised the lateran treaty among other things both sides declared the principle of the catholic religion as the sole religion of the italian state originally referred to by the lateran pacts shall be considered to be no longer in force the churchs position as the sole statesupported religion of italy was also ended replacing the state financing with a personal income tax called the otto per mille to which other religious groups christian and nonchristian also have access the revised concordat regulated the conditions under which civil effects are accorded to church marriages and to ecclesiastical declarations of nullity of marriages abolished articles included those concerning state recognition of knighthoods and titles of nobility conferred by the holy see the undertaking by the holy see to confer ecclesiastical honours on those authorized to perform religious functions at the request of the state or the royal household and the obligation of the holy see to enable the italian government to present political objections to the proposed appointment of diocesan bishops foreign policyedit craxi with the romanian president nicolae ceaușescu in the international arena craxi helped dissidents and socialist parties throughout the world to organise and become independent notable recipients of his logistical help were the spanish socialist workers party psoe during francisco francos dictatorship and dramatist jiři pelikan in the former czechoslovakia rare footage of craxi trying to lay flowers at the tomb of salvador allende has been unearthed from rais radiotelevisione italiana archives there is also evidence that part of craxis illegally earned money was given in secret to leftist political opposition in uruguay during the military dictatorship to solidarity in the period of jaruzelski rule in poland and to yasser arafat and his palestine liberation organization because of craxis sympathy for the palestinian cause he also played a role in the  seizure of power in tunisia by zine el abidine ben ali the sigonella crisisedit main article achille lauro hijacking internationally craxi is perhaps best remembered for an incident in october  when he refused the request of us president ronald reagan to extradite the hijackers of the cruise ship achille lauro after protracted negotiations the hijackers were given safe passage to egypt by plane three united states navy fs forced the plane down to the united states naval air facility naf of sigonella according to the version of political circles in washington craxi first gave the united states forces permission to detain the terrorists but he later reneged on the deal he ordered italian troops to surround the us forces protecting the plane craxi with the president of the united states ronald reagan this move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about terrorists targeting italy if the united states had had it their way and by the italian tradition of diplomacy with the arab world craxis decisive character may have been relevant in this resolution though the americans demanded that the italian authorities extradite abu abbas of the plo craxi stood firm on the grounds that the crime had been perpetrated on italian soil over which the italian republic had sole jurisdiction craxi rejected the us extradition order and let abu abbas – chief of the hijackers present on the plane – flee to yugoslavia the four hijackers were later found guilty and sentenced to prison terms for hijacking and the murder of a jewish american citizen leon klinghoffer abbas was later also convicted in italy in absentia and eventually died of natural causes shortly after being taken prisoner by american forces in the aftermath of the  invasion of iraq this episode earned craxi an article in the economist titled europes strong man and a standing ovation in the senate of the republic which included his communist opponents us attack on libyaedit according to giulio andreotti italys foreign minister at the time and nd prime minister of italy and abdel rahman shalgham libyas foreign minister from  until  craxi was the person who telephoned libyan leader muammar algaddafi to warn him of the impending american operation el dorado canyon retaliatory airstrikes against libya on  april  this permitted gaddafi and his family to evacuate their residence in the bab alazizia compound moments before the bombs dropped shalghams statement was also confirmed by margherita boniver foreign affairs chief of craxis socialist party at the time for the libyan attack craxis government denied the united states any rights of military overflight as did france and spain for the united states this precluded the use of european continental bases forcing the us air force component to be flown around france and spain over portugal and through the straits of gibraltar adding  miles  km each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings resignationedit in april  the secretary of the christian democracy ciriaco de mita decided not to support more craxis government this caused the immediate fall of the cabinet and the formation of a new government led by the longtime christian democratic politician amintore fanfani even though fanfani was a close friend and ally of craxi he did not participate in the swearing in ceremony sending the undersecretary to the presidency of the council giuliano amato after the premiershipedit in the  general election the psi won  of the vote a good result but less good than what craxi hoped and this time it was the christian democrats turn to govern from  to  the psi participated in four governments allowing giulio andreotti to take power in  and to govern until  the socialists held a strong balance of power which made them more powerful than the christian democrats who had to depend on it to form a majority in parliament the psi kept tight control of this advantage the alternative which craxi had wanted so much was taking shape the idea of a social unity with the other leftwing political parties including the pci proposed by craxi in  after the fall of communism he believed that the collapse of communism in eastern europe had undermined the pci and made social unity inevitable in fact the psi was in line to become the italys second largest party and to become the dominant force of a new leftwing coalition opposed to a christian democratled one this did not actually happen because of the rise of lega nord and the tangentopoli scandals involvement in tangentopoli scandaledit main article mani pulite craxi greeted by a salvo of coins as a sign of loathing by protesters the last main turning point of craxis career began in february  when socialist mp mario chiesa was arrested by police while taking a  million lira bribe from a cleaning service firm chiesa sought craxis protection for nearly a month but craxi accused him of casting a shadow on the most honest party in italy feeling marginalised and unjustly singledout chiesa divulged everything he knew to the prosecutors his revelations brought half of the milan socialists and industrialists under investigation even paolo pillitteri craxis own brotherinlaw and mayor of milan was investigated despite his parliamentary immunity as a consequence a team of milanese judges began investigating specifically the partys financing system in july  craxi finally realised the situation was serious and that he himself was going to be hit by the unfolding scandal he made an appeal before the chamber of deputies in which he claimed that everyone knew of the widespread irreguralities in the public financing of italian parties accused the deputies of hypocrisy and cowardice and called for all mps to protect the socialists from prosecution as a show of solidarity however his call was ignored craxi received his first prosecution notice in december  more followed in january and february at which point the court of milan explicitly asked parliament to authorise craxis prosecution for bribery and corruption at the time italian mps were immune from prosecution unless authorised by parliament the authorisation was denied on  april  after craxi gave an emotional speech however upon coming out of the roman raphael hotel where he lived received a salvo of coins that members coming from democratic party of the left rally and the rightists italian social movement in piazza navona threw to him as a sign of their disgust they started to jump and sing he who does not jump is a socialist from a traditional stadium chant some of the students waved lire bills singing bettino do you want these too bettino vuoi pure queste to the tune of guantanamera facing the judgesedit in december  after his prosecution was finally authorised craxi was called to testify alongside democrazia cristiana party secretary arnaldo forlani before justice antonio di pietro questions were asked about the socalled enimont superbribe which the psi and dc had jointly received and democratically shared forlani evasively asked what a bribe was while craxi after admitting to the charges brought against himself and other parties stated that the bribes were the cost of politics craxi noting that the legal process had accelerated in his case claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated in may  he fled to tunis in order to escape jail his political career ended in less than two years italys entire political class including people like andreotti and forlani was to follow suit soon the caf the craxiandreottiforlani axis which had made a pact to revive the pentapartito an alliance of five parties dc psi italian republican party italian liberal party italian democratic socialist party of the s and apply it to the s was doomed to be crushed by the popular vote as well as by the judges antonio di pietro led the mani pulite investigation team the set of anticorruption investigations carried out by the milan judges came to be collectively called mani pulite clean hands no party was spared but in some parties corruption had become more endemic than elsewhere either because of more opportunity or internal ethics to this day some people especially those who were close to craxi argue that some parties such as the italian communist party were left untouched while the leaders of then ruling coalition and in particular bettino craxi were wiped off the political map the judges in milan were put under scrutiny several times by different governments especially silvio berlusconis first government in  but no evidence of any misconduct was ever found furthermore public opinion was much less concerned about foreign financing than about the misappropriation of their money by corrupt politicians in the end the socialist party went from  of the vote to a virtual nil an ironic note was that the disgraced remnant of the party was excluded from parliament by the minimum  threshold introduced by bettino craxi himself during one of his previous governments as mentioned before during the mani pulite period craxi tried to use a daring defence tactic he maintained that all parties needed and took money illegally however they could get it to finance their activities his defence was therefore not to declare himself innocent but everybody guilty while this was basically the truth most citizens distrusted politicians and craxis defence got no sympathy by the citizens and may have even served to enrage them further it should be noted besides that some bribes didnt go to the parties at all they went to the personal wallets of the politician who happened to take them in  di pietro admitted that craxi was right when during the process enimont he accused italian communist party to have received illegal funding from the soviet union craxis sentences seemed to him criminally relevant but di pietro omitted to investigate that crime critics to his lifestyleedit craxis lifestyle was perceived to be inappropriate for the secretary of a party with so many alleged financial problems he lived in the raphael an expensive hotel in romes centre and had a large villa in hammamet tunisia as the mani pulite investigations were to uncover in the s personal corruption was endemic in italian society while many politicians including craxi would justify corruption with the necessities of a democracy political leaders at many levels enjoyed a lifestyle that should have been well out of their reach while most parties continued having financial problems rino formica a prominent member of the socialist party in those years wittily said that the convent is poor but the friars are rich furthermore craxis arrogant character won him many enemies one of his most condemned actions was blaming corruption in the socialist party on treasurer vincenzo balzamo just after the latters death in order to clear himself of any accusation he also had controversial friends such as siad barre dictator of somalia yasser arafat leader of plo and ben ali dictator of tunisia the latter provided protection to craxi when he escaped from italy craxis entourage was famously criticised by formica as a court of midgets and dancers corte di nani e ballerine indicating the often ludicrous and immoral traits of a system based on personal acquaintance rather than merit among the friends of craxis to receive smaller and larger favours silvio berlusconi is perhaps the most known he received many favours especially regarding his media empire and had a decree named after him decreto berlusconi long before he entered politics other figures were craxis mistresses ania pieroni who owned a tv station in the rome area and sandra milo who had a skyrocketing career in the stateowned tv channels rai craxi was also known for never apologising as a matter of principle most italians expected an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed craxi never apologised stating he had done nothing that everybody else had not been doing and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted judgements of european court of human rightsedit all three appeals by craxi to strasbourg court complained that his defense was not able to refute in court the accusations made by various defendants of related crimes in violation of the adversarial principle proclaimed in article  paragraph  letter d of the european convention of human rights by the way just once the european court ruled in his favour in a case of wiretapped conversations illegally made public decline and dissolution of the socialist partyedit bettino craxi resigned as party secretary in february  between  and  most members of the party left politics and three socialist deputies committed suicide craxi was succeeded by two socialist tradeunionists first giorgio benvenuto and then by ottaviano del turco in the december  provincial and municipal elections the psi was virtually wiped out receiving around  of the vote in milan where the psi had won  in  the psi received a mere  which was not even enough to elect a councillor del turco tried in vain to regain credibility for the party in the  general election what was left of psi allied itself to the alliance of progressives dominated by the postcommunist incarnation of the pci the democratic party of the left pds del turco had quickly changed the party symbol to reinforce the idea of innovation however this did not stop the psi gaining only  of the votes compared to  in  the psi got  deputies and  senators elected down from  deputies and  senators of  most of them came from the leftwing of the party as del turco himself did most socialists joined other political forces mainly forza italia the new party led by silvio berlusconi the patto segni and democratic alliance the party was disbanded on  november  after two years of agony in which almost all of its longtime leaders especially bettino craxi were involved in tangentopoli and decided to leave politics the yearold party closed down partially thanks to its leaders for their personalisation of the psi craxismedit main article craxism bettino craxi during s craxism ita craxismo was and is according to some extant an italian political ideology based on craxis thought it was informal ideology of the socialist party from  to  origins and featuresedit the craxism although the term derogatory today was based on a synthesis of social democracy socialism and social liberalism in fact if on one side the psi under craxi is required with a strong thirdworldism proarabianism environmentalism and a modern welfare state system typical of the modern left on the other hand was strongly proatlanticist and proeuropeanist and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty eg sigonella crisis american armed forces and on conservative policies on issues such as abortion and war on drugs under craxi psi moved from leftwing to centreleft much to ally with the christian democracy and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called pentapartito which ensured a stable majority to govern criticsedit today the craxism is often used in derogatory form to define a corrupt politician although some welcome him in a favourable manner this is the case of those who following the dissolution of the psi joined the newly formed forza italia of silvio berlusconi centreright but also a part of those who formed the italian socialists small party adhering to the alliance of progressives of achille occhetto centreleft finally the craxism has led to the change of the entire european socialism together with felipe gonzález psoe françois mitterrand ps and helmut schmidt spd during all the years  in addition along with these other figures inspired the overhaul and the policies of tony blairs labour party the josé zapateros psoe and the andreas papandreous pasok in italy the main critics of the craxism as well as the figure of craxi are the former communists including most members of the democratic party and some media leftwing press il fatto quotidiano il manifesto lespresso la repubblica etc while the biggest supporters are the psi of riccardo nencini and various politicians of the people of freedom and the centreright as silvio berlusconi also exsocialist renato brunetta maurizio sacconi stefano caldoro and stefania craxi bettinos daughter death and legacyedit escape to tunisia and deathedit craxis grave in hammamet tunisia all this resulted in him being considered the symbol of political corruption bettino craxi escaped the laws he had once contributed to make by fleeing to hammamet tunisia in  and remained a fugitive there protected by ben alis government who was a personal friend of craxi he repeatedly declared himself innocent but never returned to italy where he had been sentenced to  years in jail because of his corruption crimes of these  years and  months were upheld on appeal craxi died on  january  at the age of  from complications of diabetes the then prime minister of and democrats of the left leader massimo dalema proposed a state funeral but his proposal was not accepted by craxis own family who accused the then government of preventing the craxi to return to italy to undergo a delicate surgery at the san raffaele hospital in milan craxis funerals took place at the cathedral of tunis and saw a large participation of the indigenous population former psi militants and other italians arrived in tunisia to make the last greetings to their leaders his supporters came outside the tunisian cathedral and targeted by insults and a launch of coins the representatives of the italian government lamberto dini and marco minniti craxis tomb

a step by start the seminary vittorio craxi stood in the  general election for the popular democratic front a political alliance between socialists and communists bettino campaigned for his father and later joined the italian socialist party at the age of  early political careeredit craxi during s in his first years as deputy craxi was precocious and ascended to many levels of public office at an early age meanwhile attended the faculty of law in university of milan and then the one of political science in urbino craxi founded the socialist university nucleus joining the new university group and adhering to the cudi italian democratic university centre the student group that supported the leftwing forces in this period he held the first public speaking organizing conferences debates film screenings and in  became part of the psi provincial committee in milan and leader of the socialist youth federation in  following the soviet invasion of hungary craxi with a group of loyalists committed himself to the detachment of the socialist party by the procommunist policy but he failed his proposed output of the socialist youth movement by the international organisation of democratic youth was rejected in november  he was elected town councilor in santangelo lodigiano birthplace of his mother from and in  he was elected to the central committee of the psi representing the autonomist current pietro nenni in  the party sent him to sesto san giovanni as a responsible of the organization in november  he was elected city councilor in milan with more than  preferences and became assessor in the junta of gino cassinis in  he was excluded from the central committee of the socialist party by the new secretary francesco de martino in  he was appointed leader of the milan provincial secretariat of the psi and in  craxi became a member of the national leadership meanwhile in november  he was reelected city councilor in milan continuing his public commitment as assessor for charity and assistance in the council of pietro bucalossi in  with the formation of the unified socialist party a political alliance between the socialist party and the social democratic party craxi became provincial secretary of the psu in milan along with by the social democrat enrico rizzi and renzo peruzzotti in  general election craxi was elected for the first time at the chamber of deputies with  votes in the constituency of milan–pavia nel  after the end of the psu alliance craxi became vice secretary of the psi as proposed by giacomo mancini during this period he was a strong supporters of the organic centreleft coalition between the christian democrats of aldo moro and amintore fanfani the socialists of pietro nenni the social democrats of giuseppe saragat and the republicans of ugo la malfa in  with the reelection of francesco de martino as national secretary of the socialist party during the genoa congress craxi was confirmed with giovanni mosca in the role of deputy secretary receiving the commission to treat the international relations of the party as representative of psi at the socialist international craxi formed ties with some of the main european future leaders like willy brandt felipe gonzález françois mitterrand mario soares michel rocard and andreas papandreou as responsible of the psi foreign policy he supported also financially some socialist parties banned by the dictatorships of their respective countries including the spanish socialist workers party the panhellenic socialist movement and the chilean socialist party of salvador allende of whom craxi was a personal friend secretary of the socialist partyedit in  the secretary francesco de martino wrote an article in the socialist newspaper avanti that caused the fall of the government aldo moro and the subsequent snap election which saw an impressive growth of the italian communist party led by a young leader enrico berlinguer while the christian democracy managed to remain the majority party on just a few votes instead for the psi those elections were a crushing defeat the votes went down under the threshold of  de martino pointing to a new alliance with the communists was forced to resign and opened a serious crisis within the party craxi after the election as psi secretary in  bettino craxi was appointed to the vacant position of national secretary of the party ending years of factional fighting within the psi ironically the old guard saw him as shortlived leader allowing each faction time to regroup however he was able to consolidate power and implement his policies in particular he sought and managed to distance the party from the communists bringing it into an alliance with christian democracy and other centrist parties while maintaining a leftist and reformist profile craxi always opposed the historic compromise policy of moro and berlinguer a political alliance and an accommodation between the christian democrats and the communists the alliance would inevitably made it politically irrelevant the socialists he outlined for a line of alternation between the dc and the leftwing represented by his party due to the close relations between the pci and the soviet union on the morning of  march  the day on which the new cabinet led by giulio andreotti was supposed to have undergone a confidence vote in the italian parliament the car of aldo moro former prime minister and then president of dc was assaulted by a group of red brigades terrorists in via fani in rome firing automatic weapons the terrorists killed moros bodyguards and kidnapped him craxi was the only political leader together with amintore fanfani and marco pannella to declare himself available to a humanitarian solution that would allow the liberation of christian democrat statesman drawing heavy criticism on the socalled party of firmness primarily driven by the communists on  may  moros body was found in the trunk of a renault  in via caetani after  days of imprisonment during which moro was submitted to a political trial by the socalled peoples court set up by the brigate rosse and the italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners in  craxi decided to change the party logo of the party he chose a red carnation to represent the new course of the party in honour of the carnation revolution in portugal the party shrank the size of the old hammer and sickle in the lower part of the symbol it was eventually eliminated altogether in  craxi during a psi rally in july  following the resignation of president giovanni leone after a lengthy parliamentary battle craxi was able to bring together a large number of votes electing sandro pertini as new president pertini was the first socialist to hold this position pertini was also supported by the communists which considered the old socialist partisan not conducive to the new course of craxi craxi on the one hand explicitly distanced himself from leninism referring to forms of authoritarian socialism and on the other he showed supports to the civil society movements and to the battles for civil rights mainly proposed by the radical party he oversaw its image through the media as leader of psi he tried to undermine the communist party which until then had been continuously increasing its votes in elections and to consolidate the psi as a modern strongly proeuropean reformist socialdemocratic party with deep roots in the democratic leftwing this strategy called for ending most of the partys historical traditions as a workingclass trade union based party and attempting to gain new support among whitecollar and public sector employees at the same time the psi increased its presence in the big stateowned enterprises and became heavily involved in corruption and illegal party funding which would eventually result in the mani pulite investigations even if the psi never became a serious electoral challenger either to the pci or the christian democrats its pivotal position in the political arena allowed it to claim the post of prime minister for craxi after the  general election the electoral support for the christian democrats was significantly weakened leaving it with  of the vote compared to the  it gained in  the psi that had obtained only  threatened to leave the parliamentary majority unless craxi was made prime minister the christian democrats accepted this compromise to avoid a new election craxi became the first socialist in the history of the italian republic to be appointed prime minister prime minister of italyedit bettino craxi in  bettino craxi led the third longestlived government of italy during the republican era after the ii and iv silvio berlusconi cabinets and had strong influence in italian politics throughout the s for a time he was a close ally of two key figures of christian democracy giulio andreotti and arnaldo forlani in a loose crossparty alliance often dubbed caf from the first letter of the surname craxiandreottiforlani craxi had a firm grasp on a party previously troubled by factionalism and tried to distance it from the communists and to bring it closer to christian democrats and other parties his objective was to create an italian version of european reformist socialist parties like the german spd or the french socialist party the italian socialist party reached its postwar apex when it increased its share of votes in the general election of  however the italian socialist party never outgrew the much larger italian communist party whose highly charismatic leader enrico berlinguer was a fierce adversary of craxis policies through the years the main dynamic of italian postwar politics was to find a way to keep the italian communist party out of power this led to the constant formation of political alliances between parties keen on keeping the communists at bay things were further complicated by the fact that many parties had internal currents that would have welcomed the communists in the governing coalition in particular within christian democracy the largest party in italy from  until the end of the first republic domestic policyedit during craxis tenure as prime minister italy became the fifth largest industrial nation and gained entry into the g group of most industrialised nations however inflation was often in the double digits against trade union resistance the craxi government reacted by abolishing wageprice indexation a mechanism known as scala mobile or escalator under which wages had been increased automatically in line with inflation abolishing the escalator system did help reduce inflation which was also falling in other major countries but in the long term it inevitably increased industrial action as workers had to bargain for better salaries in any event the victory of the no campaign in the referendum called by the italian communist party was a major victory for craxi during his premiership the socialist party gained popularity he successfully boosted the countrys gnp and controlled inflation craxi with the christian democratic leader giulio andreotti in domestic policy a number of reforms were initiated during craxis time in office in  solidarity contracts worksharing arrangements to avoid redundancies were introduced while restrictions on parttime employment were relaxed in the field of family welfare legislation was enacted in  and  that changed the family allowance system “so that people most in need received larger amounts and coverage was progressively reduced to the point of termination once certain income levels were exceeded” as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era passing  of gross national product the level of public debt remains in excess of  of gdp today concordate with the vaticanedit in  craxi signed agreement with the vatican city that revised the lateran treaty among other things both sides declared the principle of the catholic religion as the sole religion of the italian state originally referred to by the lateran pacts shall be considered to be no longer in force the churchs position as the sole statesupported religion of italy was also ended replacing the state financing with a personal income tax called the otto per mille to which other religious groups christian and nonchristian also have access the revised concordat regulated the conditions under which civil effects are accorded to church marriages and to ecclesiastical declarations of nullity of marriages abolished articles included those concerning state recognition of knighthoods and titles of nobility conferred by the holy see the undertaking by the holy see to confer ecclesiastical honours on those authorized to perform religious functions at the request of the state or the royal household and the obligation of the holy see to enable the italian government to present political objections to the proposed appointment of diocesan bishops foreign policyedit craxi with the romanian president nicolae ceaușescu in the international arena craxi helped dissidents and socialist parties throughout the world to organise and become independent notable recipients of his logistical help were the spanish socialist workers party psoe during francisco francos dictatorship and dramatist jiři pelikan in the former czechoslovakia rare footage of craxi trying to lay flowers at the tomb of salvador allende has been unearthed from rais radiotelevisione italiana archives there is also evidence that part of craxis illegally earned money was given in secret to leftist political opposition in uruguay during the military dictatorship to solidarity in the period of jaruzelski rule in poland and to yasser arafat and his palestine liberation organization because of craxis sympathy for the palestinian cause he also played a role in the  seizure of power in tunisia by zine el abidine ben ali the sigonella crisisedit main article achille lauro hijacking internationally craxi is perhaps best remembered for an incident in october  when he refused the request of us president ronald reagan to extradite the hijackers of the cruise ship achille lauro after protracted negotiations the hijackers were given safe passage to egypt by plane three united states navy fs forced the plane down to the united states naval air facility naf of sigonella according to the version of political circles in washington craxi first gave the united states forces permission to detain the terrorists but he later reneged on the deal he ordered italian troops to surround the us forces protecting the plane craxi with the president of the united states ronald reagan this move was supposedly dictated both by security concerns about terrorists targeting italy if the united states had had it their way and by the italian tradition of diplomacy with the arab world craxis decisive character may have been relevant in this resolution though the americans demanded that the italian authorities extradite abu abbas of the plo craxi stood firm on the grounds that the crime had been perpetrated on italian soil over which the italian republic had sole jurisdiction craxi rejected the us extradition order and let abu abbas – chief of the hijackers present on the plane – flee to yugoslavia the four hijackers were later found guilty and sentenced to prison terms for hijacking and the murder of a jewish american citizen leon klinghoffer abbas was later also convicted in italy in absentia and eventually died of natural causes shortly after being taken prisoner by american forces in the aftermath of the  invasion of iraq this episode earned craxi an article in the economist titled europes strong man and a standing ovation in the senate of the republic which included his communist opponents us attack on libyaedit according to giulio andreotti italys foreign minister at the time and nd prime minister of italy and abdel rahman shalgham libyas foreign minister from  until  craxi was the person who telephoned libyan leader muammar algaddafi to warn him of the impending american operation el dorado canyon retaliatory airstrikes against libya on  april  this permitted gaddafi and his family to evacuate their residence in the bab alazizia compound moments before the bombs dropped shalghams statement was also confirmed by margherita boniver foreign affairs chief of craxis socialist party at the time for the libyan attack craxis government denied the united states any rights of military overflight as did france and spain for the united states this precluded the use of european continental bases forcing the us air force component to be flown around france and spain over portugal and through the straits of gibraltar adding  miles  km each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings resignationedit in april  the secretary of the christian democracy ciriaco de mita decided not to support more craxis government this caused the immediate fall of the cabinet and the formation of a new government led by the longtime christian democratic politician amintore fanfani even though fanfani was a close friend and ally of craxi he did not participate in the swearing in ceremony sending the undersecretary to the presidency of the council giuliano amato after the premiershipedit in the  general election the psi won  of the vote a good result but less good than what craxi hoped and this time it was the christian democrats turn to govern from  to  the psi participated in four governments allowing giulio andreotti to take power in  and to govern until  the socialists held a strong balance of power which made them more powerful than the christian democrats who had to depend on it to form a majority in parliament the psi kept tight control of this advantage the alternative which craxi had wanted so much was taking shape the idea of a social unity with the other leftwing political parties including the pci proposed by craxi in  after the fall of communism he believed that the collapse of communism in eastern europe had undermined the pci and made social unity inevitable in fact the psi was in line to become the italys second largest party and to become the dominant force of a new leftwing coalition opposed to a christian democratled one this did not actually happen because of the rise of lega nord and the tangentopoli scandals involvement in tangentopoli scandaledit main article mani pulite craxi greeted by a salvo of coins as a sign of loathing by protesters the last main turning point of craxis career began in february  when socialist mp mario chiesa was arrested by police while taking a  million lira bribe from a cleaning service firm chiesa sought craxis protection for nearly a month but craxi accused him of casting a shadow on the most honest party in italy feeling marginalised and unjustly singledout chiesa divulged everything he knew to the prosecutors his revelations brought half of the milan socialists and industrialists under investigation even paolo pillitteri craxis own brotherinlaw and mayor of milan was investigated despite his parliamentary immunity as a consequence a team of milanese judges began investigating specifically the partys financing system in july  craxi finally realised the situation was serious and that he himself was going to be hit by the unfolding scandal he made an appeal before the chamber of deputies in which he claimed that everyone knew of the widespread irreguralities in the public financing of italian parties accused the deputies of hypocrisy and cowardice and called for all mps to protect the socialists from prosecution as a show of solidarity however his call was ignored craxi received his first prosecution notice in december  more followed in january and february at which point the court of milan explicitly asked parliament to authorise craxis prosecution for bribery and corruption at the time italian mps were immune from prosecution unless authorised by parliament the authorisation was denied on  april  after craxi gave an emotional speech however upon coming out of the roman raphael hotel where he lived received a salvo of coins that members coming from democratic party of the left rally and the rightists italian social movement in piazza navona threw to him as a sign of their disgust they started to jump and sing he who does not jump is a socialist from a traditional stadium chant some of the students waved lire bills singing bettino do you want these too bettino vuoi pure queste to the tune of guantanamera facing the judgesedit in december  after his prosecution was finally authorised craxi was called to testify alongside democrazia cristiana party secretary arnaldo forlani before justice antonio di pietro questions were asked about the socalled enimont superbribe which the psi and dc had jointly received and democratically shared forlani evasively asked what a bribe was while craxi after admitting to the charges brought against himself and other parties stated that the bribes were the cost of politics craxi noting that the legal process had accelerated in his case claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated in may  he fled to tunis in order to escape jail his political career ended in less than two years italys entire political class including people like andreotti and forlani was to follow suit soon the caf the craxiandreottiforlani axis which had made a pact to revive the pentapartito an alliance of five parties dc psi italian republican party italian liberal party italian democratic socialist party of the s and apply it to the s was doomed to be crushed by the popular vote as well as by the judges antonio di pietro led the mani pulite investigation team the set of anticorruption investigations carried out by the milan judges came to be collectively called mani pulite clean hands no party was spared but in some parties corruption had become more endemic than elsewhere either because of more opportunity or internal ethics to this day some people especially those who were close to craxi argue that some parties such as the italian communist party were left untouched while the leaders of then ruling coalition and in particular bettino craxi were wiped off the political map the judges in milan were put under scrutiny several times by different governments especially silvio berlusconis first government in  but no evidence of any misconduct was ever found furthermore public opinion was much less concerned about foreign financing than about the misappropriation of their money by corrupt politicians in the end the socialist party went from  of the vote to a virtual nil an ironic note was that the disgraced remnant of the party was excluded from parliament by the minimum  threshold introduced by bettino craxi himself during one of his previous governments as mentioned before during the mani pulite period craxi tried to use a daring defence tactic he maintained that all parties needed and took money illegally however they could get it to finance their activities his defence was therefore not to declare himself innocent but everybody guilty while this was basically the truth most citizens distrusted politicians and craxis defence got no sympathy by the citizens and may have even served to enrage them further it should be noted besides that some bribes didnt go to the parties at all they went to the personal wallets of the politician who happened to take them in  di pietro admitted that craxi was right when during the process enimont he accused italian communist party to have received illegal funding from the soviet union craxis sentences seemed to him criminally relevant but di pietro omitted to investigate that crime critics to his lifestyleedit craxis lifestyle was perceived to be inappropriate for the secretary of a party with so many alleged financial problems he lived in the raphael an expensive hotel in romes centre and had a large villa in hammamet tunisia as the mani pulite investigations were to uncover in the s personal corruption was endemic in italian society while many politicians including craxi would justify corruption with the necessities of a democracy political leaders at many levels enjoyed a lifestyle that should have been well out of their reach while most parties continued having financial problems rino formica a prominent member of the socialist party in those years wittily said that the convent is poor but the friars are rich furthermore craxis arrogant character won him many enemies one of his most condemned actions was blaming corruption in the socialist party on treasurer vincenzo balzamo just after the latters death in order to clear himself of any accusation he also had controversial friends such as siad barre dictator of somalia yasser arafat leader of plo and ben ali dictator of tunisia the latter provided protection to craxi when he escaped from italy craxis entourage was famously criticised by formica as a court of midgets and dancers corte di nani e ballerine indicating the often ludicrous and immoral traits of a system based on personal acquaintance rather than merit among the friends of craxis to receive smaller and larger favours silvio berlusconi is perhaps the most known he received many favours especially regarding his media empire and had a decree named after him decreto berlusconi long before he entered politics other figures were craxis mistresses ania pieroni who owned a tv station in the rome area and sandra milo who had a skyrocketing career in the stateowned tv channels rai craxi was also known for never apologising as a matter of principle most italians expected an apology after the corrupt system had been exposed craxi never apologised stating he had done nothing that everybody else had not been doing and that he was being unjustly singled out and persecuted judgements of european court of human rightsedit all three appeals by craxi to strasbourg court complained that his defense was not able to refute in court the accusations made by various defendants of related crimes in violation of the adversarial principle proclaimed in article  paragraph  letter d of the european convention of human rights by the way just once the european court ruled in his favour in a case of wiretapped conversations illegally made public decline and dissolution of the socialist partyedit bettino craxi resigned as party secretary in february  between  and  most members of the party left politics and three socialist deputies committed suicide craxi was succeeded by two socialist tradeunionists first giorgio benvenuto and then by ottaviano del turco in the december  provincial and municipal elections the psi was virtually wiped out receiving around  of the vote in milan where the psi had won  in  the psi received a mere  which was not even enough to elect a councillor del turco tried in vain to regain credibility for the party in the  general election what was left of psi allied itself to the alliance of progressives dominated by the postcommunist incarnation of the pci the democratic party of the left pds del turco had quickly changed the party symbol to reinforce the idea of innovation however this did not stop the psi gaining only  of the votes compared to  in  the psi got  deputies and  senators elected down from  deputies and  senators of  most of them came from the leftwing of the party as del turco himself did most socialists joined other political forces mainly forza italia the new party led by silvio berlusconi the patto segni and democratic alliance the party was disbanded on  november  after two years of agony in which almost all of its longtime leaders especially bettino craxi were involved in tangentopoli and decided to leave politics the yearold party closed down partially thanks to its leaders for their personalisation of the psi craxismedit main article craxism bettino craxi during s craxism ita craxismo was and is according to some extant an italian political ideology based on craxis thought it was informal ideology of the socialist party from  to  origins and featuresedit the craxism although the term derogatory today was based on a synthesis of social democracy socialism and social liberalism in fact if on one side the psi under craxi is required with a strong thirdworldism proarabianism environmentalism and a modern welfare state system typical of the modern left on the other hand was strongly proatlanticist and proeuropeanist and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty eg sigonella crisis american armed forces and on conservative policies on issues such as abortion and war on drugs under craxi psi moved from leftwing to centreleft much to ally with the christian democracy and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called pentapartito which ensured a stable majority to govern criticsedit today the craxism is often used in derogatory form to define a corrupt politician although some welcome him in a favourable manner this is the case of those who following the dissolution of the psi joined the newly formed forza italia of silvio berlusconi centreright but also a part of those who formed the italian socialists small party adhering to the alliance of progressives of achille occhetto centreleft finally the craxism has led to the change of the entire european socialism together with felipe gonzález psoe françois mitterrand ps and helmut schmidt spd during all the years  in addition along with these other figures inspired the overhaul and the policies of tony blairs labour party the josé zapateros psoe and the andreas papandreous pasok in italy the main critics of the craxism as well as the figure of craxi are the former communists including most members of the democratic party and some media leftwing press il fatto quotidiano il manifesto lespresso la repubblica etc while the biggest supporters are the psi of riccardo nencini and various politicians of the people of freedom and the centreright as silvio berlusconi also exsocialist renato brunetta maurizio sacconi stefano caldoro and stefania craxi bettinos daughter death and legacyedit escape to tunisia and deathedit craxis grave in hammamet tunisia all this resulted in him being considered the symbol of political corruption bettino craxi escaped the laws he had once contributed to make by fleeing to hammamet tunisia in  and remained a fugitive there protected by ben alis government who was a personal friend of craxi he repeatedly declared himself innocent but never returned to italy where he had been sentenced to  years in jail because of his corruption crimes of these  years and  months were upheld on appeal craxi died on  january  at the age of  from complications of diabetes the then prime minister of and democrats of the left leader massimo dalema proposed a state funeral but his proposal was not accepted by craxis own family who accused the then government of preventing the craxi to return to italy to undergo a delicate surgery at the san raffaele hospital in milan craxis funerals took place at the cathedral of tunis and saw a large participation of the indigenous population former psi militants and other italians arrived in tunisia to make the last greetings to their leaders his supporters came outside the tunisian cathedral and targeted by insults and a launch of coins the representatives of the italian government lamberto dini and marco minniti craxis tomb is in the small christian cemetery in hammamet according to some sources it is oriented towards italy   but following a  survey this has revealed to be erraneous   referencesedit  i tre più potenti
