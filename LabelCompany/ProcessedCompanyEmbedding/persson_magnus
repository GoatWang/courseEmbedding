modularization on companies’ financial performanceyr t th innovation and product development management conference reykjavikab there is a constantly increasing need for companies to become more cost efficient for example to reduce its product development cost and shorten the development leadtime many companies has therefore adopted a product modularization strategy however the research on financial performance effects of product modularization still remains limited therefore the purpose of this paper is to investigate the financial effects of product modularization and how these effects are moderated by cost efficiency pressure this is done based on data collected through an online questionnaire the population for the survey is the swedish manufacturing industry and all firms in that industry with more than 00 employees and having product development within their business unit the final sample was 0 business units corresponding with a response rate of  percent the analyses show that the degree of product modularization has positive effects on financial performance but a higher degree of cost efficiency pressure will affect financial performance negatively we also found a moderation effect the degree of product modularization has positive financial effects in markets with low or medium high cost efficiency pressure but in contexts with high cost efficiency pressure we could not find the same positive effectsla engol  denna post skapades 0 cpl pubid 09   institutioner chalmers institutionen för teknikens ekonomi och organisation innovation and rd management
