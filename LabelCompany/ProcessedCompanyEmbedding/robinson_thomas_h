doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank was passed in  as a response to the recent financial crisis the purpose of the law as policymakers argued was to rein in large wall street firms that contributed to the crisis in order to prevent future financial crises after  pages of legislative text and nearly  pages of regulatory text the impact of doddfrank is much broader than originally anticipated new rules and regulations aimed at larger banks and financial institutions are affecting smaller banks which were not a principal regulatory target of doddfrank in a study conducted for the mercatus center at george mason university scholars hester peirce ian robinson and thomas stratmann present the results of a summer  survey that asked small banks how they and their customers were being affected by doddfrank with a sample of approximately  small banks the study indicates doddfrank regulations are adversely affecting them the small bank survey in four sections the question survey gathered responses from more than  small banks across  states the survey defined small banks as those with less than  billion in assets—the threshold used by several regulators reflective of the general population of small banks the majority of the surveyed banks held under  billion in assets participating banks remained anonymous but provided characteristics about their geographic location charter type and size as well as the products and services they offered the survey included questions about specific regulatory and compliance activities interactions with regulators effects of particular regulations changes in fees and revenue and business strategy decisions since the passage of doddfrank the breadth and depth of the questions make the survey unique among similar surveys by regulators consultants and trade associations principal findings increased compliance costs  percent of responding banks state that compliance costs increased since the passage of doddfrank with nearly  percent reporting increases of more than  percent roughly  percent of respondents view doddfrank as more burdensome than the bank secrecy act a notoriously onerous regulatory regime the median number of compliance staff for the small banks participating in the survey increased from one to two employees more than a quarter of the banks anticipated hiring additional compliance personnel in the next year limited customer access small banks report having eliminated or planning to discontinue certain products and services as a result of doddfrank residential mortgages mortgage servicing home equity lines of credit and overdraft protection are among the most likely products and services to be cut nearly  percent of the banks surveyed anticipate making changes to the nature mix and volume of mortgage products and services as a result of new regulations roughly  percent anticipate discontinuing residential mortgages due to doddfrank and approximately  percent have already done so more than a quarter of respondents anticipate engaging in a merger or acquisition in the near future which would reduce the number of small banks concerns with the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb narrative responses throughout the survey show that the cfpb’s activities and mortgage regulations are of great concern to small banks despite the cfpb having no direct supervisory authority over small banks  percent of surveyed banks said the cfpb is affecting their business activities the cfpb was a frequently cited factor affecting small banks’ mortgage offerings diminished community relationships narrative responses revealed a belief that doddfrank challenges an essential feature of small banks this is their ability to develop and cultivate customer relationships in the communities they serve by gathering “soft information” about customers and the surrounding community enabling them to lend to nontraditional customers and small businesses a commonly expressed view is that the customertailored approach to banking is not consistent with the doddfrank regulatory framework which favors the standardized lending criteria often employed by larger banks respondents expressed frustration that the new regulatory costs rather than helping bank customers make it harder for customers to get the products and services they need conclusion doddfrank has proved burdensome to small banks and customers are seeing the effects of the increased regulatory burden through reduced product and service offerings as small banks rethink their lines of business and consider consolidation activity the survey data illustrate these adverse impacts and should help policymakers better understand how to achieve their policy objectives without unduly adding to the already substantial regulatory burdens on small banks small banks play an important role in serving small communities small businesses and borrowers with unique needs regulatory policy that allows small banks to serve their communities rather than diverting resources from customer service to regulatory compliance checklists will be critical to these banks’ continued survival  click here for the full survey analysis   financial regulationdoddfrankbank regulationregulationfinancial marketsfinancial crisis related content eventshow will doddfrank affect
