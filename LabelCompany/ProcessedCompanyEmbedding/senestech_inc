senestech launches contrapest® fertility control product ’research sales’ senestech launches contrapest® fertility control product research sales news provided by senestech inc dec    et share this article flagstaff ariz dec   prnewswire  senestech inc nasdaq snes a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control today announced the launch of contrapest research sales as part of its go to market strategy for commercializing its lead product on august   senestech received registration from the us epa for its first product contrapest® this registration the first for a nonlethal fertility control product for managing rat populations now allows for the marketing of contrapest in the us and is globally seen as the first new product with the potential to effectively address rat infestations the company has adopted a research sales policy with key potential customers to research the deployment and use of contrapest in customer specific settings such as housing projects and subway stations while generating revenue to the company initial research sales are already underway in washington and louisiana while potential customer projects are under discussion in new york city new jersey georgia and california senestech is also pursuing opportunities outside the us in the united kingdom germany and australia it is key that we work closely with the early adopters of our fertility control technology said dr loretta p mayer chair ceo and cofounder of senestech we are changing the paradigm of pest control reducing the use of poisons with a safer more sustainable solution we continue to learn how best to do this with these early adopters while adding this approach to their integrated pest management plans  this strategy allows a scientific product learning cycle as well as generating cash flow for further growth we can also use this model to more rapidly respond to urgent global infestations such as those rapidly emerging in paris about senestech senestech has developed an innovative technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control as opposed to a lethal approach the companys first fertility control product candidate contrapest® will be marketed for use initially in controlling rat infestations contrapests novel technology and approach targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes inducing egg loss in female rodents and impairing sperm development in males using proprietary bait stations contrapest is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rodent communities contrapest is designed formulated and dispensed to be safe for handlers and nontarget species such as wildlife livestock and pets in a biodegradable product in contrast the historical approach to managing rodent pest populations rodenticides carries a high risk of environmental contamination and the poisoning of nontarget animals pets and children the company believes its nonlethal approach targeting reproduction is more humane less harmful to the environment and more effective in providing a sustainable solution to pest infestations than traditional lethal pest management methods there is currently no other nonlethal fertility control product approved by the food and drug administration fda or the environmental protection agency epa for the management of rodent populations the company believes contrapest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control resulting in improved performance in rodent control over rodenticides without the negative environmental effects of rodenticides  for more information visit the senestech website at wwwsenestechcom safe harbor statementthis release contains forwardlooking statements within the

surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their

the root cause rat reproduction senestech’s first product to be commercialized is a nonlethal compound designed to reduce rat populations by controlling reproduction we change the paradigm of rodent control by targeting the root cause of escalating populations reproduction the incredible speed at which rats reproduce and multiply is astounding two rat mating couples can over an  to  month life span generate  million descendants while alive they guard their territory from neighboring tribes who would invade if there were a sudden drop in population the cause of poison’s “rebound effect” how it works our patented formulation causes both female and male rats to become infertile once they have consumed the effective dose the active ingredient in females accelerates the rate at which ovarian follicles egg structures are depleted once these cells are gone the animal cannot reproduce in males there is a marked reduction in the ability to fertilize eggs and often complete sterility otherwise the animal lives out its normal  to  month life span without any observable side effects it’s a truly humane approach that is also effective because it allows populations to taper off naturally without a “rebound” orally selfadministered and costeffective our nonlethal compound is placed in a liquid bait that brings rats back for seconds thirds and more they happily help themselves until over a few weeks both the males and the females have made themselves infertile otherwise they continue to lead normal lives rats need to consume at least  of their body weight in liquid every day and our bait gives them an attractive source as they build up to the effective dose once ingested our formula quickly becomes inactive it is designed to be environmentally neutral when excreted the senestech bait is specifically formulated for rats and does not affect other animal species or humans senestech is thus a sustainable and humane approach to pest control recent newsrodent bait causing

prnewswire  senestech inc snes a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control announced today that in an effort to ensure that the company can meet the rapidly increasing demand for their innovative new rodent control technology contrapest it has launched its second manufacturing line in flagstaff with the addition of this second line the companys existing manufacturing capacity is expected to more than doublesenestech inc is a leader in technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility controlmorewe continue to learn and improve and have incorporated that knowledge into this second line we are confident that we will be able to handle the anticipated increase in demand said elissa calloway vice president of manufacturing at senestechin order to utilize both manufacturing lines senestech has added additional staff in both manufacturing and quality controldelighting our customers is our primary focus our increased capacity insures timely and uninterrupted delivery of contrapest said andrew altman chief operating officer about senestechsenestech has developed an innovative technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control as opposed to a lethal approachthe companys first fertility control product contrapest® is marketed for use in controlling rat infestations contrapests novel technology and approach targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes inducing egg loss in female rodents and impairing sperm development in males using proprietary bait stations contrapest is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rodent communities contrapest is designed formulated and dispensed to be safe for handlers and nontarget species such as wildlife livestock and pets in a biodegradable product in contrast the historical approach to managing rodent pest populations rodenticides carries a high risk of environmental contamination and the poisoning of nontarget animals pets and childrenwe believe our nonlethal approach targeting reproduction is more humane less harmful to the environment and more effective in providing a sustainable solution to pest infestations than traditional lethal pest management methods there is currently no other nonlethal fertility control product approved by the food and drug administration fda or the environmental protection agency epa for the management of rodent populations  we believe contrapest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control resulting in improved performance in rodent control over rodenticides without the negative environmental effects of rodenticides  for more information visit the senestech website at wwwsenestechcomsafe harbor
