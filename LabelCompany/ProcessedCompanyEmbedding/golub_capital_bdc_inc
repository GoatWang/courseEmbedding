very low non accruals consistently increasing navshare but valuation is fair and niishare is likely to remain flat  initiating with a neutral rating and  price target november   christopher r testa  this email address is being protected from spambots you need javascript enabled to view it investment conclusion we are initiating coverage of golub capital bdc inc gbdc with a neutral rating and  price target gbdc is the public vehicle of the golub family of funds which combined have total aum assets under management of over  billion as of  making them one of the largest bdcs public  private additionally the total platform is almost entirely in leveraged loans and the ability to invest across funds provides gbdc with a significant advantage during a time when certainty of closing matters more to borrowers than pricing this also permits the company to have relatively small hold sizes within the portfolio while still closing on larger deals in the platform mitigating the risk of concentration within gbdc this is demonstrated by the fact that gbdc finished  with a portfolio at fair value of  billion across  companies but the average investment size was a mere  million since the quarter ended  nonaccruals as a percentage of par have averaged  this strong asset quality at golub has led to consistent navshare increases generating strong economic returns changes in navshare plus dividends divided by beginning of period navshare for shareholders we expect gbdc’s niishare to be largely flat although we expect further stepups in navshare and continued sound asset quality despite golub being a bestinclass originator we believe the stock is fairly valued and we are therefore giving the company a neutral rating and  price target our  price target implies an estimated
