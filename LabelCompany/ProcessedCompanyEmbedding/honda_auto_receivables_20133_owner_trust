us trust indenture act of  breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on dbntc and dbtcas alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york the “sdny action” on behalf of and for the benefit of  privatelabel rmbs trusts which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action the complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of us  billion but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain dbntc and dbtca filed a motion to dismiss and on january   the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds as to the  trusts that are governed by pooling and servicing agreements the court declined to exercise jurisdiction the court did            not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss as to the  trusts formed under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction instead the court ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint as to those indenture trusts on february   plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as to  of the  indenture trusts included in the original us district court complaint dbntc and dbtca will have an opportunity to file new defensive motions with respect to this amended complaint   on march   plaintiffs filed a new state court complaint in california against dbtca as to  trusts governed by pooling

 trusts   on december   ikb international sa and ikb deutsche industriebank ag filed a summons with notice in new york state court naming as defendants dbntc and dbtca as trustees of  rmbs trusts the ikb action the claims in the ikb action appear to be substantively similar to the sdny action the ikb action is not styled as a putative class action but may attempt to bring derivative claims on behalf of the named rmbs trusts dbtca intends to vigorously defend the ikb action   dbtca has no pending legal proceedings including based on dbtcas present evaluation the litigation disclosed in the
