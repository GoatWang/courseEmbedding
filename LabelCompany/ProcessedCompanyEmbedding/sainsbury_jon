ann opened a store at  drury lane in holborn london sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar his trading philosophy as stated on a sign outside his first shop in islington was quality perfect prices lower sainsburys was very innovative in that its stores instead of featuring five ownbrand lines as archrival home and colonial did offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison also instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters sainsburys boasted marble counters mosaic floors and whitetiled walls staff even had a uniform of white aprons stores started to look similar so people could recognise them throughout london a high castiron j sainsbury sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses and roundtheback deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to sainsburys popularity in  j sainsbury was incorporated as a private company as j sainsbury limited when it became the united kingdoms largest grocery group by this time each store had the following departments dairy bacon and hams poultry and game cooked meats and fresh meats groceries were introduced in  when john james purchased a grocers branch at  kingsland high street dalston home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days sites were carefully chosen with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop this allowed a larger display of products which could be kept cooler in summer which was important as there was no refrigeration by the time john james sainsbury died in  there were over  shops his last words were said to be keep the shops well lit he was replaced by his eldest son john benjamin sainsbury who had gone into partnership with his father in  during the s and s with the company now run by john james sainsburys eldest son john benjamin sainsbury the company continued to refine its product offerings and maintain its leadership in terms of store design convenience and cleanliness the company acquired the midlandsbased thoroughgood chain in  alan sainsbury the founders grandson later lord sainsbury of drury lane became joint managing director of sainsburys along with his brother sir robert sainsbury in  after their father john benjamin sainsbury had a minor heart attack following the outbreak of world war ii many of the men who worked for sainsburys were called to perform national service and were replaced by women the second world war was a difficult time for sainsburys as most of its stores were trading in the london area and were bombed or damaged turnover fell to half the prewar level food was rationed and one particular store in east grinstead was so badly damaged on friday  july  that it had to move to the local church temporarily while a new one was built this store was not completed until  selfservice and heyday –edit in  alan sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father john benjamin sainsbury during the s and s sainsburys was a keen early adopter of selfservice supermarkets in the united kingdom the first selfservice store within the country was a cooperative store opened in  on a trip to the united states of america alan sainsbury realised the benefits of selfservice stores and believed the future of sainsburys was selfservice supermarkets of  sq ft  m with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience the first selfservice branch opened in croydon in  sainsburys was a pioneer in the development of ownbrand goods the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but at a lower price it expanded more cautiously than did tesco shunning acquisitions and it never offered trading stamps until the company went public on  july  as j sainsbury plc the company was wholly owned by the sainsbury family it was at the time the largest ever flotation on the london stock exchange the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible a million shares were set aside for staff which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value within one minute the list of applications was closed £ million had been offered for £ million available shares the sainsbury family at the time retained  of the firms shares sainsburys in bradford on avon wiltshire most of the senior positions were held by family members john davan sainsbury later lord sainsbury of preston candover a member of the fourth generation of the founding family took over the chairmanship from his uncle sir robert sainsbury in  who had been chairman for two years from  following alan sainsburys retirement sainsburys started to replace its  sq ft  m high street stores with selfservice supermarkets above  sq ft  m which were either in out of town locations or in regenerated town centres sainsburys policy was to invest in uniform well designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality its slogan was good food costs less at sainsburys during the s the average size of sainsburys stores rose from  sq ft  m to around  sq ft  m the first edge of town store with  sq ft  m of selling space was opened at coldhams lane in cambridge in  the last counter service branch closed in peckham in  to participate in the hypermarket sector sainsburys formed a joint venture known as savacentre with british home stores the first savacentre store was opened in washington tyne and wear in  nearly half the space amounting to some  sq ft  m was devoted to textiles electrical goods and hardware as the hypermarket format became more mainstream with rivals such as asda and tesco launching ever larger stores it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular sainsburys superstore format in september  another diversification took place in  when sainsburys formed a joint venture with the belgian retailer gbinnobm to set up a chain of doityourself stores under the homebase name sainsburys sold the homebase chain in december  in an twofold deal worth £ million sales of the chain of

preceding  years profits had grown from £ million to over £ million a compound annual rise of  – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of  during the s the company invested in new technology the proportion of sales passing through epos scanning checkouts rose from  to  with the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the s sainsburys was one of the many big retail names to open new stores in such complexes – notably with its store at the meadowhall shopping centre sheffield originally as a savacentre in  which was converted into a regular sainsbury store in  and was closed in  and the merry hill shopping centre at brierley hill in the west midlands part of an enterprise zone which opened in september  sainsburys expanded its operation into scotland with a store in darnley which opened in january  the savacentre at cameron toll in edinburgh had opened in  in june  sainsburys announced its intention to move into the northern ireland market until that point dominated by local companies between december  and december  the company opened seven stores two others at sprucefield lisburn and holywood exchange belfast would not open until  due to protracted legal challenges sainsburys move into northern ireland was undertaken in a very different way from that of tesco while sainsburys outlets were all new developments tesco apart from one tesco metro instead purchased existing chains from associated british foods see tesco ireland in  the sainsburys group boasted a twelveyear record of dividend increases of  or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long also in  the company raised £ million in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores sainsburys decline –edit the sainsburys supermarket building in greenwich which was nominated for the stirling prize in  and has since been demolished in  the long time ceo john davan sainsbury retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin david sainsbury later lord sainsbury of turville this brought about a change in management style – david was more consensual and less hierarchical but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the companys place in the market mistakes by david sainsbury and his successors dino adriano and peter davis included the rejection of loyalty cards the reluctance to move into nonfood retailing the indecision between whether to go quality or for value the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers which led to suppliers favouring tesco over sainsburys and the unsuccessful john cleese advertising campaign at the end of  it announced price cuts on three hundred of its most popular own label lines significantly this came three months after tesco had launched its line tesco value a few months later sainsburys announced that margins had fallen that the pace of new superstore construction would slow down and that it would write down the value of some of its properties in  sainsburys announced a new town centre format sainsburys central again a response to tescos metro which was already established in five locations also in  sainsburys lost the takeover battle for william low like tesco sainsburys had long been underrepresented in scotland also that year david sainsbury dismissed tescos clubcard initiative as an electronic version of green shield stamps the company was soon forced to backtrack introducing its own reward card eighteen months later for much of the twentieth century sainsburys had been the market leader in the supermarket sector in the united kingdom but in  it lost its place as the countrys largest grocer to tesco some new ventures were successful notably the launch of a retail bank sainsburys bank in partnership with bank of scotland in addition to shaws sainsburys bought a minority stake in another supermarket group giant food based in washington dc although this shareholding was subsequently sold when ahold of the netherlands made a full bid

something new today this new brand statement was created by abbott mead vickers bbdo while the interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years the company introduced another informal font in  which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature in  sainsburys acquired an  share of egyptian distribution group sae a retailer in egypt with one hundred stores and  employees however poor profitability led to the sale of this share in april  on  october  the ceo dino adriano lost control of the core supermarket business within the united kingdom instead assuming responsibility for the rest of the group david bremner became head of the supermarkets in the united kingdom this was derided by the city and described as a fudge on  january  sainsburys reversed this decision by announcing the replacement of adriano by sir peter davis effective from march between – sir peter davis was chief executive of sainsburys davis appointment was well received by investors and analysts in his first two years he exceeded profit targets although by  the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the grocery market within the united kingdom davis also oversaw an almost £ billion upgrade of stores distribution and it equipment entitled business transformation programme but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal – improving availability part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots which at £ million each cost four times more than standard depots in  sainsburys moved into its current headquarters at holborn london sainsburys previously occupied stamford house and twelve other buildings around southwark however the accounting department remained separate at streatham the building was designed by architectural firm foster and partners and had been developed on the former mirror group site for andersen consulting

conjunction with debenhams barclaycard and bp debenhams and barclaycard have subsequently both left the scheme the nectar scheme replaced the sainsburys reward card accrued points were transferred over in january  wm morrison supermarkets trading as morrisons made an offer for the safeway group prompting a bidding war between the major supermarkets the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt referred the various bids to the competition commission which reported its findings on  september the commission found that all bids with the exception of morrisons would operate against the public interest as part of the approval morrisons was to dispose of fifty three of the combined groups stores in may  sainsburys announced that it would acquire fourteen of these stores thirteen safeway stores and one morrisons outlet located primarily in the midlands and the north of england making sainsburys great again –edit j sainsbury hq in holborn photographed in  the surrounding area has since changed dramatically at the end of march  davis was promoted to chairman and was replaced as ceo by justin king king joined sainsburys in from marks and spencer plc where he was a director with responsibility for its food division and kings super markets inc subsidiary in the united states schooled in solihull near birmingham and a graduate of the university of bath where he took a business administration degree king was also previously a managing director at asda with responsibility for hypermarkets in june  davis was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt over his salary and bonuses investors were angered by a bonus share award of over £ million despite poor company performance on  july  davis replacement philip hampton was appointed as chairman king ordered a direct mail campaign to one million sainsburys customers as part of his sixmonth business review asking them what they wanted from the company and where the company could improve this reaffirmed the commentary of retail analysts – the group was not ensuring that shelves are fully stocked this due to the failure of the it systems introduced by peter davis on  october  king unveiled the results of the business review and his plans to revive the companys fortunes – in a threeyear recovery plan entitled making sainsburys great again this was generally well received by both the stock market and the media immediate plans included laying off headquarters staff over  and the recruitment of around shop floor staff over  to improve the quality of service and the firms main problem stock availability the aim would be to increase sales revenue by £ billion by the financial year ending march  another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality king hired lawrence christensen as supply chain director in  previously he was an expert in logistics at safeway but left following its takeover by morrisons immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres at the time of the business review on  october  referring to the availability problems justin king said lawrence hadnt seen anything that he hadnt seen before he just hadnt seen them all in the same place at the same time in  christensen commented on the four automated depots introduced by davis saying not a single day went by without one if not all of them breaking down the systems were flawed they have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance but because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up it was a vicious circle christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others in  sainsburys announced a further £ million investment in its depots to keep pace with sales growth and the removal of the failed automated systems from its depots in addition it did a deal with ibm to upgrade its electronic – point of sale systems as a result of increased sales sainsburys sold its subsidiary in america shaws to albertsons in march  also in

hampton and the two largest sainsbury family shareholders lord sainsbury of turville and lord sainsbury of preston candover the offer was rejected on  april the indicative offer was raised to p a share however this too was rejected this meant the consortium could not satisfy its own preconditions for a bid most importantly  shareholder support the combined sainsbury family holding at the time

p per share lord sainsbury of preston candover with just under  was more extreme than his cousin and refused to sell at any price he believed any offer at that stage of sainsburys recovery was likely to undervalue the business and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments saw no reason to sell given that the current management led by justin king could deliver the extra profit generated for the benefit of existing investors he claimed the bid brought nothing to the business and that high levels of debt would significantly weaken the company and its competitive position in the long term which would have an adverse effect on sainsburys stakeholders on  april the cvc led consortium abandoned its offer stating it became clear the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer in may  sainsburys identified five areas of growth growth of nonfood ranges opening of new convenience stores and growth of online home delivery and

of kosher productsedit in  a photograph surfaced on twitter showing that the holborn sainsburys franchise responded to antisemitic threats by removing kosher products from its shelves complaints began appearing on social media that removing food that is consistent with jewish dietary restrictions and is produced all over the world was an act of discrimination against jews in response to the

process in march  and agreed a £m deal to buy bristol rovers fc capacity memorial stadium in north bristol and lease it back for a peppercorn rent until the new ground was ready and then redevelop the old stadium as a new store the club hoped the money from the sale would largely finance a new uwe stadium however sainsburys ended up locked in a legal battle with bristol rovers after the supermarket pulled out of the deal sainsburys argued at the high court in london that it was legally entitled to terminate the contract because conditions linked to the agreement had not been satisfied lawyers for the club said that either the contract is still on foot or sainsburys had breached it it was claimed in court that sainsburys had been looking for way out of deal for nearly two years david matthias qc for the club said the proposed sainsburys store had become less financially viable amid a difficult trading climate he said sainsburys saw the restrictions on delivery times as an opportunity to get out of the contract and did nothing from january  to challenge the restrictions and get suitable planning permission the club successfully made its own application to lift the restrictions in december that year sainsburys won its high court battle after judge mrs justice proudman ruled that sainsburys must succeed because the construction of a schedule to the agreement seems like an insuperable barrier to the club winning the case in a statement rovers accused sainsburys of breaking its promises it described the decision as a kick in the teeth for the people of bristol the club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that sainsburys reneged on its promises to the local community to invest in the region and showed a flagrant disregard for the

partnership in  when john james sainsbury and his wife mary ann opened a store at  drury lane in holborn london sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar his trading philosophy as stated on a sign outside his first shop in islington was quality perfect prices lower sainsburys was very innovative in that its stores instead of featuring five ownbrand lines as archrival home and colonial did offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison also instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters sainsburys boasted marble counters mosaic floors and whitetiled walls staff even had a uniform of white aprons stores started to look similar so people could recognise them throughout london a high castiron j sainsbury sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses and roundtheback deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to sainsburys popularity in  j sainsbury was incorporated as a private company as j sainsbury limited when it became the united kingdoms largest grocery group by this time each store had the following departments dairy bacon and hams poultry and game cooked meats and fresh meats groceries were introduced in  when john james purchased a grocers branch at  kingsland high street dalston home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days sites were carefully chosen with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop this allowed a larger display of products which could be kept cooler in summer which was important as there was no refrigeration by the time john james sainsbury died in  there were over  shops his last words were said to be keep the shops well lit he was replaced by his eldest son john benjamin sainsbury who had gone into partnership with his father in  during the s and s with the company now run by john james sainsburys eldest son john benjamin sainsbury the company continued to refine its product offerings and maintain its leadership in terms of store design convenience and cleanliness the company acquired the midlandsbased thoroughgood chain in  alan sainsbury the founders grandson later lord sainsbury of drury lane became joint managing director of sainsburys along with his brother sir robert sainsbury in  after their father john benjamin sainsbury had a minor heart attack following the outbreak of world war ii many of the men who worked for sainsburys were called to perform national service and were replaced by women the second world war was a difficult time for sainsburys as most of its stores were trading in the london area and were bombed or damaged turnover fell to half the prewar level food was rationed and one particular store in east grinstead was so badly damaged on friday  july  that it had to move to the local church temporarily while a new one was built this store was not completed until  selfservice and heyday –edit in  alan sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father john benjamin sainsbury during the s and s sainsburys was a keen early adopter of selfservice supermarkets in the united kingdom the first selfservice store within the country was a cooperative store opened in  on a trip to the united states of america alan sainsbury realised the benefits of selfservice stores and believed the future of sainsburys was selfservice supermarkets of  sq ft  m with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience the first selfservice branch opened in croydon in  sainsburys was a pioneer in the development of ownbrand goods the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but at a lower price it expanded more cautiously than did tesco shunning acquisitions and it never offered trading stamps until the company went public on  july  as j sainsbury plc the company was wholly owned by the sainsbury family it was at the time the largest ever flotation on the london stock exchange the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible a million shares were set aside for staff which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value within one minute the list of applications was closed £ million had been offered for £ million available shares the sainsbury family at the time retained  of the firms shares sainsburys in bradford on avon wiltshire most of the senior positions were held by family members john davan sainsbury later lord sainsbury of preston candover a member of the fourth generation of the founding family took over the chairmanship from his uncle sir robert sainsbury in  who had been chairman for two years from  following alan sainsburys retirement sainsburys started to replace its  sq ft  m high street stores with selfservice supermarkets above  sq ft  m which were either in out of town locations or in regenerated town centres sainsburys policy was to invest in uniform well designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality its slogan was good food costs less at sainsburys during the s the average size of sainsburys stores rose from  sq ft  m to around  sq ft  m the first edge of town store with  sq ft  m of selling space was opened at coldhams lane in cambridge in  the last counter service branch closed in peckham in  to participate in the hypermarket sector sainsburys formed a joint venture known as savacentre with british home stores the first savacentre store was opened in washington tyne and wear in  nearly half the space amounting to some  sq ft  m was devoted to textiles electrical goods and hardware as the hypermarket format became more mainstream with rivals such as asda and tesco launching ever larger stores it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular sainsburys superstore format in september  another diversification took place in  when sainsburys formed a joint venture with the belgian retailer gbinnobm to set up a chain of doityourself stores under the homebase name sainsburys sold the homebase chain in december  in an twofold deal worth £ million sales of the chain of stores to venture capitalist schroder ventures generated £ million and sale of  development sites which had been earmarked for future homebase stores were sold for £ million to rival bqs parent company kingfisher plc in november  sainsburys purchased  of shaws supermarkets the second largest grocery group in the northeastern united states primarily in new england in june  sainsburys acquired the rest of the company with the intention of creating a highquality regional food retailing business based on the same principles as the ukbased operation in  the chairman reported that over the preceding  years profits had grown from £ million to over £ million a compound annual rise of  – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of  during the s the company invested in new technology the proportion of sales passing through epos scanning checkouts rose from  to  with the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the s sainsburys was one of the many big retail names to open new stores in such complexes – notably with its store at the meadowhall shopping centre sheffield originally as a savacentre in  which was converted into a regular sainsbury store in  and was closed in  and the merry hill shopping centre at brierley hill in the west midlands part of an enterprise zone which opened in september  sainsburys expanded its operation into scotland with a store in darnley which opened in january  the savacentre at cameron toll in edinburgh had opened in  in june  sainsburys announced its intention to move into the northern ireland market until that point dominated by local companies between december  and december  the company opened seven stores two others at sprucefield lisburn and holywood exchange belfast would not open until  due to protracted legal challenges sainsburys move into northern ireland was undertaken in a very different way from that of tesco while sainsburys outlets were all new developments tesco apart from one tesco metro instead purchased existing chains from associated british foods see tesco ireland in  the sainsburys group boasted a twelveyear record of dividend increases of  or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long also in  the company raised £ million in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores sainsburys decline –edit the sainsburys supermarket building in greenwich which was nominated for the stirling prize in  and has since been demolished in  the long time ceo john davan sainsbury retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin david sainsbury later lord sainsbury of turville this brought about a change in management style – david was more consensual and less hierarchical but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the companys place in the market mistakes by david sainsbury and his successors dino adriano and peter davis included the rejection of loyalty cards the reluctance to move into nonfood retailing the indecision between whether to go quality or for value the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers which led to suppliers favouring tesco over sainsburys and the unsuccessful john cleese advertising campaign at the end of  it announced price cuts on three hundred of its most popular own label lines significantly this came three months after tesco had launched its line tesco value a few months later sainsburys announced that margins had fallen that the pace of new superstore construction would slow down and that it would write down the value of some of its properties in  sainsburys announced a new town centre format sainsburys central again a response to tescos metro which was already established in five locations also in  sainsburys lost the takeover battle for william low like tesco sainsburys had long been underrepresented in scotland also that year david sainsbury dismissed tescos clubcard initiative as an electronic version of green shield stamps the company was soon forced to backtrack introducing its own reward card eighteen months later for much of the twentieth century sainsburys had been the market leader in the supermarket sector in the united kingdom but in  it lost its place as the countrys largest grocer to tesco some new ventures were successful notably the launch of a retail bank sainsburys bank in partnership with bank of scotland in addition to shaws sainsburys bought a minority stake in another supermarket group giant food based in washington dc although this shareholding was subsequently sold when ahold of the netherlands made a full bid for the company an arrangement in late  with supermarket direct made sainsburys the first major grocery store in the uk to with a home delivery service sainsburys also trebled the size of its homebase do it yourself business during  by merging its business with texas homecare which in january  it acquired from ladbroke for £ million in may  the company reported its first fall in profits for twenty two years david sainsbury announced management changes involving the appointment of two chief executives one in charge of supermarkets within the united kingdom dino adriano and the other responsible for homebase and the united states david bremner finally in  david sainsbury himself resigned from the company to pursue a career in politics he was succeeded as non executive chairman by george bull who had been chairman of diageo and adriano was promoted to be group chief executive the brand relaunch –edit sainsburys logo launched in  in

dropped in may  and replaced in september of that year by try something new today this new brand statement was created by abbott mead vickers bbdo while the interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years the company introduced another informal font in  which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature in  sainsburys acquired an  share of egyptian distribution group sae a retailer in egypt with one hundred stores and  employees however poor profitability led to the sale of this share in april  on  october  the ceo dino adriano lost control of the core supermarket business within the united kingdom instead assuming responsibility for the rest of the group david bremner became head of the supermarkets in the united kingdom this was derided by the city and described as a fudge on  january  sainsburys reversed this decision by announcing the replacement of adriano by sir peter davis effective from march between – sir peter davis was chief executive of sainsburys davis appointment was well received by investors and analysts in his first two years he exceeded profit targets although by  the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the grocery market within the united kingdom davis also oversaw an almost £ billion upgrade of stores distribution and it equipment entitled business transformation programme but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal – improving availability part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots which at £ million each cost four times more than standard depots in  sainsburys moved into its current headquarters at holborn london sainsburys previously occupied stamford house and twelve other buildings around southwark however the accounting department remained separate at streatham the building was designed by architectural firm foster and partners and had been developed on the former mirror group site for andersen consulting now accenture however sainsburys acquired the twenty fiveyear lease when accenture pulled out sainsburys is a founding member of the nectar loyalty card scheme which was launched in september  in conjunction with debenhams barclaycard and bp debenhams and barclaycard have subsequently both left the scheme the nectar scheme replaced the sainsburys reward card accrued points were transferred over in january  wm morrison supermarkets trading as morrisons made an offer for the safeway group prompting a bidding war between the major supermarkets the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt referred the various bids to the competition commission which reported its findings on  september the commission found that all bids with the exception of morrisons would operate against the public interest as part of the approval morrisons was to dispose of fifty three of the combined groups stores in may  sainsburys announced that it would acquire fourteen of these stores thirteen safeway stores and one morrisons outlet located primarily in the midlands and the north of england making sainsburys great again –edit j sainsbury hq in holborn photographed in  the surrounding area has since changed dramatically at the end of march  davis was promoted to chairman and was replaced as ceo by justin king king joined sainsburys in from marks and spencer plc where he was a director with responsibility for its food division and kings super markets inc subsidiary in the united states schooled in solihull near birmingham and a graduate of the university of bath where he took a business administration degree king was also previously a managing director at asda with responsibility for hypermarkets in june  davis was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt over his salary and bonuses investors were angered by a bonus share award of over £ million despite poor company performance on  july  davis replacement philip hampton was appointed as chairman king ordered a direct mail campaign to one million sainsburys customers as part of his sixmonth business review asking them what they wanted from the company and where the company could improve this reaffirmed the commentary of retail analysts – the group was not ensuring that shelves are fully stocked this due to the failure of the it systems introduced by peter davis on  october  king unveiled the results of the business review and his plans to revive the companys fortunes – in a threeyear recovery plan entitled making sainsburys great again this was generally well received by both the stock market and the media immediate plans included laying off headquarters staff over  and the recruitment of around shop floor staff over  to improve the quality of service and the firms main problem stock availability the aim would be to increase sales revenue by £ billion by the financial year ending march  another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality king hired lawrence christensen as supply chain director in  previously he was an expert in logistics at safeway but left following its takeover by morrisons immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres at the time of the business review on  october  referring to the availability problems justin king said lawrence hadnt seen anything that he hadnt seen before he just hadnt seen them all in the same place at the same time in  christensen commented on the four automated depots introduced by davis saying not a single day went by without one if not all of them breaking down the systems were flawed they have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance but because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up it was a vicious circle christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others in  sainsburys announced a further £ million investment in its depots to keep pace with sales growth and the removal of the failed automated systems from its depots in addition it did a deal with ibm to upgrade its electronic – point of sale systems as a result of increased sales sainsburys sold its

consecutive quarters of sales growth most recently in october  early sales increases were credited to solving problems with the companys distribution system more recent sales improvements have been put down to price cuts and the companys focus on fresh and healthy food takeover bids edit on  february  after months of speculation about a private equity bid cvc capital partners kohlberg kravis roberts kkr and blackstone group announced that they were considering a bid for sainsburys the consortium grew to include goldman sachs and texas pacific group on  march  with a formal bid yet to be tabled the takeover panel issued a bid deadline of  april on  april kkr left the consortium to focus on its bid for alliance boots on  april the consortium submitted an indicative offer of p a share to the companys board after discussions between sir philip hampton and the two largest sainsbury family shareholders lord sainsbury of turville and lord sainsbury of preston candover the offer was rejected on  april the indicative offer was raised to p a share however this too was rejected this meant the consortium could not satisfy its own preconditions for a bid most importantly  shareholder support the combined sainsbury family holding at the time was  lord sainsbury of turville who then held  of sainsburys stated that he could see no reason why the sainsburys board would even consider opening its books for due diligence for anything less than p per share lord sainsbury of preston candover with just under  was more extreme than his cousin and refused to sell at any price he believed any offer at that stage of sainsburys recovery was likely to undervalue the business and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments saw no reason to sell given that the current management led by justin king could deliver the extra profit generated for the benefit of existing investors he claimed the bid brought nothing to the business and that high levels of debt would significantly weaken the company and its competitive position in the long term which would have an adverse effect on sainsburys stakeholders on  april the cvc led consortium abandoned its offer stating it became clear the consortium would be unable to make a proposal that would result in a successful offer in may  sainsburys identified five areas of growth growth of nonfood ranges opening of

bristol and lease it back for a peppercorn rent until the new ground was ready and then redevelop the old stadium as a new store the club hoped the money from the sale would largely finance a new uwe stadium however sainsburys ended up locked in a legal battle with bristol rovers after the supermarket pulled out of the deal sainsburys argued at the high court in london that it was legally entitled to terminate the contract because conditions linked to the agreement had not been satisfied lawyers for the club said that either the contract is still on foot or sainsburys had breached it it was claimed in court that sainsburys had been looking for way out of deal for nearly two years david matthias qc for the club said the proposed sainsburys store had become less financially viable amid a difficult trading climate he said sainsburys saw the restrictions on delivery times as an opportunity to get out of the contract and did nothing from january  to challenge the restrictions and get suitable planning permission the club successfully made its own application to lift the restrictions in december that year sainsburys won its high court battle after judge mrs justice proudman ruled that sainsburys must succeed because the construction of a schedule to the agreement seems like an insuperable barrier to the club winning the case in a statement rovers accused sainsburys of breaking its promises it described the decision as a kick in the teeth for the people of bristol the club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that sainsburys reneged on its promises to the

partnership in  when john james sainsbury and his wife mary ann opened a store at  drury lane in holborn london sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar his trading philosophy as stated on a sign outside his first shop in islington was quality perfect prices lower sainsburys was very innovative in that its stores instead of featuring five ownbrand lines as archrival home and colonial did offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison also instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters sainsburys boasted marble counters mosaic floors and whitetiled walls staff even had a uniform of white aprons stores started to look similar so people could recognise them throughout london a high castiron j sainsbury sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses and roundtheback deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to sainsburys popularity in  j sainsbury was incorporated as a private company as j sainsbury limited when it became the united kingdoms largest grocery group by this time each store had the following departments dairy bacon and hams poultry and game cooked meats and fresh meats groceries were introduced in  when john james purchased a grocers branch at  kingsland high street dalston home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days sites were carefully chosen with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop this allowed a larger display of products which could be kept cooler in summer which was important as there was no refrigeration by the time john james sainsbury died in  there were over  shops his last words were said to be keep the shops well lit he was replaced by his eldest son john benjamin sainsbury who had gone into partnership with his father in  during the s and s with the company now run by john james sainsburys eldest son john benjamin sainsbury the company continued to refine its product offerings and maintain its leadership in terms of store design convenience and cleanliness the company acquired the midlandsbased thoroughgood chain in  alan sainsbury the founders grandson later lord sainsbury of drury lane became joint managing director of sainsburys along with his brother sir robert sainsbury in  after their father john benjamin sainsbury had a minor heart attack following the outbreak of world war ii many of the men who worked for sainsburys were called to perform national service and were replaced by women the second world war was a difficult time for sainsburys as most of its stores were trading in the london area and were bombed or damaged turnover fell to half the prewar level food was rationed and one particular store in east grinstead was so badly damaged on friday  july  that it had to move to the local church temporarily while a new one was built this store was not completed until  selfservice and heyday –edit in  alan sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father john benjamin sainsbury during the s and s sainsburys was a keen early adopter of selfservice supermarkets in the united kingdom the first selfservice store within the country was a cooperative store opened in  on a trip to the united states of america alan sainsbury realised the benefits of selfservice stores and believed the future of sainsburys was selfservice supermarkets of  sq ft  m with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience the first selfservice branch opened in croydon in  sainsburys was a pioneer in the development of ownbrand goods the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but at a lower price it expanded more cautiously than did tesco shunning acquisitions and it never offered trading stamps until the company went public on  july  as j sainsbury plc the company was wholly owned by the sainsbury family it was at the time the largest ever flotation on the london stock exchange the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible a million shares were set aside for staff which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value within one minute the list of applications was closed £ million had been offered for £ million available shares the sainsbury family at the time retained  of the firms shares sainsburys in bradford on avon wiltshire most of the senior positions were held by family members john davan sainsbury later lord sainsbury of preston candover a member of the fourth generation of the founding family took over the chairmanship from his uncle sir robert sainsbury in  who had been chairman for two years from  following alan sainsburys retirement sainsburys started to replace its  sq ft  m high street stores with selfservice supermarkets above  sq ft  m which were either in out of town locations or in regenerated town centres sainsburys policy was to invest in uniform well designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality its slogan was good food costs less at sainsburys during the s the average size of sainsburys stores rose from  sq ft  m to around  sq ft  m the first edge of town store with  sq ft  m of selling space was opened at coldhams lane in cambridge in  the last counter service branch closed in peckham in  to participate in the hypermarket sector sainsburys formed a joint venture known as savacentre with british home stores the first savacentre store was opened in washington tyne and wear in  nearly half the space amounting to some  sq ft  m was devoted to textiles electrical goods and hardware as the hypermarket format became more mainstream with rivals such as asda and tesco launching ever larger stores it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular sainsburys superstore format in september  another diversification took place in  when sainsburys formed a joint venture with the belgian retailer gbinnobm to set up a chain of doityourself stores under the homebase name sainsburys sold the homebase chain in december  in an twofold deal worth £ million sales of the chain of stores to venture capitalist schroder ventures generated £ million and sale of  development sites which had been earmarked for future homebase stores were sold for £ million to rival bqs parent company kingfisher plc in november  sainsburys purchased  of shaws supermarkets the second largest grocery group in the northeastern united states primarily in new england in june  sainsburys acquired the rest of the company with the intention of creating a highquality regional food retailing business based on the same principles as the ukbased operation in  the chairman reported that over the preceding  years profits had grown from £ million to over £ million a compound annual rise of  – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of  during the s the company invested in new technology the proportion of sales passing through epos scanning checkouts rose from  to  with the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the s sainsburys was one of the many big retail names to open new stores in such complexes – notably with its store at the meadowhall shopping centre sheffield originally as a savacentre in  which was converted into a regular sainsbury store in  and was closed in  and the merry hill shopping centre at brierley hill in the west midlands part of an enterprise zone which opened in september  sainsburys expanded its operation into scotland with a store in darnley which opened in january  the savacentre at cameron toll in edinburgh had opened in  in june  sainsburys announced its intention to move into the northern ireland market until that point dominated by local companies between december  and december  the company opened seven stores two others at sprucefield lisburn and holywood exchange belfast would not open until  due to protracted legal challenges sainsburys move into northern ireland was undertaken in a very different way from that of tesco while sainsburys outlets were all new developments tesco apart from one tesco metro instead purchased existing chains from associated british foods see tesco ireland in  the sainsburys group boasted a twelveyear record of dividend increases of  or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long also in  the company raised £ million in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores sainsburys decline –edit the sainsburys supermarket building in greenwich which was nominated for the stirling prize in  and has since been demolished in  the long time ceo john davan sainsbury retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin david sainsbury later lord sainsbury of turville this brought about a change in management style – david was more consensual and less hierarchical but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the companys place in the market mistakes by david sainsbury and his successors dino adriano and peter davis included the rejection of loyalty cards the reluctance to move into nonfood retailing the indecision between whether to go quality or for value the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers which led to suppliers favouring tesco over sainsburys and the unsuccessful john cleese advertising campaign at the end of  it announced price cuts on three hundred of its most popular own label lines significantly this came three months after tesco had launched its line tesco value a few months later sainsburys announced that margins had fallen that the pace of new superstore construction would slow down and that it would write down the value of some of its properties in  sainsburys announced a new town centre format sainsburys central again a response to tescos metro which was already established in five locations also in  sainsburys lost the takeover battle for william low like tesco sainsburys had long been underrepresented in scotland also that year david sainsbury dismissed tescos clubcard initiative as an electronic version of green shield stamps the company was soon forced to backtrack introducing its own reward card eighteen months later for much of the twentieth century sainsburys had been the market leader in the supermarket sector in the united kingdom but in  it lost its place as the countrys largest grocer to tesco some new ventures were successful notably the launch of a retail bank sainsburys bank in partnership with bank of scotland in addition to shaws sainsburys bought a minority stake in another supermarket group giant food based in washington dc although this shareholding was subsequently sold when ahold of the netherlands made a full bid for the company an arrangement in late  with supermarket direct made sainsburys the first major grocery store in the uk to with a home delivery service sainsburys also trebled the size of its homebase do it yourself business during  by merging its business with texas homecare which in january  it acquired from ladbroke for £ million in may  the company reported its first fall in profits for twenty two years david sainsbury announced management changes involving the appointment of two chief executives one in charge of supermarkets within the united kingdom dino adriano and the other responsible for homebase and the united states david bremner finally in  david sainsbury himself resigned from the company to pursue a career in politics he was succeeded as non executive chairman by george bull who had been chairman of diageo and adriano was promoted to be group chief executive the brand relaunch –edit sainsburys logo launched in  in june  sainsburys unveiled its new corporate identity which was developed by mc saatchi which consisted of the current company logo new corporate colours of living orange and blue interstate as the companys new general use lowercase font from the old all uppercase font the new slogan making life taste better which replaced its old slogan from the s and new staff uniforms the strapline was dropped in may  and replaced in september of that year by try something new today this new brand statement was created by abbott mead vickers bbdo while the interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years the company introduced another informal font in  which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature in  sainsburys acquired an  share of egyptian distribution group sae a retailer in egypt with one hundred stores and  employees however poor profitability led to the sale of this share in april  on  october  the ceo dino adriano lost control of the core supermarket business within the united kingdom instead assuming responsibility for the rest of the group david bremner became head of the supermarkets in the united kingdom this was derided by the city and described as a fudge on  january  sainsburys reversed this decision by announcing the replacement of adriano by sir peter davis effective from march between – sir peter davis was chief executive of sainsburys davis appointment was well received by investors and analysts in his first two years he exceeded profit targets although by  the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the grocery market within the united kingdom davis also oversaw an almost £ billion upgrade of stores distribution and it equipment entitled business transformation programme but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal – improving availability part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots which at £ million each cost four times more than standard depots in  sainsburys moved into its current headquarters at holborn london sainsburys previously occupied stamford house and twelve other buildings around southwark however the accounting department remained separate at streatham the building was designed by architectural firm foster and partners and had been developed on the former mirror group site for andersen consulting now accenture however sainsburys acquired the twenty fiveyear lease when accenture pulled out sainsburys is a founding member of the nectar loyalty card scheme which was launched in september  in conjunction with debenhams barclaycard and bp debenhams and barclaycard have subsequently both left the scheme the nectar scheme replaced the sainsburys reward card accrued points were transferred over in january  wm morrison supermarkets trading as morrisons made an offer for the safeway group prompting a bidding war between the major supermarkets the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt referred the various bids to the competition commission which reported its findings on  september the commission found that all bids with the exception of morrisons would operate against the public interest as part of the approval morrisons was to dispose of fifty three of the combined groups stores in may  sainsburys announced that it would acquire fourteen of these stores thirteen safeway stores and one morrisons outlet located primarily in the midlands and the north of england making sainsburys great again –edit j sainsbury hq in holborn photographed in  the surrounding area has since changed dramatically at the end of march  davis was promoted to chairman and was replaced as ceo by justin king king joined sainsburys in from marks and spencer plc where he was a director with responsibility for its food division and kings super markets inc subsidiary in the united states schooled in solihull near birmingham and a graduate of the university of bath where he took a business administration degree king was also previously a managing director at asda with responsibility for hypermarkets in june  davis was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt over his salary and bonuses investors were angered by a bonus share award of over £ million despite poor company performance on  july  davis replacement philip hampton was appointed as chairman king ordered a direct mail campaign to one million sainsburys customers as part of his sixmonth business review asking them what they wanted from the company and where the company could improve this reaffirmed the commentary of retail analysts – the group was not ensuring that shelves are fully stocked this due to the failure of the it systems introduced by peter davis on  october  king unveiled the results of the business review and his plans to revive the companys fortunes – in a threeyear recovery plan entitled making sainsburys great again this was generally well received by both the stock market and the media immediate plans included laying off headquarters staff over  and the recruitment of around shop floor staff over  to improve the quality of service and the firms main problem stock availability the aim would be to increase sales revenue by £ billion by the financial year ending march  another significant announcement was the halving of the dividend to increase funds available for price cuts and quality king hired lawrence christensen as supply chain director in  previously he was an expert in logistics at safeway but left following its takeover by morrisons immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres at the time of the business review on  october  referring to the availability problems justin king said lawrence hadnt seen anything that he hadnt seen before he just hadnt seen them all in the same place at the same time in  christensen commented on the four automated depots introduced by davis saying not a single day went by without one if not all of them breaking down the systems were flawed they have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance but because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up it was a vicious circle christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others in  sainsburys announced a further £ million investment in its depots to keep pace with sales growth and the removal of the failed automated systems from its depots in addition it did a deal with ibm to upgrade its electronic – point of sale systems as a result of increased sales sainsburys sold its subsidiary in america shaws to albertsons in march  also in  sainsburys expanded its share of the convenience store market through acquisitions bells stores a fifty four store chain based in north east england was acquired in february  jacksons stores a chain of one hundred and fourteen stores based in yorkshire and the north midlands was purchased in august  jb beaumont a chain of six stores in the east midlands was acquired in november  sl shaw ltd which owned six stores was acquired on  april  for £ million since the launch of kings recovery programme the company has reported nineteen consecutive quarters of sales growth most recently in october  early sales increases were credited to solving problems with the companys distribution system more recent sales improvements have been put down to price cuts and the companys focus on fresh and healthy food takeover bids edit on  february  after months of speculation about a private equity bid cvc capital partners kohlberg kravis roberts kkr and blackstone group announced that they were considering a bid for sainsburys the consortium grew to include goldman sachs and texas pacific group on  march  with a formal bid yet to be tabled the takeover panel issued a bid deadline of  april on  april kkr left the consortium to focus on its bid for alliance boots on  april the consortium submitted an indicative offer of p a share to the companys board after discussions between sir philip hampton and the two largest sainsbury family shareholders lord sainsbury of turville and lord sainsbury of preston candover the offer was rejected on  april the indicative offer was raised to p a share however this too was rejected this meant the consortium could not satisfy its own preconditions for a bid most importantly  shareholder support the combined sainsbury family holding at the time was  lord sainsbury of turville who then held  of sainsburys stated that he could see no reason why the sainsburys board would even consider opening its books for due diligence for anything less than p per share lord sainsbury of preston candover with just under  was more extreme than his cousin and refused to sell at any price he believed any offer at that stage of sainsburys recovery was likely to undervalue the business and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments saw no reason to sell given that the current

to terminate the contract because conditions linked to the agreement had not been satisfied lawyers for the club said that either the contract is still on foot or sainsburys had breached it it was claimed in court that sainsburys had been looking for way out of deal for nearly two years david matthias qc for the club said the proposed sainsburys store had become less financially viable amid a difficult trading climate he said sainsburys saw the restrictions on delivery times as an opportunity to get out of the contract and did nothing from january  to challenge the restrictions and get suitable planning permission the club successfully made its own application to lift the restrictions in december that year sainsburys won its high court battle after judge mrs justice proudman ruled that sainsburys must succeed because the construction of a schedule to the agreement seems like an insuperable barrier to the club winning the case in a statement rovers accused sainsburys of breaking

partnership in  when john james sainsbury and his wife mary ann opened a store at  drury lane in holborn london sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar his trading philosophy as stated on a sign outside his first shop in islington was quality perfect prices lower sainsburys was very innovative in that its stores instead of featuring five ownbrand lines as archrival home and colonial did offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison also instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters sainsburys boasted marble counters mosaic floors and whitetiled walls staff even had a uniform of white aprons stores started to look similar so people could recognise them throughout london a high castiron j sainsbury sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses and roundtheback deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to sainsburys popularity in  j sainsbury was incorporated as a private company as j sainsbury limited when it became the united kingdoms largest grocery group by this time each store had the following departments dairy bacon and hams poultry and game cooked meats and fresh meats groceries were introduced in  when john james purchased a grocers branch at  kingsland high street dalston home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days sites were carefully chosen with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop this allowed a larger display of products which could be kept cooler in summer which was important as there was no refrigeration by the time john james sainsbury died in  there were over  shops his last words were said to be keep the shops well lit he was replaced by his eldest son john benjamin sainsbury who had gone into partnership with his father in  during the s and s with the company now run by john james sainsburys eldest son john benjamin sainsbury the company continued to refine its product offerings and maintain its leadership in terms of store design convenience and cleanliness the company acquired the midlandsbased thoroughgood chain in  alan sainsbury the founders grandson later lord sainsbury of drury lane became joint managing director of sainsburys along with his brother sir robert sainsbury in  after their father john benjamin sainsbury had a minor heart attack following the outbreak of world war ii many of the men who worked for sainsburys were called to perform national service and were replaced by women the second world war was a difficult time for sainsburys as most of its stores were trading in the london area and were bombed or damaged turnover fell to half the prewar level food was rationed and one particular store in east grinstead was so badly damaged on friday  july  that it had to move to the local church temporarily while a new one was built this store was not completed until  selfservice and heyday –edit in  alan sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father john benjamin sainsbury during the s and s sainsburys was a keen early adopter of selfservice supermarkets in the united kingdom the first selfservice store within the country was a cooperative store opened in  on a trip to the united states of america alan sainsbury realised the benefits of selfservice stores and believed the future of sainsburys was selfservice supermarkets of  sq ft  m with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience the first selfservice branch opened in croydon in  sainsburys was a pioneer in the development of ownbrand goods the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but at a lower price it expanded more cautiously than did tesco shunning acquisitions and it never offered trading stamps until the company went public on  july  as j sainsbury plc the company was wholly owned by the sainsbury family it was at the time the largest ever flotation on the london stock exchange the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible a million shares were set aside for staff which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value within one minute the list of applications was closed £ million had been offered for £ million available shares the sainsbury family at the time retained  of the firms shares sainsburys in bradford on avon wiltshire most of the senior positions were held by family members john davan sainsbury later lord sainsbury of preston candover a member of the fourth generation of the founding family took over the chairmanship from his uncle sir robert sainsbury in  who had been chairman for two years from  following alan sainsburys retirement sainsburys started to replace its  sq ft  m high street stores with selfservice supermarkets above  sq ft  m which were either in out of town locations or in regenerated town centres sainsburys policy was to invest in uniform well designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality its slogan was good food costs less at sainsburys during the s the average size of sainsburys stores rose from  sq ft  m to around  sq ft  m the first edge of town store with  sq ft  m of selling space was opened at coldhams lane in cambridge in  the last counter service branch closed in peckham in  to participate in the hypermarket sector sainsburys formed a joint venture known as savacentre with british home stores the first savacentre store was opened in washington tyne and wear in  nearly half the space amounting to some  sq ft  m was devoted to textiles electrical goods and hardware as the hypermarket format became more mainstream with rivals such as asda and tesco launching ever larger stores it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular sainsburys superstore format in september  another diversification took place in  when sainsburys formed a joint venture with the belgian retailer gbinnobm to set up a chain of doityourself stores under the homebase name sainsburys sold the homebase chain in december  in an twofold deal worth £ million sales of the chain of stores to venture capitalist schroder ventures generated £ million and sale of  development sites which had been earmarked for future homebase stores were sold for £ million to rival bqs parent company kingfisher plc in november  sainsburys purchased  of shaws supermarkets the second largest grocery group in the northeastern united states primarily in new england in june  sainsburys acquired the rest of the company with the intention of creating a highquality regional food retailing business based on the same principles as the ukbased operation in  the chairman reported that over the preceding  years profits had grown from £ million to over £ million a compound annual rise of  – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of  during the s the company invested in new technology the proportion of sales passing through epos scanning checkouts rose from  to  with the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the s sainsburys was one of the many big retail names to open new stores in such complexes – notably with its store at the meadowhall shopping centre sheffield originally as a savacentre in  which was converted into a regular sainsbury store in  and was closed in  and the merry hill shopping centre at brierley hill in the west midlands part of an enterprise zone which opened in september  sainsburys expanded its operation into scotland with a store in darnley which opened in january  the savacentre at cameron toll in edinburgh had opened in  in june  sainsburys announced its intention to move into the northern ireland market until that point dominated by local companies between december  and december  the company opened seven stores two others at sprucefield lisburn and holywood exchange belfast would not open until  due to protracted legal challenges sainsburys move into northern ireland was undertaken in a very different way from that of tesco while sainsburys outlets were all new developments tesco apart from one tesco metro instead purchased existing chains from associated british foods see tesco ireland in  the sainsburys group boasted a twelveyear record of dividend increases of  or more and earnings per share had risen by as much for nearly as long also in  the company raised £ million in new equity to fund the expansion of superstores sainsburys decline –edit the sainsburys supermarket building in greenwich which was nominated for the stirling prize in  and has since been demolished in  the long time ceo john davan sainsbury retired and was succeeded as chairman and chief executive by his cousin david sainsbury later lord sainsbury of turville this brought about a change in management style – david was more consensual and less hierarchical but not in strategy or in corporate beliefs about the companys place in the market mistakes by david sainsbury and his successors dino adriano and peter davis included the rejection of loyalty cards the reluctance to move into nonfood retailing the indecision between whether to go quality or for value the sometimes brutal treatment of suppliers which led to suppliers favouring tesco over sainsburys and the unsuccessful john cleese advertising campaign at the end of  it announced price cuts on three hundred of its most popular own label lines significantly this came three months after tesco had launched its line tesco value a few months later sainsburys announced that margins had fallen that the pace of new superstore construction would slow down and that it would write down the value of some of its properties in  sainsburys announced a new town centre format sainsburys central again a response to tescos metro which was already established in five locations also in  sainsburys lost the takeover battle for william low like tesco sainsburys had long been underrepresented in scotland also that year david sainsbury dismissed tescos clubcard initiative as an electronic version of green shield stamps the company was soon forced to backtrack introducing its own reward card eighteen months later for much of the twentieth century sainsburys had been the market leader in the supermarket sector in the united kingdom but in  it lost its place as the countrys largest grocer to tesco some new ventures were successful notably the launch of a retail bank sainsburys bank in partnership with bank of scotland in addition to shaws sainsburys bought a minority stake in another supermarket group giant food based in washington dc although this shareholding was subsequently sold when ahold of the netherlands made a full bid for the company an arrangement in late  with supermarket direct made sainsburys the first major grocery store in the uk to with a home delivery service sainsburys also trebled the size of its homebase do it yourself business during  by merging its business with texas homecare which in january  it acquired from ladbroke for £ million in may  the company reported its first fall in profits for twenty two years david sainsbury announced management changes involving the appointment of two chief executives one in charge of supermarkets within the united kingdom dino adriano and the other responsible for homebase and the united states david bremner finally in  david sainsbury himself resigned from the company to pursue a career in politics he was succeeded as non executive chairman by george bull who had been chairman of diageo and adriano was promoted to be group chief executive the brand relaunch –edit sainsburys logo launched in  in june  sainsburys unveiled its new corporate identity which was developed by mc saatchi which consisted of the current company logo new corporate colours of living orange and blue interstate as the companys new general use lowercase font from the old all uppercase font the new slogan making life taste better which replaced its old slogan from the s and new staff uniforms the strapline was dropped in may  and replaced in september of that year by try something new today this new brand statement was created by abbott mead vickers bbdo while the interstate font was used almost exclusively for many years the company introduced another informal font in  which is used in a wide range of advertising and literature in  sainsburys acquired an  share of egyptian distribution group sae a retailer in egypt with one hundred stores and  employees however poor profitability led to the sale of this share in april  on  october  the ceo dino adriano lost control of the core supermarket business within the united kingdom instead assuming responsibility for the rest of the group david bremner became head of the supermarkets in the united kingdom this was derided by the city and described as a fudge on  january  sainsburys reversed this decision by announcing the replacement of adriano by sir peter davis effective from march between – sir peter davis was chief executive of sainsburys davis appointment was well received by investors and analysts in his first two years he exceeded profit targets although by  the group had suffered a decline in performance relative to its competitors and was demoted to third in the grocery market within the united kingdom davis also oversaw an almost £ billion upgrade of stores distribution and it equipment entitled business transformation programme but his successor would later reveal that much of this investment was wasted and he failed in his key goal – improving availability part of this investment saw the construction of four fully automated depots which at £ million each cost four times more than standard depots in  sainsburys moved into its current headquarters at holborn london sainsburys previously occupied stamford house and twelve other buildings around southwark however the accounting department remained separate at streatham the building was designed by architectural firm foster and partners

partnership in  when john james sainsbury and his wife mary ann opened a store at  drury lane in holborn london sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar his trading philosophy as stated on a sign outside his first shop in islington was quality perfect prices lower sainsburys was very innovative in that its stores instead of featuring five ownbrand lines as archrival home and colonial did offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison also instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters sainsburys boasted marble counters mosaic floors and whitetiled walls staff even had a uniform of white aprons stores started to look similar so people could recognise them throughout london a high castiron j sainsbury sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses and roundtheback deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to sainsburys popularity in  j sainsbury was incorporated as a private company as j sainsbury limited when it became the united kingdoms largest grocery group by this time each store had the following departments dairy bacon and hams poultry and game cooked meats and fresh meats groceries were introduced in  when john james purchased a grocers branch at  kingsland high street dalston home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days sites were carefully chosen with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop this allowed a larger display of products which could be kept cooler in summer which was important as there was no refrigeration by the time john james sainsbury died in  there were over  shops his last words were said to be keep the shops well lit he was replaced by his eldest son john benjamin sainsbury who had gone into partnership with his father in  during the s and s with the company now run by john james sainsburys eldest son john benjamin sainsbury the company continued to refine its product offerings and maintain its leadership in terms of store design convenience and cleanliness the company acquired the midlandsbased thoroughgood chain in  alan sainsbury the founders grandson later lord sainsbury of drury lane became joint managing director of sainsburys along with his brother sir robert sainsbury in  after their father john benjamin sainsbury had a minor heart attack following the outbreak of world war ii many of the men who worked for sainsburys were called to perform national service and were replaced by women the second world war was a difficult time for sainsburys as most of its stores were trading in the london area and were bombed or damaged turnover fell to half the prewar level food was rationed and one particular store in east grinstead was so badly damaged on friday  july  that it had to move to the local church temporarily while a new one was built this store was not completed until  selfservice and heyday –edit in  alan sainsbury became chairman after the death of his father john benjamin sainsbury during the s and s sainsburys was a keen early adopter of selfservice supermarkets in the united kingdom the first selfservice store within the country was a cooperative store opened in  on a trip to the united states of america alan sainsbury realised the benefits of selfservice stores and believed the future of sainsburys was selfservice supermarkets of  sq ft  m with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience the first selfservice branch opened in croydon in  sainsburys was a pioneer in the development of ownbrand goods the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but at a lower price it expanded more cautiously than did tesco shunning acquisitions and it never offered trading stamps until the company went public on  july  as j sainsbury plc the company was wholly owned by the sainsbury family it was at the time the largest ever flotation on the london stock exchange the company rewarded the smaller bids for shares in order to create as many shareholders as possible a million shares were set aside for staff which led to many staff members buying shares that shot up in value within one minute the list of applications was closed £ million had been offered for £ million available shares the sainsbury family at the time retained  of the firms shares sainsburys in bradford on avon wiltshire most of the senior positions were held by family members john davan sainsbury later lord sainsbury of preston candover a member of the fourth generation of the founding family took over the chairmanship from his uncle sir robert sainsbury in  who had been chairman for two years from  following alan sainsburys retirement sainsburys started to replace its  sq ft  m high street stores with selfservice supermarkets above  sq ft  m which were either in out of town locations or in regenerated town centres sainsburys policy was to invest in uniform well designed stores with a strong emphasis on quality its slogan was good food costs less at sainsburys during the s the average size of sainsburys stores rose from  sq ft  m to around  sq ft  m the first edge of town store with  sq ft  m of selling space was opened at coldhams lane in cambridge in  the last counter service branch closed in peckham in  to participate in the hypermarket sector sainsburys formed a joint venture known as savacentre with british home stores the first savacentre store was opened in washington tyne and wear in  nearly half the space amounting to some  sq ft  m was devoted to textiles electrical goods and hardware as the hypermarket format became more mainstream with rivals such as asda and tesco launching ever larger stores it was decided that a separate brand was no longer needed and the stores were converted to the regular sainsburys superstore format in september  another diversification took place in  when sainsburys formed a joint venture with the belgian retailer gbinnobm to set up a chain of doityourself stores under the homebase name sainsburys sold the homebase chain in december  in an twofold deal worth £ million sales of the chain of stores to venture capitalist schroder ventures generated £ million and sale of  development sites which had been earmarked for future homebase stores were sold for £ million to rival bqs parent company kingfisher plc in november  sainsburys purchased  of shaws supermarkets the second largest grocery group in the northeastern united states primarily in new england in june  sainsburys acquired the rest of the company with the intention of creating a highquality regional food retailing business based on the same principles as the ukbased operation in  the chairman reported that over the preceding  years profits had grown from £ million to over £ million a compound annual rise of  – after allowing for inflation a real annual growth rate of  during the s the company invested in new technology the proportion of sales passing through epos scanning checkouts rose from  to  with the advent of out of town shopping complexes during the s sainsburys was one of the many big retail names to open new stores in such complexes – notably with its store at the meadowhall shopping centre sheffield originally as a savacentre in  which was converted into a regular sainsbury store in  and was closed in  and the merry hill shopping centre at brierley hill in the west midlands part of an enterprise zone which opened in september  sainsburys expanded its operation into scotland with a store in darnley which opened in january  the savacentre at cameron toll in edinburgh had opened in  in june  sainsburys announced its intention to move into the

staff were not correctly trained to carry out their duties involving food safety removal of kosher productsedit in  a photograph surfaced on twitter showing that the holborn sainsburys franchise responded to antisemitic threats by removing kosher products from its shelves complaints began appearing on social media that removing food that is consistent with jewish dietary restrictions and is produced all over the world was an act of discrimination against jews in response to the negative publicity the kosher products were restored to the shelves and the staffer who removed them was

bristol and lease it back for a peppercorn rent until the new ground was ready and then redevelop the old stadium as a new store the club hoped the money from the sale would largely finance a new uwe stadium however sainsburys ended up locked in a legal battle with bristol rovers after the supermarket pulled out of the deal sainsburys argued at the high court in london that it was legally entitled to terminate the contract because conditions linked to the agreement had not been satisfied lawyers for the club said that either the contract is still on foot or sainsburys had breached it it was claimed in court that sainsburys had been looking for way out of deal for nearly two years david matthias qc for the club said the proposed sainsburys store had become less financially viable amid a difficult trading climate he said sainsburys saw the restrictions on delivery times as an opportunity to get out of the contract and did nothing from january  to challenge the restrictions and get suitable planning permission the club successfully made its own application to lift the restrictions in december that year sainsburys won its high court battle after judge mrs justice proudman ruled that sainsburys must succeed because the construction of a schedule to the agreement seems like an insuperable barrier to the club winning the case in a statement rovers accused sainsburys of breaking its promises it described the decision as a kick in the teeth for the people of bristol the club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that sainsburys reneged on its promises to the local community to invest in the region and showed a flagrant disregard for the terms of the contract archiveedit sainsburys archive of over  items relating to the business since its foundation is now

partnership in  when john james sainsbury and his wife mary ann opened a store at  drury lane in holborn london sainsbury started as a retailer of fresh foods and later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar his trading philosophy as stated on a sign outside his first shop in islington was quality perfect prices lower sainsburys was very innovative in that its stores instead of featuring five ownbrand lines as archrival home and colonial did offered a wide range of own label lines in comparison also instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters sainsburys boasted marble counters mosaic floors and whitetiled walls staff even had a uniform of white aprons stores started to look similar so people could recognise them throughout london a high castiron j sainsbury sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses and roundtheback deliveries started to add extra convenience and not upset rivals due to sainsburys popularity in  j sainsbury was incorporated as a private company as j sainsbury limited when it became the united kingdoms largest grocery group by this time each store had the following departments dairy bacon and hams poultry and game cooked meats and fresh meats groceries were introduced in  when john james purchased a grocers branch at  kingsland high street dalston home delivery featured in every store as there were fewer cars in those days sites were carefully chosen with a central position in a parade selected in preference to a corner shop this allowed a larger display of products which could be

bristol and lease it back for a peppercorn rent until the new ground was ready and then redevelop the old stadium as a new store the club hoped the money from the sale would largely finance a new uwe stadium however sainsburys ended up locked in a legal battle with bristol rovers after the supermarket pulled out of the deal sainsburys argued at the high court in london that it was legally entitled to terminate the contract because conditions linked to the agreement had not been satisfied lawyers for the club said that either the contract is still on foot or sainsburys had breached it it was claimed in court that sainsburys had been looking for way out of deal for nearly two years david matthias qc for the club said the proposed sainsburys store had become less financially viable amid a difficult trading climate he said sainsburys saw the restrictions on delivery times as an opportunity to get out of the contract and did nothing from january  to challenge the restrictions and get suitable planning permission the club successfully made its own application to lift the restrictions in december that year sainsburys won its high court battle after judge mrs justice proudman ruled that sainsburys must succeed because the construction of a schedule to the agreement seems like an insuperable barrier to the club winning the case in a statement rovers accused sainsburys of breaking its promises it described the decision as a kick in the teeth for the people of bristol the club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that sainsburys reneged on its promises to the local community to invest in the region and showed a flagrant disregard for the terms of the contract archiveedit sainsburys archive of over  items relating to the business since its foundation is now

have read and agree to the terms of use and the privacy policy but one of the most recognisable uk supermarket brand is investing more time and money into its customerfacing technology to improve shopping journeys jon rudoe heads up it as the digital and technology director at sainsbury’s and he believes these two responsibilities coming together create exciting propositions for sainsbury’s customers  “if you go back  years technology was obviously very important to retailers but it wasn’t technology touched directly by consumers” says rudoe “it had a huge part to play in the tills and systems that put stock on the shelves and while those things are hugely influencing customers they’re not directly touched by them” rudoe continues to explain that in recent years the biggest thing that has changed the retail industry – and many other industries – is the move towards digital technology for customers “that probably started with selfservice checkouts and online retail but now it’s the mobile space with applications but even things like crm technology interacts very closely with customers” and this is the reason more and more companies are beginning to fuse their digital and technology teams “when you talk about our company strategy about being there for our customers that’s not just physically but it also means being there for them on their phones and able to deliver the brand and business where they are – in their pocket” application development more on sainsbury’s sainsbury’s appoints digital and technology director sainsbury’s prepares for challenging years ahead as sales drop online sales hit £bn as sainsburys seeks multichannel success in order to create those customercentric technologies sainsbury’s has had to harness the necessary skills through inhouse development as well as contractors suppliers and startups but it is currently looking for people to join its technology and digital team which varies from people with very traditional big infrastructure service roles to user experience and the entertainment team “the industry has evolved so it’s increasingly hard to separate those two things” he says rudoe heads up a team of hundreds whose jobs touch on technology in some way “technology is very embedded and perhaps one of the reasons we haven’t talked about how exciting that technology is is because it’s quite normal for us” rudoe was promoted to the role of head of digital and technology in february after helping to build up sainsbury’s online presence and before that he spent five years working for online supermarket ocado “i remember coming home to a bbc micro as a kid – that’s one of my first memories” says rudoe who has since shaped out a career in how technology and analytics affects business “it’s not just thinking about it as being systems with lights on but about being technology that makes a business impact” and one of the technologies rudoe hopes will make a business impact is sainsbury’s mobile shopping application which is currently being trailed the app will allow customers to create shopping lists which can be used to navigate the shop and to scan goods as they are placed in the basket it will also enable the device to be used to pay for goods to avoid checkout queues at the time of the interview rudoe says his team was in a store in south london trying out the application   “now we’ve actually been working on that for a while we started with a mobile scanandgo product which enabled you to go around the store and scan products pay on the phone get a receipt and walk out” he says “now the next iteration is to create a list wherever you are searching for products on the phone or scanning products in your kitchen – real digitising shopping” rudoe explains that once the shopping list is created you can take your smartphone into a store and shop from the list on the app which deletes off items as you scan them into your basket “something like  of our customers create a shopping list before they go to the supermarket” he says “so we’re not working on something on the periphery of our business – we’re digitising the heart of the journey” rudoe says the team has taken an agile approach to developing the app iterating as they go along “it’s not the kind of product you can write on a piece of paper and predict everything because it’s not really something that’s been done in that form before” he says the app which was created through a mix of inhouse skills and outside development will be tested with nectar cardholders sometime after christmas and will continue to evolve “we’ll release it we’ll iterate it and we’re release it some more” he says “across an organisation as diverse and big as us we’re going to have a wide variety of ways in which we want to do things” he says “some areas we will want to buy a system that already exists and do nothing more than plug it in but in this area there aren’t a lot of known solutions out there so we’ve taken the approach that we want to be much more involved with the development of that product which is why we want to build more of an inhouse development capability” the other digital development rudoe is proud of is the recent christmas preordering site which is an html responsive website allowings customers to preorder their christmas produce “it’s only taken us a few months to develop and it’s a very simple site” he says more on retail it retails digital future retail technology – what’s hot amazon not the biggest threat to high street retailers retails data challenge high street stores embrace digital to entice customers £m competition seeks tech to rejuvenate high street the pros and cons of putting wifi into high street stores us fashion retailer tilly’s aligns it with marketing it needs to improve network infrastructure for future of retail retailers need to adopt ‘fail fast’ attitude to technology uk retailers must invest more in digital technologies and rudoe believes it the creations like this which makes sainsbury’s a great brand to work for he says when you think of the dinner party conversation there are a lot of places you can develop code or mine data “but actually doing it in the context of something – everybody buys and eats food – that’s a really motivating thing” “and to be blunt – everyone’s heard of sainsbury’s” he adds the nectar opportunity and the supermarket is certainly no stranger to data mining – it launched xxxxxx as founding partner in … “data is hugely embedded in the way we go about doing our business” explains rudoe who says sainsbury’s buying and customer teams use the data mined from nectar and internal sources to inform a large number of decisions “we really do understand who is shopping in each store and each region” he says “we do a huge amount of mining to understand which kinds of customers are buying which kinds of products as well as our product development decisions all the way to the obvious things around marketing and rewards” as well as the nectar coalition it uses oracle and teradata platforms in its estate “and i’m not the monopoly of analytics – it’s use all across the business hence why the data is quite pervasive” boardlevel encouragement it also helps to have a technologysavvy ceo backing the team mike coupe who took up the role in july  used to be an it director rudoe says his physicist education and the fact he was responsible for launching asda’s online shopping proposition makes him very engaged with sainsbury’s technology function “he’s been really pushing for paperless ways of working in the office and he’s the chair of the digital steering group” says rudoe and in a challenging time for supermarkets sainsbury’s digital roadmap is encouraging rudoe says the company uses an evolutionary strategy “we’re a good business operating in a difficult market would be one way of putting it and the digital and technology department continues to play a role in that” “when you think of sainsbury’s you immediately think of shops and that’s fundamentally what our business is built around” he says “but increasingly great products and services – that means a very broad technology landscape” cw features enjoy the benefits of cw membership learn more and join ehandbook big data poses weighty challenges for data integration best practices ehandbook eu data protection essential

sainsbury’s – jon rudoe bringing people into digital by emma herrod march     am share linkedin twitter facebook google email jon rudoe digital  technology director sainsbury’s spoke to emma herrod about transformation digital and technology and why it is now about people over the next few months sainsbury’s plans to launch its online clothing offering uk wide install wifi in its supermarkets continue the test and rollout of a mobile app which will take store customers from compiling a shopping list to paying for their shopping on their mobile phone and expanding its digital team – which works across the business – from  to  this is all part of sainsbury’s evolving strategy to enable its customers to shop whenever and wherever they want clothing the retailer has been engaging online with customers of its tu clothing range since launching a standalone regional pilot site in august  operating in the midlands only the pilot has been “very successful” says jon rudoe digital  technology director sainsbury’s irdx rsbr he adds that the company is building on sales of its men’s women’s and children’s clothing ranges in store which have made it the seventh biggest clothing line in the uk by volume and eleventh by value more than  million customers buy the range and in the  financial year it generated annual sales of approximately £m “it’s been growing at more than double the rate of grocery retailing” adds rudoe “clothing is a different mission online than in store” he says consequently the company has been moving customers on from regarding clothing as a complementary purchase while they are doing their grocery shop in store to seeing it as a dedicated clothing purchase online the standalone clothing site is being rolled out store by store across the country during the first half of  this is so each one is ready to accept click and collect orders as the site goes live in their area customers can also choose to have their order delivered to their home all orders are fulfilled from sainsbury’s central clothing depot in bedford which also handles replenishment for the  stores stocking the clothing range mobile scan  go following a more iterative process with rollout later this year is the mobile shopping app this takes store customers all the way from compiling their shopping list through to paying and checking out instore another version simply gave customers a running total of what they were putting into their basket or trolley in the supermarket explains rudoe while mobile scan  go tested since  took customers from scanning items as they shopped through to paying at a dedicated area instore this has been trialled at supermarkets in tadley in hampshire london colney superstore in hertfordshire and leicester north the latest version of the mobile shopping app is being tested by staff at a store in south london and rudoe says that with the app changing almost weekly rollout will be happening throughout  “when it’s ready we’ll start to do it” he says the app enables customers to build a virtual basket of their favourite products from anywhere before they shop it then helps them to navigate around the store and find the items they want faster allowing them to scan items at the shelf and then pay via their mobile without going to a physical till “ of sainsbury’s customers shop instore and over  of them write a shopping list before visiting so scan  go is digitising a real customer need” says rudoe developing the app has been challenging the digital team has had to make sure that it’s ready for colleagues and customers and that the technology and processes are robust since the items that customers are looking for have to be in the correct location instore as indicated by the map on the app the checkout and payments method also has to be secure and sainsbury’s has already announced that it will work with mobile payments facilitator zapp rudoe says the company will “probably build that into our shopping app” as well it is also about to launch another version of its ondemand film television and music entertainment site on the unified platform the grocery site continues to evolve with small changes since the company’s migration to ibm websphere the delivery pass and green delivery times which show online customers when a van will be in their area are two recent innovations culture  capability combining digital with technology in one role rather than having a ‘traditional’ it director is how sainsbury’s is keeping everything it does with it customercentric in the same way that systems have evolved from simple product to warehouse to store to customer so digital now pervades every part of the business enabling customers to buy what they want via whichever channels they prefer explains rudoe product is moving around the business from warehouse to store or direct to customers product information is needed by many different parts of the business from the web and mobile sites to the product size information being used for delivery “complexity has grown out of all proportions” says rudoe if you go back  –  years technology was present but not in the hands of customers systems were large and supply chain and it were outsourced to accenture “unless systems broke the ceo didn’t want to talk to you” the company has been thinking very hard about architecture and services and how it reuses components and platforms and makes data available across the business in  it purchased a teradata data warehouse appliance to accommodate its rapidly expanding requirements  it is now about reusability and scalability of architecture and not silos explains rudoe it comes back to iterative processes if you want rapid releases you can’t go back and test and change lots of core systems they have to be able to evolve along with the businesses “that gives us an interesting set of puzzles” he says digital has moved from selfservice checkouts instore to a device that staff or the customer carries with them so sainsbury’s drive is to be customercentric in the technology that’s used as well as the developments “it’s a multiyear journey” says rudoe so the company is working on the most important things first that differentiate it hence the mobile scan  go app “the big thing for us is development iteration” explains rudoe the company has to think carefully about what it’s developing what drives competitive advantage and how it can be built inhouse rather than using an offtheshelf product – although “the backend is plug in” he says “we want to be able to experiment to change” adds rudoe which is why the company is now doing development inhouse and expanding its digital team through a new digital lab space at its offices in holborn london he’s keen to point out that the digital lab has not been created for people to experiment and play with technology although there will be an element of that the focus of the team’s development effort will be on things which will differentiate the retailer and make a difference to its customers – such as the mobile app which is digitising a customer problem “that’s a key point” he says since the digital lab – which he is “recruiting heavily” for at the moment – will be run around modern iterative approaches to development sainsbury’s purchase of the entertainment business was the beginning of its shift towards inhouse development as it provided a seed capability for innovation the digital lab comprises a team of around  with plans to recruit a further  customer at the heart uptime is no longer the key measure for digital says rudoe as the drivers have changed to how something works whether customers can use it their experience and whether it is cost effective and scalable as an omnichannel business there are products that each customer buys regularly and there are multiple ways that they can buy them from the company sainsbury’s aim is to show customers what they have bought when they need to buy more and for them to buy those items in any channel past purchases instore are already shown online seeing customers in another touchpoint shows more about them so there’s also a big crm issue he explains “we know our customers better than anyone else” rudoe says twelve million of its customers have a nectar card and the company processes  million transactions per week with customers increasingly purchasing little and often from convenience stores over £bn is spent online through the grocery business – a figure which the new ecommerce platform has the capacity to double “so not only do we know them personally – through store staff having conversations with them – but we also know them through the data of the longstanding nectar loyalty scheme” he explains “we have a longterm agreement with nectar to do more” there is also a sainsbury’swide project not only to improve the single view of the customer across the business but also to join up each customer’s identifications with the different parts of the brand as it isn’t just a grocery and clothing business rudoe’s remit encompasses the digital component of the products the company sells such as the ebooks films videos and music sold by the entertainment business as well as banking and general merchandise sainsbury’s wants to be there for its customers wherever and whenever they want to shop be that at a physical store or increasingly “where they are” using a device such as a mobile rudoe explains “we’re being there on devices as that’s where customers are” sainsbury’s is also ‘being where’ its customers are away from its stores too as shown by the expansion of click  collect to london underground stations of course technology is not just for customers and customerfacing operations a key part of the business is getting the right technology into the hands of colleagues such as store managers for example information which in the past would have been printed out on paper can now be delivered digitally technology change is affecting staff in other ways too those working in customerfacing roles are used to being asked by customers where something is instore but now they could be asked about how the mobile app works or how to access the store wifi so part of the transformation at sainsbury’s is about getting staff more comfortable with technology and “used to kit” colleagues can talk digitally to each other via microsoft’s yammer enterprise socialnetworking platform they have also been partnered with a digital mentor as part of a twoway system these digital mentors additionally act as a focus group for the business the retailer is operating in difficult times with the industry going through a “once in a generation change” it is evolving its strategy to address the continuing shifts in shopping patterns something which ceo mike coupe believes will lead to a greater emphasis on product quality and ease of shopping and an increase in multichannel shopping “the key word for our strategy is evolving” says rudoe explaining that most of what the company is doing is a continuation of what it has done in the past – with a change of emphasis the digital experience is at the heart of what his team does and it is “getting going on technology inside the organisation and with customers” with a new grocery platform clothing soon to go live and internal data projects to link up customers across the brand running alongside looking at ways to differentiate through mobile the plans for digital in  are already looking busy – fortunately the digital team is also about to get much bigger additional information strategy box in november  sainsbury’s set out how it plans to evolve to win in a ”once in a generation” time of change for the industry customers it said are turning online and to convenience stores and away from outoftown stores as they shop more often and supermarkets must adapt it concluded from a sixmonth review of the business that supermarket sales will continue to fall in coming years it said it would prioritise investment in online and multichannel as well as convenience stores that investment includes opening its first dark store in  at bromleybybow as well as focusing expansion plans on convenience stores which will make up more than half of its new openings in the years to come mentioned in this piece… sainsbury’s irdx rsbr

 and  set up a small dairy shop in a rented property on drury lane in the centre of london no one could have predicted it would become one of britain’s most loved storesbut this young couple were mary ann staples daughter of a dairy shop owner and john james sainsbury son of a craftsman and they understood what their customers wanted from their first days of tradinglondon remained then as it is now the commercial heart of the country but the conditions for trading were a world away from those today there was no refrigeration so fresh food would quickly rot and there was no guarantee of quality overcrowding coupled with a lack of hygiene meant that people would get sick from food more regularly than todaythe sainsbury family set out to change this they sold fresh milk from cows living in the countryside while some of their competitors watered down milk taken from cows that lived in the polluted confines of the city“mrs sainsbury made the shop famous for the quality of its butter she was always up very early in the morning and took great pride in the cleanliness of the shop”sarah pullen one of the first sainsbury’s colleaguesmary ann would scrub the store to ensure it was as hygienic as possible one of the couple’s ﬁrst colleagues sarah pullen said “mrs sainsbury was always up very early in the morning and took great pride in the cleanliness of the shop”the couple would store food in the cool depths of their basement to give it a longer shelf life john james wanted to ensure the freshness of products and brought in an innovative move of insisting that the butter from his dutch suppliers was stamped with the date it was made his idea was so good that the dutch government later made compulsory and from their first days of trading mary ann and john james set out to make sure that their food was affordablethey sainsbury family quickly gained the loyalty of their customers and their reputation for quality at low prices quickly spread they built on their initial success opening stores in kentish town islington and croydon sainsbury’s started expanding their range of products selling sausages and ham in  the shop started offering own brand goods including bacon which was smoked in allcroft road in north west londonit was around this time that sainsbury’s adopted its first slogan quality perfect prices lower” this attitude has remained our core value and is reflected in slogans throughout the years from “good food costs less at sainsbury’s” to “live well for less” quality perfect price lower sainsbury’s jon rudoe now appointed to handle digital
