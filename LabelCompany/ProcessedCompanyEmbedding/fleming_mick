samuel jay harkins jay to its board of directors martin kunkel and eastside cofounder lenny gotter have retired from the boardmr kunkel will continue to serve as the companys chief marketing officer and mr gotter will serve in a consultative role following these changes the eastside board is now comprised of six directors of which four are independent as defined by nasdaq and the us securities and exchange commission sec ruleswe welcome the addition of these four outstanding new board members said eastside president and ceo steven earles collectively these new directors contribute valuable experience knowledge and expertise in business development and the capital markets as well as with the spirits industry which we believe will support our efforts to grow eastside into a significant national supplier of craft spiritseastsides chairman of the board grover wickersham said i would like to first thank steven earles for his leadership in strengthening the eastside board which prepares the company for growth both as a business and as a public company this shows great vision on his part i would also like to acknowledge the contribution of lenny gotter cofounder of eastside who is leaving the board but will remain as a consultantin our view mr wickersham continued having the majority of our board be independent directors especially directors who in this case are mostly also shareholders themselves is a best practice from a corporate governance perspective adding this strong group of directors and establishing a majority of independent directors satisfies nasdaqs corporate governance requirements this is an important first step towards achieving our goal to uplist our common stock to a national securities market such as nasdaq in the future eastside is already
