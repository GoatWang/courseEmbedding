exist in the onshore oil drilling industry while working on oil well stimulation site in alberta canada davidson heard from a friend in the industry that there was a need for fast effective and inexpensive stimulation treatment for oil wells after using the most sophisticated oil recovery techniques oil companies only retrieve a fraction of the crude oil at their sites the oil well will become too uneconomical to continue pumping because most of the remaining oil is stuck in the nooks and crannies between the rock and sand even after all work is done around 0 of oil is left in the ground with more than  fields in north america alone extracting even as little as 0 more oil would translate to billions of more barrels of oil recovered primary oil recovery stageedit during primary recovery the natural pressure of the reservoir or gravity drive oil into the wellbore combined with artificial lift techniques such as pumps which bring the oil to the surface but only about 0 percent of a reservoirs original oil in place is typically produced during primary recovery but petroleum isn’t the only thing trapped in the earth water hides there too sooner or later the reservoir begins producing water along with oil and it becomes uneconomical to continue the oil companies will then reinject the water back into the reservoir this stage of production is called secondary recovery secondary oil recovery stageedit water injection helps maintain downhole pressure so that oil can continue to flow water from the injection well is also used to sweep or push the oil towards the producing wells but rock in the reservoir has varying permeabilities the more permeable the rock is the more easily the fluid can flow through water takes the path of least resistance when pumped into the ground unfortunately water flows more readily than oil and it always takes the path of least resistance once water creates a channel through the permeable rock to the producing wellbore there is little benefit in injecting additional water it only bypasses the oil instead of sweeping it ahead the result is poor recovery from the reservoir products and technologiesedit wavefront technology solutionss patented technology was created to combat the “path of least resistance” in this way the powerwave and the primawave share the same scientific principles this technology originally penned as power pulse technology uses pulses to improve the liquid flow in the ground for improved oil recovery ior in the energy sector and groundwater remediation in the environmental sector these identical processes generate a fluid pulse that momentarily expands the pore structure of rock and soil liquid is then able to flow freely and more uniformly early iterations of wavefront technology solutionss power pulse technology were penned the “premier pulse tool” the premier pulse tool or ppt for short was a twometer long steel mandrel with a valve system on top and inverted swab cups on the bottom diagram of how powerwave and primawave’s fluid pulses generate a more uniform flow of liquid using a standard well servicing rig the ppt would be lowered to a location above the well perforations the tool would then be raised up eight meters and dropped this was done between 0 times over eight to  hours this workover and field stimulation technique used steady nonseismic pulse vibrations to knock out perforation blockage and create a tsunamilike wave effect that encouraged flow in the reservoir this technology utilized in both the powerwave and primawave generates a fluid pressure pulse that causes a momentary elastic flexure of the pore structure this pressure pulse moves fluid in and out of a larger number of pore networks obtaining a more uniform injection front powerwaveedit in the energy sector wavefront technology solutions inc has patented the power pulse technology as “powerwave” this process has been fieldtested and proven to increase the amount of oil recovered from on shore oil wells including lowproducing or even abandoned fields powerwave utilizes this technology to improve the flow of water through geological materials including sedimentary soils and fractured rock these materials are composed of a solid matrix and pore structure which contain fluids such as gas and oil the powerwave tool generates a fluid displacement wave in the porous media akin to ripples from a stone thrown in a pond these ripples generate high liquid accelerations in the pores facing liquids out or treatment fluids in0 in the ten plus years that the technology behind powerwave has been developed by wavefront technologies and environmental services it has evolved from a product that cost nearly  to make and had to be transported using two tractor trailers to one that can be shipped via courier the powerwave tool now is only one meter high and eight centimeters in diameter wavefront technology solutions inc leases the product to oil companies and charges around  a month for a minimum month period powerwave’s ability to improve uniformity in oil wells has translated to higher production rates extending the life of a field and enhancing its value in

environmental technologies the company was founded in  as petech by ceo brett davidson and university of alberta professor tim spanos the company was later changed to wavefront technologies and environmental services and then wavefront technology solutions inc and is known for its patented technology that sends pulses through the ground to simulate the effects of the aftershock of an earthquake to aid in the recovery of stranded oil these technologies simulate the beating of a heart  when a heart pumps it sends pulses through the bodies blood vessels causing the network of capillaries to expand and contract when a pulse is applied to the ground it expands and contracts the porous rock essentially freeing the trapped oil this technology is used for fluid flow optimization having applications in both the environmental and energy sectors in the environmental sector the process is marketed as primawave while in the energy sector it is marketed as powerwave powerwave technology has been put to use in more than  well applications throughout north america including applications in california oklahoma and alberta powerwave has already been used in the field

and e solutions inc was renamed wavefront energy and environmental services usa inc effective march   the company’s name was changed to “wavefront technology solutions inc” rationaleedit diagram of trapped oil in soil and rock brett davidson and university of alberta professor tim spanos teamed up in  to fulfill a need that they believed to exist in the onshore oil drilling industry while working on oil well stimulation site in alberta canada davidson heard from a friend in the industry that there was a need for fast effective and inexpensive stimulation treatment for oil wells after using the most sophisticated oil recovery techniques oil companies only retrieve a fraction of the crude oil at their sites the oil well will become too uneconomical to continue pumping because most of the remaining oil is stuck in the nooks and crannies between the rock and sand even after all work is done around 0 of oil is left in the ground with more than  fields in north america alone extracting even as little as 0 more oil would translate to billions of more barrels of oil recovered primary oil recovery stageedit during primary recovery the natural pressure of the reservoir or gravity drive oil into the wellbore combined with artificial lift techniques such as pumps which bring the oil to the surface but only about 0 percent of a reservoirs original oil in place is typically produced during primary recovery but petroleum isn’t the only thing trapped in the earth water hides there too sooner or later the reservoir begins producing water along with oil and it becomes uneconomical to continue the oil companies will then reinject the water back into the reservoir this stage of production is called secondary recovery secondary oil recovery stageedit water injection helps maintain downhole pressure so that oil can continue to flow water from the injection well is also used to sweep or push the oil towards the producing wells but rock in the reservoir has varying permeabilities the more permeable the rock is the more easily the fluid can flow through water takes the path of least resistance when pumped into the ground unfortunately water flows more readily than oil and it always takes the path of least resistance once water creates a channel through the permeable rock to the producing wellbore there is little benefit in injecting additional water it only bypasses the oil instead of sweeping it ahead the result is poor recovery from the reservoir products and technologiesedit wavefront technology solutionss patented technology was created

comprehensive api massively integrated pricing product demo videos customers about resources events contact us blog get started clover the iot vendor needed wavefront to monitor thousands of devices in the field  case study clover clover builds integrated pointofsale devices for merchants from customized hardware to cloudbased software it has deployed more than  smart payment terminals primarily serving small and mediumsized businesses and is growing quickly since 0 the firm has been a subsidiary of first data the world’s largest credit card processor the challenge with customers literally depending on clover’s terminals to do business reliability is key three years after launching the startup found it increasingly difficult to track the health of its growing fleet of devices it was relying primarily on customer service reports and analysis of field returns to identify problems this reactive approach was expensive slow and imprecise most importantly it diminished merchant satisfaction our solution clover cofounder and president of engineering john beatty oversaw a rollout of the wavefront data analytics platform previously data from sensors on the company’s devices wasn’t being captured let alone analyzed now with more  devices in the field collecting data from the os application and hardware engineers had unprecedented visibility by enabling metrics they cared about they could easily track everything from temperature fluctuations to software failures identifying and fixing issues before customers noticed for example engineers quickly noticed that four percent of devices were sluggish for four hours a day using the platform they isolated a faulty software component that was causing light sensors to go haywire in certain lighting conditions “before wavefront we would’ve had no clue what was going on” beatty says “we were able to fix the software bug and validate that it had exactly the effect we intended” once clover had insights into performance it began using wavefront to inform project management decisions for instance the team tracked how often merchants were charging clover’s mobile devices to help understand optimal battery size ensuring new devices were as compact and inexpensive as possible the data has fed into requirements for a product currently in development clover has also used wavefront to speed up and improve the quality of software releases employing phased rollouts clover has used metrics to quickly validate whether new releases cause any problems in updated devices “it’s an absolutely critical tool for us to release software confidently if we didn’t have it we’d be slower and more conservative and make more mistakes in production” beatty says wavefront is optimal for internet of things companies such as clover because “historically devices aren’t terribly wellinstrumented and there’s a lot of guessing” beatty says devices in the field often operate on lowbandwidth connections so they don’t pump out massive amounts of logs in addition many of the data points companies like his care about — from system load to cpu utilization — are classic metrics for clover’s part “we continue to add metrics anywhere and everywhere” beatty says the results adopting wavefront has reduced clover’s support calls meaning both happier customers and higher profit margins it has also curtailed outages and prevented revenue loss according to beatty improved performance correlates directly with how many of clover’s devices are sold in first data’s distribution network which also markets earliergeneration competitors the visibility wavefront offers is a critical foundation for the company’s plans to scale up including future international expansion and it has allowed clover to move faster with better products and speedier software releases “it’s critical for the pace of innovation” beatty says “ before wavefront we would have no clue about what was going on now we can fix

with maximizing integration options in mind all actions that take place in the user interface can also be performed by api calls integrating wavefront with your environment is easy thanks to our flexible api whether you have custom visualizations external applicationsalerting systems or are looking for ways to programmatically create charts and dashboards wavefront has it covered” clement pang founder  engineer events using wavefront users can easily overlay system events onto charts for example a code deployment event can be overlaid and used to see how the deployment correlates with your underlying system and application users can also generate external events alongside various actions with the flexible api including operational orchestration with tools such as puppet and chef additionally we can create events for each change deployment or release the events api allows you to easily configure any platform to send events directly to wavefront tagging when bringing up or taking down hosts in the cloud ops scripts can call wavefront’s flexible api to automatically tag hosts or sources in wavefront therefore this makes it easy to group hosts in wavefront in order to set alerts on them or query for them later notifications  alerts most of our customers take the alerts generated from wavefront and forward them to emails and pagerduty this is a standard feature in wavefront along with this we also support webhooks which can make your alerting options even more powerful webhooks in wavefront allow users to integrate actions with alerts with webhooks wavefront’s flexible api can invoke arbitrary actions when alerts fire enabling you to execute autoremediation scripts or configure arbitrary actions beyond the outofthebox email and pagerduty integrations additionally apart from the standard notifications in wavefront you can configure webhooks to notify your other systems and pass useful information around an alerting event we have customers who have integrated alerts with enterprise messaging systems like slack and hipchat visualizations wavefront’s flexible api supports various charts types such as line chart point plot and stacked area charts further these chart types are widely used in most telemetry monitoring use cases we also continue to add more chart types and customers can extend their capabilities themselves by extracting wavefront’s query results and importing them into many other visualization platforms and uis using the query api our customers can use wavefront as the telemetry platform and query engine and interface it with their existing ui or any other ui of their choosing there are stunning examples where customers have integrated wavefront with d charts and created calendar heat maps or bar charts d and more one of our customers created a dashboard that captured business metrics which represented features and their respective availabilities they sourced data originating from various regions eg iowavirginia the information was displayed in monthweekday views therefore they were able to create their own calendar based heatmap visualization by using the wavefront api they created their own custom visualization and used it in addition to wavefront’s own charts the wavefront api makes it easy to get data out so customers can visualize their data in any way they wish statistical computations wavefront can deliver realtime highfrequency data fast ingestion realtime querying speedofthought analytics clear visualizations and effective alerting additionally the wavefront query language is capable of performing most of the transformations you’ll need for daily monitoring however there are cases when you may want to perform very complex computations that the query language doesn’t currently offer or leverage a set of libraries you’ve already written in r to do analytics in these cases you may want to run r as a separate analytics layer on top of your wavefront account with wavefront r library you should be able to do just about any type of analysis or visualization you can imagine want to see a histogram of your metric at an arbitrary binwidth or a heat map of the correlations between your metrics or model your metrics for trends seasonality noise and make a forecast about future behavior all this can be easily done using the wavefront r library productrealtime

lumetrics inc announced today that it is acquiring key assets of the former wavefront sciences company from abbott  this business transaction will allow lumetrics to expand its repertoire of services and grow its business substantially  lumetrics begun in rochester in  is known for its optigauge system which is designed to reduce production time and enhance quality for the manufacturers of medical devices optics and industrial materials  two of the three new assets will help lumetrics in one of its main areas of business – that of assisting lensmakers with quality control  the new assets include the clearwave and crystalwave products critical in the ophthalmics industry for the production of contact lenses and intraocular lenses  with these acquisitions lumetrics will now be able to help contact lens makers and lensimplant makers reach unprecedented levels of precision  the ultimate goal is to help manufacturers produce consistently clear comfortable and reliable contact and iol lenses  with a third product the clasd sensor lumetrics will have the ability to monitor quality in several new arenas most notably that of laser light  the sensor can measure align and direct laser light allowing lumetrics to work with everything from microscopic optics to satellite communications lumetrics which started at high tech rochester’s htr lennox tech enterprise center is expected to grow by 0 percent with the new acquisitions  “the wavefront sciences products are a perfect fit to our business” said john hart ceo lumetrics  “we share the same ophthalmic customer base and this acquisition allows us to merge our technologies to provide a more featurerich offering to solve customer problems that neither company could do on its own”  the new clasd offering allows lumetrics to enter a whole new market with existing and new products   “we are excited about obtaining such an important diagnostic tool” hart said   “this allows us to better serve our customers and we look forward to the significant growth opportunities these products will bring” lumetrics closed on the acquisition in july and is in the process of the knowledge transfer to its rochester new york headquarters  lumetrics will continue to work with key individuals from wavefront sciences including hardware and software engineers and sales  marketing individuals  terms of the acquisition will remain confidential “we have finalized orders for new systems as well as maintenance and service contracts for existing systems” said steve heveronsmith vice president of business development  “our

pricing difference easy and powerful query language for ultimate flexibility   contact us for more pricing info q how does the wavefront pricing model work a we have a simple and flexible payasyougo model our usagebased price is based on the rate at which you send metric data to wavefront during the course of each month this gives you the flexibility to start with any size application you want and scale updown as needed q do you charge more for customer support a no unlike some other monitoring products enterpriseclass support is included in the price we pride ourselves on making every customer successful whatever it takes q do you charge for storing metrics data a no you do not pay any storage costs for your data q what if i have an unexpected peak or burst of data in a month a we understand that you may occasionally have peaks and bursts of data that are not typical –and we do not want to unfairly charge you for those we measure the rate that is used for pricing as the th percentile of the  hour averages of data rates for the month this provides you with a nocost buffer for occasional peaks and bursts q how do i budget for how much wavefront will cost a talk to us we have a lot of experience with different customers and applications and can help you estimate your costs to give you an idea a typical host configuration that is sending  metrics every 0 seconds would cost  per host per month q does the price vary for different types of metric data a no our pricing model is very simple and we do not differentiate on the types of metrics data you send us standard metrics and custom metrics are the same price we have many customers who send us a combination of typical system metrics application metrics standard and custom and even custom business metrics q can i manage how many metrics are sent from the agent on a host to wavefront a yes you have complete control over how much data is sent to wavefront and what that data is q do you charge for data collection agents a no our pricing model is only based on the metrics data –we don’t care where that data comes from you can have as many or as few data collection agents as you like productrealtime

to control light from simply bending light in one direction to diffuse light in a controlled manner or to create a complicated dimensional image we can replicate features as small as a few nanometers to over 0 microns in height we emboss rolls of film product from  to  wide with thickness of  microns to  microns wfts proprietary tooling technology allows us to obtain shorter job turnaround with a degree of complexity possessed by few other producers in the world we are capable of producing replicated structures with nearly vertical walls for application not typically serviced by a roll to roll production process which can deliver large volumes of product at economical prices once a structure has been replicated wft has the capability to finish the product inhouse wft is a onestop producer for all your microstructure replication needs wft has the capability of originating many forms of microstructures we have inhouse diamond turning holographic and some lithographic origination capabilities and can obtain other origination tooling such as laser oblation computer generated holograms and dot matrix holograms wft has become a fully integrated facility with the ability to originate your diamond turned machined dtm structure produce product of the structure in a rr process metallize it if necessary and finish it completely inhouse wfts new diamond turning facility is an ultra precision diamond machining lab the materials that are currently machined are acrylic brass copper and nickel many types of molds can be produced in this lab these molds are then turned into embossing tools used on a uv casting machine to replicate the structure onto a film substrate the types of cuts that can be made for toolmold fabrication include cylindrical drum tools flat faced mold tools and flycut tools for exotic and deep aspect ratio films the types of patterns that can be cut include grooves prism and truncated prism structures grooves that have a new angle on each cut and also valleys with rounded tip radii up to virtual dead sharp notches at wft molds can be manipulated after cutting the shape can be changed or textured in a way that diamond turning alone can not achieve wavefronts holographic capabilities are a result of years working on industrial applications employing holographic optical elements hoes these were used for applications like linear and rotary encoders backplane reflectors for lighting application telecom elements etc our recording facility has produced the largest diffraction gratings in the world to meet the highest demands of the package industry this lab is capable of originating hoes diffraction gratings and holographic diffusers tmd® lithographic images can be originated using high quality mask to generate a  dimensional patterns with depths up to several microns our proprietary tooling has been developed over the last  years wft provides tooling to the holographic embossing industry and is known for rapid turnaround and high quality this tooling technology allows wft to combine microstructures step and repeat starting from as small as ¼ to as large as  x  with this technology wft was able to decrease the turnaround time in the holographic embossing industry from what use to take  weeks to as little as  day wft employs the same technology with dtm structures such as prisms unlike other manufacturers of prismatic films who run directly off of a dtm cylinder wft makes master tooling from the dtm cylinder we then combine the prism structure into panels which size is dependent on the final product this allows us to build a tooling tree that we rely on to continue a product line for many years instead of having to recut a cylinder when an image wears out or gets damaged we only go back  generation and make a new copy which is used to make the product this is a cost effective method which allows for a consistent product with a long life production equipment is custom built inhouse and some operated in class 0 cleanrooms since the equipment used to make our products is specialized we had to design it ourselves wft has a full machine shop which builds and maintains our equipment because it is built here we have the intimate knowledge that allows us to maintain repair and improve the equipment this equipment is proprietary and very specialized and would be difficult for a competitor to duplicate with out the years of experience we already have uv formulations used to make our products are mixed inhouse wft has a uv polymer lab used for rd and a production mixing facility wft has many standard formulations produced in house by mixing various raw materials together these formulations are used to produce product on our production equipment we currently produce many different custom formulations depending on the required microstructured product different structures require different raw materials depending on the specifications of the final product this inhouse ability allows us full control to adjust a formulation during rd to work for a specific structure to achieve the desired result wft is a leader in the nanostructure and microstructure industry due to our vast experience with so many different structures we have over 0 year experience working with microstructures as well as over  years producing rolls of product there are few companies with the experience and ability to originate tool up and produce the custom products that wft is capable of producing wft technology inc wft produces a number of custom microreplicated optical films microstructure
