the pimco multiasset volatility fund treats volatility as an asset class and targets net annualised returns of  to  per cent with equivalent volatility independent of broad measures of market return positions span interest rates equities commodities and currencies and reflect structural opportunistic and tailrisk hedging dimensions josh thimons josh davis and matt dorsten the fund’s portfolio management team are supported by pimco’s extensive firmwide resources across trade operations portfolio managementanalytics and product management pimco combines its deep understanding of volatility markets with a robust macroeconomic investment process the portfolio is designed so that no single theme dominates within structural strategies each asset class has a  to  per cent expected source of added value and risk contribution while for alpha strategies it is  to  per cent   product manager min xiao pictured says “structural positions exploit the tendency for levels of price volatility implied by options markets to exceed the values that are actually realised structural anomalies persist because endusers of the options markets are like insurance buyers who willingly pay a volatility premium each structural sleeve may have its own hedging requirements and together the structural strategies are sized with particular risk targets and diversification effects in mind   “discretionary positions express relative value views both within and across the asset classes in conditional form often influenced by macro considerations these conditional positions are designed to produce asymmetric payoffs with limited downside risk these positions two or three per asset class on average add an element of risk diversification and are rigorously governed with stoploss and targeted gain limits”   min also stresses the importance of tailrisk hedging in overall portfolio construction “the tailrisk strategy primarily consists of long volatility positions across multiple markets to hedge against extreme market crises” she says “returns in the active tail risk strategy are generally expected to be negative in benign markets but may produce strong positive returns when the volatility of certain asset classes spikes furthermore the fund is committed to spending at least  basis points per year on tailrisk hedging”   since the fund’s launch in july  equity and bond markets have risen and fallen producing periods of high and low volatility but the mav fund has generated positive returns every month albeit over a short time period says min “up to the end of december the fund returned  per cent net of fees with annualised volatility of  per cent structural positions contributed  per cent of the returns discretionary positions  per cent and tailrisk hedging strategies  per cent”   min believes the fund’s low correlation with traditional asset classes makes it a good diversifier for investor portfolios certainly its marketneutral structure and active tailrisk overlay equip it to add value across asset classes in a variety of market environments   “the competitive landscape is limited for relative value volatility strategies” says min “proprietary trading desks are closing and the hedge fund community too has a much smaller asset base than precrisis while dislocations in the markets have become more frequent and extreme the competition in chasing those dislocations has diminished materially”   she adds “we are delighted by the hedgeweek award and committed to focusing on volatility as an asset class – delivering high absolute returns with limited volatility from pimco’s best ideas across global asset classes”  please click here to download a copy of the hedgeweek special report hedgeweek awards    next in this report saemor capital best market
