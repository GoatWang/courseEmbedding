some dreams require extra effort posts posted on june  july  the countcast app       i can never find a mechanical hand tally counter when i need one you know one of those clicking thingy’s that you hold in your hand and press with your thumb every time you need to increment the count of something well the truth is just like everyone else i’m pretty cheap and am not likely to spend  to  on a hand tally counter even if they are shiny and pretty cool and unless you’re a bouncer at a club who is concerned with the fire code you’re also not likely to be carrying one around in your pocket but you know what you might have in your pocket pause for the inappropriate jokesresponses to that rhetorical question and… that’s right a mobile phone so here at nd shift we decided to build out an app that lets you increment and decrement a running count that can be broadcasted to anyone who wants to know and can send notifications if the count has hit a limit that you can set pretty cool right not only that but the counter can be set to count lots groups lanes rooms and all manners of groupings in addition multiple people can be added to help keep the count and they can text one another within the app via the same broadcast feature eliminating the need for walkietalkies we call it simply “countcast” and you can use it to keep count of anything and to collaborate we started out trying to solve a simple parking problem at our church the church had  volunteers coordinating the flow of traffic and managing the lot capacity where cars are constantly coming in and out through the church entrance during the  worship services offered on sunday the need was to provide a way to keep a manual count of the number of cars that were coming inout of the parking lot and which parking lanes had open parking spots so the volunteers could direct drivers to the appropriate lanes where spots were available in addition when the parking lot got full send an automated notice to church goers arriving late you know who you are to use the overflow lot so here at nd shift we decided to build out an app that let the volunteer’s increment and decrement a running count of the overall lot and each parking lane the count could be shared and maintained by a team we also added the messaging part because the volunteers were using walkietalkies to communicate the count or issues to one another we also added the ability to subscribe to the count so you will know when the lot is full and since we built the app and wanted other people to use it we opened it for free public use it is easy to set up and you can get started quickly just follow these simple steps open a web browser on your mobile phone or tablet go to the following url  httpthecounterherokuappcom next come up with a nickname for your user account and click the submit button if this is your first time using the app you will also need to come up with a name for the counter next determine if you want to maintain a single master count or if you want different count groups for instance counting by floor or room that’s it commence counting other things to keep in mind you can define the starting point of the count the default is zero but you can set it to any number decide if you are incrementing or decrementing the count this helps so you can set the max limit so you have a threshold that can send an automated broadcast to anyone who has subscribed to be notified that the limit has been reached decide if you want to solo count or count in a group we’ll send you a link to share with your friendspartners working with you once you’re done you will also get a link for users to subscribe to the count in case they want to know if the club is full or there is no parking spots left here are some other suggestions for how you can use this app work at the local barnightclub where you have to manage capacity use this app to count the number of patrons entering and leaving your establishment working parking duty for your local organization or for a game where you are opening up your lot use this app to count the number of cars coming in and out have a small business where you need to do physical inventory counts and need a handy app here you go how are we making it more fun… we are now working on an automated parking counter in adruino this will allow you to update the app with a simple physical device that you tape to the pavement and will count the cars coming in and out this way you don’t have to maintain the count manually it will happen as cars enter and exit the lot amazon alexa companion skill lets you ask alexa if the lot is full or it can return the number of available slots this is useful if you’re about to leave the house and want to check the parking lot condition for the techies out there we will also be publishing a web services api in the future so you can build anything cool on top of our code base want to collaborate if you want to team with us to make this app more meaningful let’s hear your idea contact us at adminndshiftllccom posted on june  june  thinking about mission statement lately we’ve been working on our mission statement to make sure it is simple concise and achievable after all if it’s too lofty then it really doesn’t drive anything between all the wordsmithing and cliche ideas the mission statement is starting to look a lot like a manifesto this reminded  us of the manifesto holstee produced when they started those are big ideas right maybe the best thing is to do as bre pettis and koi stark suggest in there cult of done manifesto pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing… here is the rest of there manifesto which they put together in under  minutes there are three states of being not knowing action and completion accept that everything is a draft it helps to get it done there is no editing stage pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it banish procrastination if you wait more than a week to get an idea done abandon it the point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done once you’re done you can throw it away laugh at perfection it’s boring and keeps you from being done people without dirty hands are wrong doing something makes you right failure counts as done so do mistakes destruction is a variant of done if you have an idea and publish it on the internet that counts as a ghost of done done is the engine of more   wow now we’re feeling inspired ok that just what we’ll do just spend  minutes on the mission statement and get it done right after we finish this post… categories  mvps in  months  alexa skill  arduino
