leadershipfeb thleave a comment domenico bertini vp of field operations for american income life imagine you arrive at work one morning to the evidence of a burglary a brand new server printer or fax machine has disappeared you call the building security officer and the police then you launch your own investigation you are determined to find out how this happened and who is responsible you will not rest until the case is solved and you immediately increase security measures—no more property will be lost now think about the last time one of your most talented agents was stolen by the competition or just walked out your door what kind of investigation did you launch what measures were implemented to prevent it from happening again maybe the loss of a  –  asset set off no alarm bells because no one ever really assessed the cost of losing talent while there’s really no silver bullet for keeping everyone we hire there are a few steps you can take to increase your talent retention keep your best people in front of the line you’ll have significant payoff the best american income life agents solve customer problems and capitalize on opportunities to upsell products or services these high performing agents build your service reputation and help you combat negative feedback  losing high performers could cost your agency tens of thousands in immediate growth not to mention the time you’ll have to spend in recruitment training and learning curve costs to replace them yet most agencies don’t differentiate among agents who voluntarily choose to leave and our turnover statistics only summarize the total of terminations in that month quarter or year a much deeper dive is needed start with exit interviews and find out why they are leaving you will learn that most of the time they are not leaving the company but they are leaving a bad manager we need to develop a talent mindset and part of this includes tracking terminations by performance it should be a cardinal sin to lose a top performer a senior manager if not an executive should call top performing agents who voluntarily terminate this will help our managers to focus on retaining the “rock stars” of american income life there’s no magic bullet for keeping your best people talent retention involves doing a number of things well although turnover is most often attributed to income  to  of the reasons people leave are related to supervision they leave their managers so clearly training our managers not only to recruit but also to motivate and inspire talent is a retention factor you cannot overlook a missing link in many agencies especially as they grow larger is the human touch your top talent wants to be treated important in the organization little things make a big difference american income life’s great founder bernard rapoport always made an effort to know and remember the top talents’ names in the company and recognize them when in front of them that little recognition was often more important than a bonus check for many of us  how can you feel anything but disengaged when you feel like a number agencies that find ways to value their talent and focus on retention as well as recruiting will be miles ahead in the upcoming growth journey we have started many years ago related postscharacteristics of the top leaderdon’t show the way – lead the waysomething to think

reduced when people…they are people…feel wanted cared about and a part of things there are some rules but the fitst one is simple and the oldest  do to others what you would have others do to you  compliment nice appearance  know something about everyone  is a relative sickask about them  do they have a question answer it without talking down or reminding them ‘you were taught this’  look at them men are your equals as are women  talk to their eyes if you’re looking somewhere else guys the ladies darn well know it it’s rude  never raise your voice get softer if you’re unhappy they listen harder  replace insulting displays of displeassure with ‘i’m disappointed that this happened”  the ‘employee’ in front of you is a creation of the same god you may have authority but that makes your accountability higher when it comes to how you treat them  treat everyone with respect and love as our wise leader says being personal and caring helps retain the single biggest cost we have is training and recruiting we spend a lot of time replacing folks that we could have kept if we hadn’t been too busy to care bravo sir this article is dead on wes elder nz view february   great article dom – the best in this series of leadership comments it’s such common sense but those who look for it when ‘being managed’ tend to overlook it ‘when managing’ and that’s probably why “b” had this skill – he had no one to manage him jun ma view february   it is very great article the top performance people doesn’t need motivate it is the most important not demotivated them too otherwise  they will disappear later francisco zarathustra view february   wow susan wilson view march   this article is really useful domenico sakerhetsdorrnu view april   my very own english teacher loathe me cause
