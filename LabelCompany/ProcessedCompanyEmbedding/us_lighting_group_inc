group corporation warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of twentyone years from date of purchase if found to be defective as mentioned above it will be replaced or repaired if returned prepaid along with proof of date of purchase this shall constitute the sole remedy of the purchaser and the sole liability of us lighting group corporation to the extent permitted by law the foregoing is exclusive and in lieu of all other warranties or representations whether expressed or implied including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness in no event shall us lighting group corporation be liable for special or consequential damages how is it possible that uslg can offer a  year warranty while everyone else only offers  years our tm testing by ul proved our patent pending bulbs have a  hour rating if you install our bulbs into a facility that leaves the bulbs on  this means the bulbs are on  hours per year maximum and if you divide that into  hours you get  years so how is this  hour rating achieved the answer is simple to start with uslg does not have any transformers or related components in its design look at the photos and you will not see a driver board we have multiple patents pending on this design secondly our competitors use  watt leds and drive them at maximum wattage or even more uslg only uses  watt leds yes this is more expensive to manufacture but when you multiply our  leds x  watt you end up with a bulb that is designed to be a  watt bulb since we “underdrive” the leds at only  watts total they last far longer than any other bulb on the market it makes no sense in replacing a  fluorescent bulb with an expensive led bulb and then have to replace it again in  or  years yes these  watt leds costs more to manufacture the bulb but in the end you need to buy and install only one of ours compared to  of our competitors so which bulb is actually less expensive service in case of malfunction your us lighting group corporation’s product will be repaired free of charges according to the terms of the warranty when returning us lighting group corporation product for
