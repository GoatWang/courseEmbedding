accordance with gaap for the applicable periods the partnership also uses the nongaap financial measures noted above which are reconciled to our gaap based results below these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gaap results ebitda is defined as net income loss before i interest income expense ii income tax expense and iii depreciation and amortization expense adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for the impact of major scheduled turnaround expenses gain or loss on extinguishment of debt loss on disposition of assets expenses associated with the east dubuque merger and business interruption insurance recovery when applicable we present ebitda because we believe it allows users of our financial statements such as investors and analysts to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis we present adjusted ebitda because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes amounts such as major scheduled turnaround expenses gain or loss on extinguishment of debt loss on disposition of assets expenses associated with the east dubuque merger and business interruption insurance recovery relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations when applicable each of these amounts is discussed in the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of our sec reports so that investors have complete information about these amounts we also present adjusted ebitda because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap and should not be substituted for net income loss or cash flows from operations management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders help investors and analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management ebitda and adjusted ebitda presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define these terms differently a reconciliation of consolidated net income loss to consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda is as follows three months ended june  six months

gaap available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income loss or operating income or any other measure of financial performance or operating performance in addition available cash for distribution is not presented as and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity available cash for distribution as reported by the partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure available cash begins with adjusted ebitda reduced for cash needed for i net cash interest expense excluding capitalized interest and debt service and other contractual obligations ii maintenance capital expenditures and iii to the extent applicable major scheduled turnaround expenses reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deems necessary or appropriate and expenses

accompanied by its pershare distribution falling from  in  to zero in  at the time of this writing shares were trading at all time lows and i believe now is a good time to take advantage of the recent weakness while it is difficult to locate the true bottom when nitrogen fertilizer prices rebound i believe cvr is one of the fertilizer stocks that will generate significant upside returns as well as resume distribution payments company background i figured i would begin this article with a bit of context around cvr partners lps business given the company seems to have been neglected by other seeking alpha contributors cvr partners lp is a limited partnership formed by cvr energy cvr partners lp has two manufacturing facilities one located in coffeyville kansas and the other in east dubuque illinois where it produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products which mainly includes ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate or uan for short fertilizers coffeyville facility the coffeyville facility began production in  and is the only plant in north america that uses a petroleum coke pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer the facility is also strategically located next to cvr refinings refinery which over the past five years has supplied over  of the pet coke consumed by the facility the company typically buys pet coke from cvr refining they purchase  of the pet coke produced for lower prices than they would otherwise pay to third parties they have been able to source the remainder of pet coke requirements from third parties at market prices they have a pet coke supply agreement that ends december  and it will be important to monitor their ability to purchase pet coke on comparable terms going forward their process allows them to convert the ammonia they produce into uan urea ammonium nitrate used as a fertilizer which demands a premium price during  about  ammonia produced was converted into uan east dubuque facility as a recent development cvr partners acquired rentech nitrogen partners on april st  and the primary plant is the east dubuque fertilizer plant this plant uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer and is conveniently located on the mississippi river and has access to a barge dock for loading purposes it is worth noting that fluctuations in natural gas prices can impact profitability but more recently cvr has benefitted from the fall in gas prices additionally the facility has the flexibility to vary its product mix depending on seasonality factors market demand and pricing however sales primarily consist of ammonia and uan demand markets seasonality and storage global fertilizer demand is influenced by a number of factors including grain demand population growth dietary changes and increased consumption of biofuels according to the international fertilizer industry association from  to  global fertilizer demand grew  on an annualized basis going forward over the  to  period according to the food and agricultural organization of the united nations global fertilizer is expected to increase by  furthermore developed market populations are transitioning to more proteinoriented diets thereby increasing demand for grain for animal feed chinas wheat and coarse grains production increased an estimated  from  to  and is still struggling to satisfy demand as a result china increased wheat and coarse grain imports by over  over this period according to the united states department of agriculture the united states is also the largest coarse grains exporter accounting for  of global exports as of september  the fertilizer business is seasonal with the heavy demand periods occurring in spring and fall in the corn belt which includes illinois indiana iowa minnesota missouri nebraska ohio and wisconsin states as well as in the summer in the the wheat belt which includes kansas north dakota oklahoma south dakota and texas states the first half of the calendar year tends to have higher net sales which cvr refers to as the planting season and the second half of the year tends to have lower net sales which cvr refers to as the fill season to meet demand during these periods they will allow inventories to accumulate and they have capacity to store  tons of uan and  tons of ammonia in storage tanks located at their two production facilities demand is further impacted by planting and fertilizer application rate decisions on farmers that make decisions based on crop prices soil conditions weather patterns etc competition competition in the fertilizer industry is fierce price is the determining factor however during high demand periods of increased farming activities delivery capacity becomes a material differentiating factor to best accommodate demand cvr seasonally adjusts its inventory and owns a leased railcar fleet notable competitors include potash agrium cf industries holdings and koch nitrogen company additionally there is foreign competition from international producers that export to the united states however fertilizer is very costly to export with long delivery times which poses a challenge for internationals to compete with a conveniently located producer such as cvr located in close proximity to the corn and wheat belts cvrs location within the us farm belt is in many instances closer to the end user than other domestic competitors that incur greater costs in transporting fertilizer over long distances key operating statistics ive included a snapshot of cvrs operating statistics for the past five years at the very bottom in the market indicators section you can see how ammonium and uan prices have declined source cvr partners lp balance sheet in conjunction with the east dubuque merger on april   cvr incurred additional indebtedness the acquisition was driven by the decision to diversify production processes whereby cvr acquired rentech nitrogen partners which operated a facility east dubuque that uses natural gas as the main input to produce nitrogen fertilizer in june  cvr issued  million of  notes which was necessary to complete the transaction although was costly in the short term the merger allows cvr to capitalize on low natural gas prices as their competitors have been able to enjoy and to further benefit from a recovery in nitrogen fertilizer prices however following the merger as of the first quarter of  interest expenses stood at  million which is equivalent to just under  per share assuming  per quarter this adds up to  per share for the year  which is not immaterial for reference interest payments as of the first quarter of  were just  million that being said throughout the fertilizer bear market cvr has remained cash flow positive and the balance sheet is stable source cvr partners lp risks there is risk nitrogen fertilizer prices will continue to fall cvr incurs significant fixed costs to operate their two plants and if fertilizer prices fall below a certain level profitability and ability to make distributions going forward would be negatively impacted cvr primarily produces uan urea ammonium nitrate which has historically demanded a premium over other fertilizers however in recent quarters this premium has decreased additionally cvrs pet coke production process employed by the coffeyville facility served as a competitive edge for cheaper production while competitors used more expensive natural gas todays low natural gas prices have taken away some of cvrs advantage from their cost effective pet coke process however the east dubuque plant acquired in april  uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer whereby low natural gas prices are beneficial for the year  the top five customers accounted for  of net sales with the top two customers accounting for  while this is high customer concentration a single customer loss would not have material operational effects unlike other industries cvr does not have longterm minimum purchase contracts with their customers this is industry practice the company is exposed to extensive regulatory risk while it is difficult to identify a true bottom and prices may be volatile over the next  months i believe now is the time to buy cvr partners ahead of a rebound in nitrogen fertilizer prices cvrs balance sheet is stable for the nearterm if prices remain low but i believe the stock will generate significant upside returns in the event of a recovery in prices disclosure i amwe are long uan i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving
