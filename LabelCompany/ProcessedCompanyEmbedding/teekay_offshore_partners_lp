helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why teekay offshore partners lp teekay lng partners lp and teekay corporation stocks soared in march the teekay family of partnerships and companies had a bounceback month in march heres why jason hall tmfvelvethammer apr   at am energy shipping is in a weak cycle eventually it will recover and teekay investors should do well image source teekay  what shares of several stocks that are part of the teekay corporation nysetk family including teekay teekay lng partners lp nysetgp and teekay offshore partners lp nysetoo were up big in march tk data by ycharts teekay tankers ltd nysetnk was the only teekay stock to finish march on a down note so what the markets exuberance for teekay and particularly teekay offshore and teekay lng partners is more a reaction to no more bad news than it was anything good thats happened even after the strong market gains in march shares of all of the teekay family stocks are still well down for the year tk data by ycharts its tied to several things first theres significant concern that the prospects for much of teekays business which is heavily tied to shipping of energy products such as crude oil propane and liquefied natural gas are facing strong headwinds this is tied to weak demand for shipping of oil and refined products in the near future as global demand continues to be relatively weak and economic uncertainty especially in parts of asia including china weighs on energy markets there are also fears that the expectations for huge growth in lng shipping could be overly optimistic  the nearterm weakness was a key reason that teekay teekay lng partners and teekay offshore all slashed their dividend and distribution payouts late last year sending income investors fleeing the stocks to find higheryield income another driver behind the payout cut was the ongoing weakness in the equity markets which presented a challenge for teekay lng and teekay offshore which have used equity offerings in the past to raise capital the decline in the stock prices for these partnerships had pushed the yields up so high that equity offerings as a source of capital were simply no longer costeffective  now what uncertain demand for lng shipping could weigh on teekay lng for some time image source teekay lng partners while theres still some uncertainty about nearterm demand the dividend cuts from last year helped free up a lot of cash flows that teekay can use to fund capital plans and support operations at the same time the teekay family recently declared upcoming dividend payments and held payouts steady at the levels announced in late  so there dont appear to be any forthcoming cuts  at the same time its likely that the teekay family of stocks will remain very volatile moving up and down with energy prices as much as real news as things stand today teekay corporation stock yields about  based on the current dividend while teekay offshore yields about  and teekay lng yields  looking ahead several years its likely that these prices turn out to be more than fair and you could be collecting much larger payouts on your initial investment nonetheless theres also reason to expect the share prices to continue moving up and down and you could certainly see them fall lower than current levels in the short term theres also the potential that if the biggest fears come true and demand for energy shipping further weakens or if lng growth doesnt pan out dividend cuts could happen again  but if youre willing to stomach the shortterm volatility and the cyclical nature of shipping in general a longterm investment in almost any of the teekay family of stocks could turn out very well in a few years time  jason hall has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned try any of our foolish newsletter services free for  days we fools may not
