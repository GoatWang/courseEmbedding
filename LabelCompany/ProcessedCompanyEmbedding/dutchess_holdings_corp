holdings corp notes to condensed financial statements   note   organization and business   business activity   dutchess holdings corp “the company” was incorporated in the state of delaware on august   with the objective to acquire or merge with an operating business   the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly traded corporation the company’s principal business objective over the next twelve months and beyond will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict its potential target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location the analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the company   note   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted for interim financial statements presentation and in accordance with the instructions to regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statement presentation in the opinion of management all adjustments for a fair statement of the results of operations and financial position for the interim periods presented have been included all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature the accompanying condensed financial statements and the information included under the heading management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited financial statements and related notes included in the company’s form k as of march   interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year   use of estimates   the preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash equivalents   the company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents there are no cash equivalents at the condensed balance sheet date   income taxes   the company utilizes the accrual method of accounting for income taxes under the accrual method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse an allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized                    dutchess holdings corp notes to condensed financial statements   the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination for tax positions meeting a “morelikely thannot” threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority for tax positions not meeting the threshold no financial statement benefit is recognized the company recognizes interest and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense as of december   the company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions   loss per common share    basic loss per share is calculated using the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during each reporting period diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period the company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments for the periods presented    emerging growth company    the company is an “emerging growth company” and has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows the company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies   recent accounting pronouncements   in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no  to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements in accordance with that pronouncement we have elected to adopt the elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including the presentation of inceptiontodate information in the statements of operations cash flows and stockholder’s deficiency and labeling the financial statements as those of a development stage entity    management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements if adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements   note   going concern   the accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business   the company has incurred losses from inception of approximately  and has negative working capital of approximately  as of december   which among other factors raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management’s plan to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate raise additional capital from the sales of stock and receive loans from related parties the accompanying condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note   income taxes   as of december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  subject
