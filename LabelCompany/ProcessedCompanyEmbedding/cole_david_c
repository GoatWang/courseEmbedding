mauis push for highend tourists has yielded not only a desired visitor boom but also escalating housing costs workforce constraints and a throttled infrastructure does maui land  pine have the fix scott radway october  maui land  pine’s david c cole at times can sound more like a preacher than a chief executive officer though one who calls upon the almighty bar chart not the good book to lead people to his promised land in the company compound in kahului on a sunny summer day the bushygoateed cole is speaking of the future of maui land  pine co inc amex mlp his buzz words are holistic communities and sustainability and cole is talking about core values preserving cultural heritage building affordable housing and setting aside land for schools is that the business of one of the state’s largest publicly traded companies a company that was losing millions when cole was brought on in  to jumpstart operations “we’re not missionaries” begins cole chairman ceo and president of mlp “we are just playing to cards we were dealt the best way we can” this is where the bar charts come in what cole and mlp are facing is the same dilemma faced by every growing business on maui property values have skyrocketed and low to even middleincome workers often can’t afford to buy a decent home the median sales price for a singlefamily home on maui in june  was  according to the realtors association of maui in june  the median price was  that’s a staggering increase of  percent in five years then consider that the unemployment rate on maui this year has hovered in the extremely low  percentile range the economy on maui is booming but in its wake have come skyrocketing housing costs and workforce scarcity a double whammy due in part to the maui’s effectiveness in drawing highend tourists some of whom end up buying a second home and arguably pricing locals out of the market more than on any other hawaiian island in repeated interviews about the state of the economy maui leaders beamed about the general good health across the sectors particularly in the hightech however maui continues to face a strained infrastructure and leaders all say the no  and no  concerns about economic growth on the valley isle and its neighbor islands are escalating housing costs and a dwindling workforce pool as locals leave and potential newcomers are discouraged by the price of land no sector is unscathed jeanne skog executive director of the maui economic development board says she recently asked a hightech company official how she could help him market a primary function of the board “he said ‘you get me the work force i can get the work” recalls skog to grow maui businesses need to think about how to attract people to work even in decentpaying middlemanagement positions “we are bidding on scarce resources” cole says that’s how landrich mlp got into the business of building affordable housing and developing schools “we want to become the employer of choice” cole says “that means understanding what is important to people in their prime earning and childbearing years that is unquestionably no  having quality housing no  it is having educational opportunities for their children” rippling underneath the surface of the housing and workforce concerns are also concerns about the fading of the community character itself if locals can’t afford to live here what happens to the aloha cole is not the only one talking about what needs to be done in a sense to recover from these economic good times hey big spender it’s a boom one of the first things terryl vencl executive director of the maui visitors bureau points out is that it has been more than a decade since maui has added a resort hotel not since the ritzcarlton kapalua was built in  several years back maui decided the best avenue to grow tourism was not to attract more numbers but bigger spenders the industry term is highend tourism at the same time maui has more than other counties put financial resources into targeting visitors and building its brand name typically she says county bureaus run on a set allocation from the state transient accommodation tax alone but maui county funnels some of its county funding from the tat to the bureau as well that means maui has more money for such things as targeting the avid traveler who understands the uniqueness of a destination and will pay extra for it and markets such as the romance market which spends more than any other niche market that also means maui has funds to develop travel agents who understand maui and sell it to the “cream of the crop” vencl says maui’s marketing strategies have paid off this year maui appears fully recovered from the blows of  and sars and is experiencing a  percent increase in visitors through june building on a halfpercent increase in  and a  percent increase in  those visitors set the occupancy rate for hotels at  percent for january through june  maui’s average daily room rates for  are the highest in the islands at  in comparison oahu has a  daily room rate this year barring a few unforeseen events those numbers which are largely driven by domestic tourism should persist and the tourist industry strength is also propelling and should continue to propel blazing construction and real estate industries one statistical measure of construction industry health is the estimated value of private construction permits tracking that number from  the value drops from  million to  million in  then it jumps up to  million in  and  million in  the industry is largely being driven by residential building demonstrated by the vast majority of new permits issued in that category the escalating prices of real estate have not decreased the volume of sales so the overall health of the market remains good however according to first hawaiian bank’s  report maui county flourishing again in  construction and real estate are not the only sectors doing well the service sectors “professional business and medical” are strong high tech in maui is also becoming an economic highlight in the long view from  to the present high tech has gone from employing  people to  a graph medb uses to illustrate how far high tech has come compares the revenue from high tech to large companies on maui high tech created  million in revenues in  compared to hawaii commercial  sugar co at  million and waileamakena resorts at  million medb reports this coming year plans are to expand the hightech park as a new squarefoot building are out for bid and boeing is expanding its facilities atop haleakala “and after  none of our companies were affected” skog says they behaved as we had hoped” the tab for success the sun rising over haleakala crater as it awakens the volcanic red swirls and spears the clouds at  feet is a rare spiritual event problem is some visitors are watching it from their idling cars “we can’t have visitors waiting a halfhour for parking stalls” says maui mayor alan arakawa the boom in tourism has introduced unwanted issues for both visitors and residents much has been written about infrastructure issues in particular transportation and water woes for maui the increasing number of cruiseship visits the conversion of homes into illegal rentals and the timeshare trend have also created new issues for maui to manage the issue of carrying capacity though–best illustrated by the maui signature experience of the haleakala sunrise now touched by traffic concerns–has brought the issue to new heights literally and figuratively arakawa has created a committee to research the full impact of cruise ships on maui those issues range from the direct impact on traffic at visitor sites to financial considerations because it is unclear whether cruise ships are contributing their fair share of tax dollars to maui to deal with their impact a report is expected out this fall the mayor is also studying the economic impact of a market trend of converting hotel rooms to timeshare it is unknown how that change in visitor profile will impact maui’s push to get fewer visitors who spend more maui has already instituted a property tax on timeshares to address infrastructure impacts a big issue for businesses on maui says maui chamber of commerce president stacie thorlakson is illegal rentals on the wave of tourism strength maui has seen a conversion of homes into rentals units primarily by outofstate investors thorlakson says unlike hotels which pay a tax to support managing visitor impact these rentals are under the radar “one of our major issues is regulating vacation rentals” says thorlakson “our members want to put a tax on folks who own such rentals as unpermitted bed and breakfasts they want an even playing field” but thorlakson too says the no  issue for maui businesses is still affordable housing with workforce concerns in tow for his part the firstterm mayor says he has aggressively worked since his election to solve the affordable housing dilemma arakawa has worked with developers to add components to their projects that he believes will meet the demand for affordable housing before the end of  arakawa says  units will be built in the next five years that fall in the affordablehousing category john stephens president of the realtors association of maui says the mayor’s initiative for affordable housing is a positive development however he worries about new trends such as the potential arrival of chinese investors while the housing market might eventually cool on the mainland it might not on maui he says “the question is whether there is another thing looming out there” stephens says “and whether we can keep up we need to build more houses we need land reform it is very difficult to tell local people they cannot afford a home” the long view hawaii tourism was founded on the advent of cheap oil and fast airplanes seemingly overnight hawaii became a major tourist attraction in a mad scurry to respond to the demand hotels were built on the beach side by side “instead of a beach experience it almost became an urban experience” says cole “a lot of resort areas that came alive on cheap oil and fast airplanes ended up feeling that way whether it was acapulco rio de janeiro miami beach or waikiki i think that has about played itself out” cole believes maui’s future and the future of hawaii as a state lie way upmarket “if you are looking for sand and rumbased drinks they are a better value elsewhere” cole says other places can offer beautiful vistas but only hawaii has the aloha mlp’s plan for the recently acquired kapalua bay resort is to target culturally sensitive tourists who are looking for a unique experience and are willing to pay for it something that builds upon maui’s work over the last several years but mlp is taking it to another level “if you want to know what the kapalua customer of the future looks like it is somebody who shops in whole foods a retailer of natural and organic foods on the west coast that is our customer he is wearing a patagonia shirt and reading coastal living magazine and he is not price sensitive” cole says “we want to be ruthlessly discriminating” mvb executive director vencl agrees and says campaigns to develop more cultural tourism and agriculture tourism are geared toward that kind of traveler the philosophy in maui today is to maintain market share when it comes to visitors not expand she says the business sector in maui also seems keenly aware of issues of sustainability “balance” says the chamber of commerce’s thorlakson “that is the word everyone is looking for right now” in mlp’s case the company is investing land and big dollars into creating balance on  acres of mlp land north of lahaina the pulelehua project is a masterplanned community with  homes of which more than  percent will be affordable under federal guidelines that means  quality two and threebedroom homes ranging in price from  to  in one of the most expensive areas on the island employees would get preference in these fee simple offerings the market homes should range from  to  the project is expected to cost about  million in infrastructure improvements and  million in vertical construction the first homes are expected by  and the last in  the housing will also be close to the resort to cut down on crossisland traffic thirteen acres are also designated for a school on the tourism side mlp is spending  million to upgrade the resort and move upmarket with a new spa a beach club a golf course a mountain activity center and nature trails mlp agriculture operations are moving upscale too mlp is transitioning from the pineapple commodity market to the specialty market where customers are willing to pay more for a superior product in fact the same customer that might buy the company’s fresh fruit might also visit its resort cole says the idea is the same it may cost more to do business but people will pay more if the product is special that’s why cultural preservation is good for the tourism business too he says cole is a kamaaina and admits it gives him great personal pleasure to work for the betterment of hawaii as a whole in fact that is largely why he took the job and returned to the islands but hawaii’s culture is also what makes its tourism special–and marketable “without the local culture we lose our distinctiveness it’s very different from being a missionary” cole says “as a business we want to make money “at some point you move from a rural authentic hawaiian vacation experience into something that is closer to fighting through the traffic jams of los angeles or coping with the societal disturbances that come from a concentration of wealth where you feel threatened by those that are the havenots that doesn’t suit anyone go to haiti and you sense that there are a lot of places where the hospitality model has failed through exploitation and greed and shortsightedness” cole says it’s time to take the long view of progress in the islands and plan for decades of success in large part by business investing in the people in hawaii but will his stockholders understand that thinking “maui land  pine stock is no stock for an impatient investor” cole says it doesn’t hurt that mlp’s largest shareholder is cole’s friend and business partner steve case “i don’t want them my shareholders understand this my colleagues understand this my family understands this it is time to get down to core values” can he get an amen click to share on facebook
