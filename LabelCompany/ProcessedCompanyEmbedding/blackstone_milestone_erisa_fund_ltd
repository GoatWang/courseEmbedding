practicing in federal circuit courts across the us representing disability claimants and life insurance beneficiaries we at erisa law center handle cases in all us courts of appeal these courts handle cases related to the employee retirement income security act erisa erisa provides legal recourse for employees dealing with denied or terminated disability health care life insurance and pension benefits depending on where you live and work or where your employer is based your case will be heard in an appellate court this venue and the presiding judge may have more of an impact on your erisa case than you would think erisa is a federal law and is supposed to be a uniform system of national law it isnt while erisa statutes havent changed very much since the law was adopted in  courts around the country have interpreted and applied that law differently supreme court decisions on erisa law are binding everywhere but decisions by the  geographic circuit courts of appeal which have jurisdiction over erisa cases are controlling only within the jurisdiction of that circuit in a lot of areas of erisa law circuits have adopted different legal standards some circuits seem to favor claimants more than others what can be drawn from a review of case law from around the country erisa law can strongly favor insurance companies and plans depending on the factual and legal issues operating in your case some circuits may offer more favorable treatment than others whats certain is that its not as simple as saying one circuit is better than another  it will depend on a number of factors we recover benefits or a settlement for  of our clients to discuss your situation during a free consultation call us  at   or fill out the form name please enter your name email this isnt a valid email address please enter your email phone this isnt a valid phone number please enter your phone number message please enter a message are you a new client yes no i’m neither please make a selection get started now you pay nothing unless we get you benefits or a settlement get in touch now our lawyer is experienced in all circuit courts with the experience of litigating in all circuit courts comes a nuanced perspective about what issues work best where for instance the ninth circuit is not antagonistic to claims of disability based on fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome the fourth circuit has joined that position the sixth circuit is very good if you are attacking the credibility of defense doctors the fifth and tenth circuits have very clear rules for allowable discovery in the event of a conflict of interest the seventh circuit is best if you have de novo review on the other hand the second circuit allows insurance companies to introduce new rationales to deny benefits in litigation the eighth circuit has rejected arguments that it is improper to demand objective evidence in cases of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome the law is not the only issue that drives litigation insurance companies do pay more for claims based on locale generally cases in urban areas and coastal jurisdictions tend to pay better values when negotiating a settlement than the same claim in omaha kansas city or indianapolis the differences in law from circuit to circuit could be important in your case there are three primary proper venues for filing an erisa benefits lawsuit  where you live  where your plan is administered usually your employer is the officially designated plan administrator and the employers principal place of business is where the plan is administered and  where some other defendant has its principal place of business in many circuits a proper defendant in an erisa benefits claim is the insurance company which insures the claims usually the best venue to file an erisa benefits claim is in the district court where you live which may provide you with a subtle and unspoken home court advantage in any number of ways since the law varies from circuit to circuit however you might better be off suing in california or nevada where your employers plan is administered rather than in louisiana or connecticut where you live because ninth circuit law  which is the law that controls in nevada and california  may be more favorable to your case than fifth circuit law which controls louisiana or second circuit law which controls connecticut the circuit summaries on this website are not intended to be comprehensive summaries of the law they are simply our observations about certain important features of erisa law and practice

and life insurance beneficiaries we at erisa law center handle cases in all us courts of appeal these courts handle cases related to the employee retirement income security act erisa erisa provides legal recourse for employees dealing with denied or terminated disability health care life insurance and pension benefits depending on where you live and work or where your employer is based your case will be heard in an appellate court this venue and the presiding judge may have more of an impact on your erisa case than you would think erisa is a federal law and is supposed to be a uniform system of national law it isnt while erisa statutes havent changed very much since the law was adopted in  courts around the country have interpreted and applied that law differently supreme court decisions on erisa law are binding everywhere but decisions by the  geographic circuit courts of appeal which have jurisdiction over erisa cases are controlling only within the jurisdiction of that circuit in a lot of areas of erisa law circuits have adopted different legal standards some circuits seem to favor claimants more than others what can be drawn from a review of case law from around the country erisa law can strongly favor insurance companies and plans depending on the factual and legal issues operating in your case some circuits may offer more favorable treatment than others whats certain is that its not as simple as saying one circuit is better than another  it will depend on a number of factors we recover benefits or a settlement for  of our clients to discuss your situation during a

our lawyer is experienced in all circuit courts with the experience of litigating in all circuit courts comes a nuanced perspective about what issues work best where for instance the ninth circuit is not antagonistic to claims of disability based on fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome the fourth circuit has joined that position the sixth circuit is very good if you are attacking the credibility of defense doctors the fifth and tenth circuits have very clear rules for allowable discovery in the event of a conflict of interest the seventh circuit is best if you have de novo review on the other hand the second circuit allows insurance companies to introduce new rationales to deny benefits in litigation the eighth circuit has rejected arguments that it is improper to demand objective evidence in cases of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome the law is not the only issue that drives litigation insurance companies do pay more for claims based on locale generally cases in urban areas and coastal jurisdictions tend to pay better values when negotiating a settlement than the same claim in omaha kansas city or indianapolis the differences in law from circuit to circuit could be important in your case there are three primary proper venues for filing an erisa benefits lawsuit  where you live  where your plan is administered usually your employer is the officially designated plan administrator and the employers principal place of business is where the plan is administered and  where some other defendant has its principal place of business in many circuits a proper defendant in an erisa benefits claim is the insurance company which insures the claims usually the best venue to file an erisa benefits claim is in the district court where you live which may provide you with a subtle and unspoken home court advantage in any number of ways since the law varies from circuit to circuit however you might better be off suing in california or nevada where your employers plan is administered rather than in louisiana or connecticut where you live because ninth circuit law  which is the law that controls in nevada and california  may be more favorable to your case than fifth circuit law which controls louisiana or second circuit law which controls connecticut the circuit summaries on this website are not intended to be comprehensive summaries of the law they are simply our observations about certain important features of erisa law and practice in these circuits if you really want to understand where your case should be brought in the event of
