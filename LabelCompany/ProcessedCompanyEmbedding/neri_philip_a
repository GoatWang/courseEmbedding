 beatified by may   by pope paul v canonized by march   by pope gregory xv take the saints trivia quiz now st philip neri was a christian missionary and founder of the congregation of the oratory a community of catholic priests and lay brothers he was born in florence on july   as one of four children to francesco neri from a very young age philip was known for being cheerful and obedient he was affectionately referred to as good little phil he received his early teachings from friars at the dominican monastery in florence san marco at yearsold philip went off to live with a wealthy family member in san germano he was sent there to assist in  and possibly inherit  the family business however soon after his arrival philip experienced a mystical vision which he eventually spoke of as his christian conversion this event was an encounter with the lord and it dramatically changed his life he soon lost interest in owning property or participating in business he felt a call from the holy spirit to radically live for and serve the lord jesus christ and his church so philip set out for rome once in rome philip was the livein tutor for a fellow florentines sons under philips guidance the two boys improved in all aspects of life and faith proving philips special talent with human relationships and in bringing out the best in people during his first two years in rome philip spent his time in a solitary life he also dedicated a lot of time to prayer he ate very small meals of bread water and a few vegetables practicing an ascetical life in  philip began studying theology and philosophy at the sapienza and at st augustines monastery although he was considered a promising scholar after three years of studies philip gave up any thought of ordination he set out to help the poor people of rome and to reevangelize the city sadly rome had lost its first love and its inhabitants were no longer really living as christians he began talking to people on street corners and in public squares he made acquaintances in places where people commonly gathered philip compared to socrates had a knack for starting up conversations and leading his listeners to consider a new and better way of life the christian way he easily caught others attention with his warm personality and incredible sense of humor he encouraged groups of people to gather for discussions studies prayer and the enjoyment of music his customary question was always well brothers when shall we begin to do good losing no time in converting good conversation to good actions philip would lead his followers to hospitals to wait on the sick or to the church to pray to and encounter jesus christ in short philip was an evangelist he loved to share the gospel and help people to find or rediscover their faith in jesus christ his days were dedicated to helping others but his nights were set aside for solitude spent praying in the church or in the catacombs beside the appian way in  on the eve of pentecost philip saw what appeared to be a globe of fire it is said the fire entered his mouth causing philip to feel his heart dilate philip was filled with such paroxysms of divine love that caused him to scream out enough enough lord i can bear no more philip then discovered a swelling over his heart though it caused him no pain in  with the help of his confessor father persiano rossa philip founded a confraternity for poor laymen to meet for spiritual exercises and service of the poor the confraternity of the most holy trinity philips appealing nature won him over friends from all societal levels including that of ignatius of loyola pius v and charles borromeo at yearsold philip had already accomplished so much but his confessor was determined that his work would be more effective as a priest finally convinced philip was ordained to the diaconate and then to the priesthood on may   from there philip went to live with father rossa and other priests at san girolamo and carried on his mission but mostly through the confessional before sun up until sun down philip spent hours sitting and listening to people of all ages sometimes philip broke out informal discussions for those who desired to live a better life he spoke to them about jesus the saints and the martyrs influenced by st francis xavier philip thought of going to india to join the foreign mission field but was dissuaded by his peers because rome still needed philips ministry and influence a large room was built above the church of san girolamo to tend to philips growing number of pilgrims and other priests were called on to assist him philip and the priests were soon called the oratorians because they would ring a bell to call the faithful in their oratory the foundation of the congregation of the priests of the oratory would be laid a few years later with members who encouraged others to deepen their faith philips rule for them was simple  share a common table and to perform spiritual exercises philip didnt want his followers to bind themselves to the life with a vow and he did not want them to denounce their property philips organization was officially approved by pope gregory xiii in  the congregation was given an ancient church but philip made the quick decision to demolish it because the structure was in ruins and the size was not large enough he had plans of rebuilding on a larger scale people from all over including charles borromeo and pope gregory contributed financially toward the rebuilding by april  the new church was completed enough for the congregation of the oratory to be transferred there but philip stayed at san girolamo for another seven years philip was constantly in a crowd of people he allowed his followers free access to him and continued hearing confessions and engaging in ministry and prayer in the words of one of his biographers philip was all things to all men when he was called upon to be merry he was so if there was a demand upon his sympathy he was equally ready philip was respected and loved throughout rome he became a trusted advisor to popes kings cardinals and equally as important to the poor he wholeheartedly desired the reform of the catholic church and worked toward that with a sense of gentleness and friendship rather than criticism and harshness his efforts to reach out to the lay people of rome and not simply associate with the clergy made him one of the great figures in the counter reformation of the catholic church sadly the catholic church had fallen into clericalism he soon earned the title apostle of rome on the feast of corpus christi may   philip was told by his physician that he was not healthy he had not looked well for ten years philip realized his time had come to pass on to the lord for the remainder of the day he listened to confessions and saw his visitors as normal before heading off to bed philip stated last of all we must die around midnight of may   philip suffered from a hemorrhage and passed away at yearsold his body lays in the new church where the oratorians still serve st philip neri was beatified by pope paul v on may   and canonized by pope gregory xv on march   he is the patron saint of rome us special forces humor and joy and his feast day is celebrated on may  ← st philip minh van doan st philip of agirone → st philip neri products by catholic online shopping saints fun facts  st philip neri free

paul was an italian priest noted for founding a society of secular clergy called the congregation of the oratory often abbreviated cong orat contents  early life  founding of the oratory  missions work  confraternity of the holy trinity  congregation of the oratory  political activity  character  death and veneration  oratory  in popular culture  see also  references  sources  biographies  external links early lifeedit he was the son of francesco di neri a lawyer and his wife lucrezia da mosciano whose family were nobility in the service of the italian state he was carefully brought up and received his early teaching from the friars at san marco the famous dominican monastery in florence he was accustomed in later life to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them zenobio de medici and servanzio mini at the age of  philip was sent to his uncle romolo a wealthy merchant at san germano a neapolitan town near the base of monte cassino to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit his uncles fortune he gained romolos confidence and affection but soon after coming to san germano philip had a religious conversion he no longer cared for things of the world and chose to relocate to rome in  founding of the oratoryedit missions workedit after arriving in rome neri became a tutor in the house of a florentine aristocrat named galeotto caccia after two years he began to pursue his own studies for a period of three years under the guidance of the augustinians following this he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which in later life gained him the title of apostle of rome he also ministered to the prostitutes of the city in  he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous traveling throughout the city seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them for seventeen years philip lived as a layman in rome probably without thinking of becoming a priest around  he made the acquaintance of ignatius of loyola many of neris disciples found their vocations in the infant society of jesus philip neri confraternity of the holy trinityedit in  together with his confessor persiano rossa neri founded the confraternity of the most holy trinity of pilgrims and convalescents italian santissima trinita de pellegrini e de convalescenti whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to rome especially in jubilee years and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labour members met for prayer at the church of san salvatore in campo where the devotion of the forty hours of exposition of the blessed sacrament was first introduced into rome  congregation of the oratoryedit in  neri received all the minor orders and was ordained deacon and finally priest on  may he thought of going to india as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in rome accordingly he settled down with some companions at the hospital of san girolamo della carità and while there tentatively began in  the institute with which his name is more especially connected that of the oratory the scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall the oratory at which there were prayers hymns and readings from scripture the church fathers and the martyrology followed by a lecture or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration the musical selections settings of scenes from sacred history were called oratorios giovanni palestrina was one of philip’s followers and composed music for the services the scheme was developed and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout rome notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening a completely new idea at that time he also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way neri sometimes led “excursions” to other churches often with music and a picnic on the way in  the florentines requested that neri leave san girolamo to oversee their newly built church in rome san giovanni dei fiorentini he was at first reluctant but by consent of pope pius iv he accepted while remaining in charge of san girolamo where the exercises of the oratory were kept up at this time the new society included among its members caesar baronius the ecclesiastical historian francesco maria tarugi afterwards archbishop of avignon and ottavio paravicini all three of whom were subsequently cardinals and also gallonius antonio gallonio author of a wellknown work on the sufferings of the martyrs ancina bordoni and other men of ability and distinction in  the florentines built a large oratory or missionroom for the society next to san giovanni in order to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from san girolamo and to provide a more convenient place of assembly and the headquarters were transferred there as the community grew and its mission work extended the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt and the offer of the small parish church of santa maria in vallicella conveniently situated in the middle of rome was made and accepted the building however not large enough for their purpose was pulled down and a splendid church erected on the site it was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that neri formally organized under permission of a papal bull dated  july  a community of secular priests called the congregation of the oratory the new church was consecrated early in  and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of san giovanni dei fiorentini neri himself did not leave san girolamo until  and then only by virtue of an injunction of the pope that he as the superior should reside at the chief house of his congregation he was at first elected for a term of three years as is usual in modern societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and without endeavouring for neri to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send out—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of gregory xv in  st philip neri and the virgin mary by tiepolo political activityedit although neri refrained from becoming involved in political matters he broke this rule in  when he persuaded pope clement viii to withdraw the excommunication and anathema laid on henry iv of france and the refusal to receive his ambassador even though the king had formally renounced calvinism neri saw that the popes attitude was more than likely to drive henry to a relapse and probably to rekindle the civil war in france and directed cardinal caesar baronius a member of the oratory who was then the popes confessor to refuse the pope absolution and to resign his office of confessor unless the pope would withdraw the anathema clement yielded at once though the whole college of cardinals had supported his policy and henry who did not learn the facts until several years afterwards testified lively gratitude for the timely and politic intervention neri continued in the government of the oratory until his death he was succeeded by baronius characteredit philip neri embodied a number of contradictions combining popular venerations with intensely individual piety he became embedded in the church hierarchy while seeking to reform a corrupt rome and an uninterested clergy he possessed a playful humour combined with a shrewd wit he considered a cheerful temper to be more christian than a melancholy one and carried this spirit into his whole life a joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one this was the secret of neris popularity and of his place in the folklore of the roman poor many miracles were attributed to him when his body was autopsied it was found that two of his ribs had been broken an event attributed to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year  benedict xiv who reorganised the rules for canonization decided that philips enlarged heart was caused by an aneurism ponnelle and bordet in their  biography st philip neri and the roman society of his times  conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural what is certain is that philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love practical commonplaceness says frederick william faber in his panegyric of neri was the special mark which distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day he looked like other men  he was emphatically a modern gentleman of scrupulous courtesy sportive gaiety acquainted with what was going on in the world taking a real interest in it giving and getting information very neatly dressed with a shrewd common sense always alive about him in a modern room with modern furniture plain it is true but with no marks of poverty about it—in a word with all the ease the gracefulness the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth considerable accomplishments and a very various information accordingly neri was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile jesuits who much desired to enlist him in their company did not rival and though an italian priest and head of a new religious order his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval frequent and popular preaching unconventional prayer and unsystematized albeit fervent private devotion neri prayed let me get through today and i shall not fear tomorrow neri had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his church being in truth an ardent ultramontane in doctrine as was all but inevitable in his time and circumstances and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life but that something more homely simple and everyday in character was needed for the new time death and venerationedit philip neris effigy at his tomb neri died around the end of the day on  may  the feast of corpus christi that year after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors about midnight he began hemorrhaging and baronius read the commendatory prayers over him baronius asked that he would bless his spiritual sons before dying and though he could no longer speak he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died neri was beatified by paul v in  and canonized by pope gregory xv in  his memorial is celebrated on  may his body is in the chiesa nuova new church in rome neri is one of the influential figures of the counterreformation mainly for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the church itself oratoryedit philip neri as painted by guercino in  main article oratory of saint philip neri the congregation neri founded is of the least conventional nature rather resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type and its rules never written by neri but approved by pope paul v in   would have appeared incredibly lax in fact its religious character would seem almost doubtful to men such as bruno stephen harding francis of assisi or saint dominic it admits only priests aged at least  or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination supported by lay brothers the members live in community and each pays his own expenses having the usufruct of his private means—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty they have indeed a common table but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess by monthly payments from each member nothing is provided by the society except the bare lodging and the fees of a visiting physician everything else—clothing books furniture medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member there are no vows and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw when he pleases and to take his property with him the government strikingly unlike the jesuit autocracy is of a republican form and the superior though first in honour has to take his turn in discharging all the duties which come to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority including that of waiting at table which is not entrusted in the oratory to lay brothers according to the practice in most other communities four deputies assist the superior in the government and all public acts are decided by a majority of votes of the whole congregation in which the superior has no casting voice to be chosen superior  years of membership are requisite as a qualification and the office is tenable as all the others for but  years at a time no one can vote until he has been three years in the society the deliberative voice is not obtained before the eleventh year statue of philip neri in congregados church braga portugal there are thus three classes of members novices triennials and decennials each house can call its superior to account can depose and can restore him without appeal to any external authority although the bishop of the diocese in which any house of the oratory is established is its ordinary and immediate superior though without power to interfere with the rule their churches are

famous dominican monastery in florence he was accustomed in later life to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them zenobio de medici and servanzio mini at the age of  philip was sent to his uncle romolo a wealthy merchant at san germano a neapolitan town near the base of monte cassino to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit his uncles fortune he gained romolos confidence and affection but soon after coming to san germano philip had a religious conversion he no longer cared for things of the world and chose to relocate to rome in  founding of the oratoryedit missions workedit after arriving in rome neri became a tutor in the house of a florentine aristocrat named galeotto caccia after two years he began to pursue his own studies for a period of three years under the guidance of the augustinians following this he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which in later life gained him the title of apostle of rome he also ministered to the prostitutes of the city in  he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous traveling throughout the city seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them for seventeen years philip lived as a layman in rome probably without thinking of becoming a priest around  he made the acquaintance of ignatius of loyola many of neris disciples found their vocations in the infant society of jesus philip neri confraternity of the holy trinityedit in  together with his confessor persiano rossa neri founded the confraternity of the most holy trinity of pilgrims and convalescents italian santissima trinita de pellegrini e de convalescenti whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to rome especially in jubilee years and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labour members met for prayer at the church of san salvatore in campo where the devotion of the forty hours of exposition of the blessed sacrament was first introduced into rome  congregation of the oratoryedit in  neri received all the minor orders and was ordained deacon and finally priest on  may he thought of going to india as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in rome accordingly he settled down with some companions at the hospital of san girolamo della carità and while there tentatively began in  the institute with which his name is more especially connected that of the oratory the scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall the oratory at which there were prayers hymns and readings from scripture the church fathers and the martyrology followed by a lecture or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration the musical selections settings of scenes from sacred history were called oratorios giovanni palestrina was one of philip’s followers and composed music for the services the scheme was developed and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout rome notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening a completely new idea at that time he also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way neri sometimes led “excursions” to other churches often with music and a picnic on the way in  the florentines requested that neri leave san girolamo to oversee their newly built church in rome san giovanni dei fiorentini he was at first reluctant but by consent of pope pius iv he accepted while remaining in charge of san girolamo where the exercises of the oratory were kept up at this time the new society included among its members caesar baronius the ecclesiastical historian francesco maria tarugi afterwards archbishop of avignon and ottavio paravicini all three of whom were subsequently cardinals and also gallonius antonio gallonio author of a wellknown work on the sufferings of the martyrs ancina bordoni and other men of ability and distinction in  the florentines built a large oratory or missionroom for the society next to san giovanni in order to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from san girolamo and to provide a more convenient place of assembly and the headquarters were transferred there as the community grew and its mission work extended the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt and the offer of the small parish church of santa maria in vallicella conveniently situated in the middle of rome was made and accepted the building however not large enough for their purpose was pulled down and a splendid church erected on the site it was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that neri formally organized under permission of a papal bull dated  july  a community of secular priests called the congregation of the oratory the new church was consecrated early in  and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of san giovanni dei fiorentini neri himself did not leave san girolamo until  and then only by virtue of an injunction of the pope that he as the superior should reside at the chief house of his congregation he was at first elected for a term of three years as is usual in modern societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and without endeavouring for neri to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send out—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of gregory xv in  st philip neri and the virgin mary by tiepolo political activityedit although neri refrained from becoming involved in political matters he broke this rule in  when he persuaded pope clement viii to withdraw the excommunication and anathema laid on henry iv of france and the refusal to receive his ambassador even though the king had formally renounced calvinism neri saw that the popes attitude was more than likely to drive henry to a relapse and probably to rekindle the civil war in france and directed cardinal caesar baronius a member of the oratory who was then the popes confessor to refuse the pope absolution and to resign his office of confessor unless the pope would withdraw the anathema clement yielded at once though the whole college of cardinals had supported his policy and henry who did not learn the facts until several years afterwards testified lively gratitude for the timely and politic intervention neri continued in the government of the oratory until his death he was succeeded by baronius characteredit philip neri embodied a number of contradictions combining popular venerations with intensely individual piety he became embedded in the church hierarchy while seeking to reform a corrupt rome and an uninterested clergy he possessed a playful humour combined with a shrewd wit he considered a cheerful temper to be more christian than a melancholy one and carried this spirit into his whole life a joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one this was the secret of neris popularity and of his place in the folklore of the roman poor many miracles were attributed to him when his body was autopsied it was found that two of his ribs had been broken an event attributed to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year  benedict xiv who reorganised the rules for canonization decided that philips enlarged heart was caused

himself and his penitents associated it with divine love practical commonplaceness says frederick william faber in his panegyric of neri was the special mark which distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day he looked like other men  he was emphatically a modern gentleman of scrupulous courtesy sportive gaiety acquainted with what was going on in the world taking a real interest in it giving and getting information very neatly dressed with a shrewd common sense always alive about him in a modern room with modern furniture plain it is true but with no marks of poverty about it—in a word with all the ease the gracefulness the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth considerable accomplishments and a very various information accordingly neri was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile jesuits who much desired to enlist him in their company did not rival and though an italian priest and head of a new religious order his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval frequent and popular preaching unconventional prayer and unsystematized albeit fervent private devotion neri prayed let me get through today and i shall not fear tomorrow neri had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his church being in truth an ardent ultramontane in doctrine as was all but inevitable in his time and circumstances and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life but that something more homely simple and everyday in character was needed for the new time death and venerationedit philip neris effigy at his tomb neri died around the end of the day on  may  the feast of corpus christi that year after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors about midnight he began hemorrhaging and baronius read the commendatory prayers over him baronius asked that he would bless his

influential people within the church itself oratoryedit philip neri as painted by guercino in  main article oratory of saint philip neri the congregation neri founded is of the least conventional nature rather resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type and its rules never written by neri but approved by pope paul v in   would have appeared incredibly lax in fact its religious character would seem almost doubtful to men such as bruno stephen harding francis of assisi or saint dominic it admits only priests aged at least  or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination supported by lay brothers the members live in community and each pays his own expenses having the usufruct of his private means—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty they have indeed a common table but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess by monthly payments from each member nothing is provided by the society except the bare lodging and the fees of a visiting physician everything else—clothing books furniture medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member there are no vows and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw when he pleases and to take his property with him the government strikingly unlike the jesuit autocracy is of a republican form and the superior though first in honour has to take his turn in discharging all the duties which come to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority including that of waiting at table which is not entrusted in the oratory to lay brothers according to the practice in most other communities four deputies assist the superior in the government and all public acts are decided by a majority of votes of the whole congregation in which the superior has no casting voice to be chosen superior  years of membership are requisite as a qualification and the office is tenable as all the others for but  years at a time no one can vote until he has been three years in the society the deliberative voice is not obtained before the eleventh year statue of philip neri in congregados church braga portugal there are thus three classes of members novices triennials and decennials each house can call its superior to account can depose and can restore him without appeal to any external authority although the bishop of the diocese in which any

a lawyer and his wife lucrezia da mosciano whose family were nobility in the service of the italian state he was carefully brought up and received his early teaching from the friars at san marco the famous dominican monastery in florence he was accustomed in later life to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them zenobio de medici and servanzio mini at the age of  philip was sent to his uncle romolo a wealthy merchant at san germano a neapolitan town near the base of monte cassino to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit his uncles fortune he gained romolos confidence and affection but soon after coming to san germano philip had a religious conversion he no longer cared for things of the world and chose to relocate to rome in  founding of the oratoryedit missions workedit after arriving in rome neri became a tutor in the house of a florentine aristocrat named galeotto caccia after two years he began to pursue his own studies for a period of three years under the guidance of the augustinians following this he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which in later life gained him the title of apostle of rome he also ministered to the prostitutes of the city in  he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous traveling throughout the city seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them for seventeen years philip lived as a layman in rome probably without thinking of becoming a priest around  he made the acquaintance of ignatius of loyola many of neris disciples found their vocations in the infant society of jesus philip neri confraternity of the holy trinityedit in  together with his confessor persiano rossa neri founded the confraternity of the most holy trinity of pilgrims and convalescents italian santissima trinita de pellegrini e de convalescenti whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to rome especially in jubilee years and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labour members met for prayer at the church of san salvatore in campo where the devotion of the forty hours of exposition of the blessed sacrament was first introduced into rome  congregation of the oratoryedit in  neri received all the minor orders and was ordained deacon and finally priest on  may he thought of going to india as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in rome accordingly he settled down with some companions at the hospital of san girolamo della carità and while there tentatively began in  the institute with which his name is more especially connected that of the oratory the scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall the oratory at which there were prayers hymns and readings from scripture the church fathers and the martyrology followed by a lecture or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration the musical selections settings of scenes from sacred history were called oratorios giovanni palestrina was one of philip’s followers and composed music for the services the scheme was developed and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout rome notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening a completely new idea at that time he also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way neri sometimes led “excursions” to other churches often with music and a picnic on the way in  the florentines requested that neri leave san girolamo to oversee their newly built church in rome san giovanni dei fiorentini he was at first reluctant but by consent of pope pius iv he accepted while remaining in charge of san girolamo where the exercises of the oratory were kept up at this time the new society included among its members caesar baronius the ecclesiastical historian francesco maria tarugi afterwards archbishop of avignon and ottavio paravicini all three of whom were subsequently cardinals and also gallonius antonio gallonio author of a wellknown work on the sufferings of the martyrs ancina bordoni and other men of ability and distinction in  the florentines built a large oratory or missionroom for the society next to san giovanni in order to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from san girolamo and to provide a more convenient place of assembly and the headquarters were transferred there as the community grew and its mission work extended the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt and the offer of the small parish church of santa maria in vallicella conveniently situated in the middle of rome was made and accepted the building however not large enough for their purpose was pulled down and a splendid church erected on the site it was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that neri formally organized under permission of a papal bull dated  july  a community of secular priests called the congregation of the oratory the new church was consecrated early in  and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of san giovanni dei fiorentini neri himself did not leave san girolamo until  and then only by virtue of an injunction of the pope that he as the superior should reside at the chief house of his congregation he was at first elected for a term of three years as is usual in modern societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and without endeavouring for neri to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send out—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of gregory xv in  st philip neri and the virgin mary by tiepolo political activityedit although neri refrained from becoming involved in political matters he broke this rule in  when he persuaded pope clement viii to withdraw the excommunication and anathema laid on henry iv of france and the refusal to receive his ambassador even though the king had formally renounced calvinism neri saw that the popes attitude was more than likely to drive henry to a relapse and probably to rekindle the civil war in france and directed cardinal caesar baronius a member of the oratory who was then the popes confessor to refuse the pope absolution and to resign his office of confessor unless the pope would withdraw the anathema clement yielded at once though the whole college of cardinals had supported his policy and henry who did not learn the facts until several years afterwards testified lively gratitude for the timely and politic intervention neri continued in the government of the oratory until his death he was succeeded by baronius characteredit philip neri embodied a number of contradictions combining popular venerations with intensely individual piety he became embedded in the church hierarchy while seeking to reform a corrupt rome and an uninterested clergy he possessed a playful humour combined with a shrewd wit he considered a cheerful temper to be more christian than a melancholy one and carried this spirit into his whole life a joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one this was the secret of neris popularity and of his place in the folklore of the roman poor many miracles were attributed to him when his body was autopsied it was found that two of his ribs had been broken an event attributed to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year  benedict xiv who reorganised the rules for canonization decided that philips enlarged heart was caused by an aneurism ponnelle and bordet in their  biography st philip neri and the roman society of his times  conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural what is certain is that philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love practical commonplaceness says frederick william faber in his panegyric of neri was the special mark which distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day he looked like other men  he was emphatically a modern gentleman of scrupulous courtesy sportive gaiety acquainted with what was going on in the world taking a real interest in it giving and getting information very neatly dressed with a shrewd common sense always alive about him in a modern room with modern furniture plain it is true but with no marks of poverty about it—in a word with all the ease the gracefulness the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth considerable accomplishments and a very various information accordingly neri was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile jesuits who much desired to enlist him in their company did not rival and though an italian priest and head of a new religious order his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval frequent and popular preaching unconventional prayer and unsystematized albeit fervent private devotion neri prayed let me get through today and i shall not fear tomorrow neri had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his church being in truth an ardent ultramontane in doctrine as was all but inevitable in his time and circumstances and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life but that something more homely simple and everyday in character was needed for the new time death and venerationedit philip neris effigy at his tomb neri died around the end of the day on  may  the feast of corpus christi that year after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors about midnight he began hemorrhaging and baronius read the commendatory prayers over him baronius asked that he would bless his spiritual sons before dying and though he could no longer speak he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died neri was beatified by paul v in  and canonized by pope gregory xv in  his memorial is celebrated on  may his body is in the chiesa nuova new church in rome neri is one of the influential figures of the counterreformation mainly for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the church itself oratoryedit philip neri as painted by guercino in  main article oratory of saint philip neri the congregation neri founded is of the least conventional nature rather resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type and its rules never written by neri but approved by pope paul v in   would have appeared incredibly lax in fact its religious character would seem almost doubtful to men such as bruno stephen harding francis of assisi or saint dominic it admits only priests aged at least  or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination supported by lay brothers the members live in community and each pays his own expenses having the usufruct of his private means—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty they have indeed a common table but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess by monthly payments from each member nothing is provided by the society except the bare lodging and the fees of a visiting physician everything else—clothing books furniture medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member there are no vows and every member of the society is at

spiritual sons before dying and though he could no longer speak he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died neri was beatified by paul v in  and canonized by pope gregory xv in  his memorial is celebrated on  may his body is in the chiesa nuova new church in rome neri is one of the influential figures of the counterreformation mainly for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the church itself oratoryedit philip neri as painted by guercino in  main article oratory of saint philip neri the congregation neri founded is of the least conventional nature rather resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type and its rules never written by neri but approved by pope paul v in   would have appeared incredibly lax in fact its religious character would seem almost doubtful to men such as bruno stephen harding francis of assisi or saint dominic it admits only priests aged at least  or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination supported by lay brothers the members live in community and each pays his own expenses having the usufruct of his private means—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty they have indeed a common table but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess by monthly payments from each member nothing is provided by the society except the bare lodging and the fees of a visiting physician everything else—clothing books furniture medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member there are no vows and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw when he pleases and to take his property with him the government strikingly unlike the jesuit autocracy is of a republican form and the superior though first in honour has to take his turn in discharging all the duties which come to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority including that of waiting at table which is not entrusted in the oratory to lay brothers according to the practice in most other communities four deputies assist the superior in the government and all public acts are decided by a majority of votes of the whole congregation in which the superior has no casting voice to be chosen superior  years of membership are requisite as a qualification and the office is tenable as all the others for but  years at a time no one can vote until he has been three years in the society the deliberative voice is not obtained before the eleventh year statue of philip neri in congregados church braga portugal there are thus three classes of members novices triennials and decennials each house can call its superior to account can depose and can restore him without appeal to any external authority although the bishop of the diocese in which any house of the oratory is established is its ordinary and immediate superior though without power to interfere with the rule their churches are nonparochial and they can perform such rites as baptisms marriages etc only by permission of the parish priest who is entitled to receive all fees due in respect of these ministrations the oratory chiefly spread in italy and in france where in  there were

carefully brought up and received his early teaching from the friars at san marco the famous dominican monastery in florence he was accustomed in later life to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them zenobio de medici and servanzio mini at the age of  philip was sent to his uncle romolo a wealthy merchant at san germano a neapolitan town near the base of monte cassino to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit his uncles fortune he gained romolos confidence and affection but soon after coming to san germano philip had a religious conversion he no longer cared for things of the world and chose to relocate to rome in  founding of the oratoryedit missions workedit after arriving in rome neri became a tutor in the house of a florentine aristocrat named galeotto caccia after two years he began to pursue his own studies for a period of three years under the guidance of the augustinians following this he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which in later life gained him the title of apostle of rome he also ministered to the prostitutes of the city in  he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous traveling throughout the city seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them for seventeen years philip lived as a layman in rome probably without thinking of becoming a priest around  he made the acquaintance of ignatius of loyola many of neris disciples found their vocations in the infant society of jesus philip neri confraternity of the holy trinityedit in  together with his confessor persiano rossa neri founded the confraternity of the most holy trinity of pilgrims and convalescents italian santissima trinita de pellegrini e de convalescenti whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to rome especially in jubilee years and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labour members met for prayer at the church of san salvatore in campo where the devotion of the forty hours of exposition of the blessed sacrament was first introduced into rome  congregation of the oratoryedit in  neri received all the minor orders and was ordained deacon and finally priest on  may he thought of going to india as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in rome accordingly he settled down with some companions at the hospital of san girolamo della carità and while there tentatively began in  the institute with which his name is more especially connected that of the oratory the scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall the oratory at which there were prayers hymns and readings from scripture the church fathers and the martyrology followed by a lecture or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration the musical selections settings of scenes from sacred history were called oratorios giovanni palestrina was one of philip’s followers and composed music for the services the scheme was developed and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout rome notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening a completely new idea at that time he also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way neri sometimes led “excursions” to other churches often with music and a picnic on the way in  the florentines requested that neri leave san girolamo to oversee their newly built church in rome san giovanni dei fiorentini he was at first reluctant but by consent of pope pius iv he accepted while remaining in charge of san girolamo where the exercises of the oratory were kept up at this time the new society included among its members caesar baronius the ecclesiastical historian francesco maria tarugi afterwards archbishop of avignon and ottavio paravicini all three of whom were subsequently cardinals and also gallonius antonio gallonio author of a wellknown work on the sufferings of the martyrs ancina bordoni and other men of ability and distinction in  the florentines built a large oratory or missionroom for the society next to san giovanni in order to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from san girolamo and to provide a more convenient place of assembly and the headquarters were transferred there as the community grew and its mission work extended the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt and the offer of the small parish church of santa maria in vallicella conveniently situated in the middle of rome was made and accepted the building however not large enough for their purpose was pulled down and a splendid church erected on the site it was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that neri formally organized under permission of a papal bull dated  july  a community of secular priests called the congregation of the oratory the new church was consecrated early in  and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of san giovanni dei fiorentini neri himself did not leave san girolamo until  and then only by virtue of an injunction of the pope that he as the superior should reside at the chief house of his congregation he was at first elected for a term of three years as is usual in modern societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and without endeavouring for neri to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send out—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of gregory xv in  st philip neri and the virgin mary by tiepolo political activityedit although neri refrained from becoming involved in political matters he broke this rule in  when he persuaded pope clement viii to withdraw the excommunication and anathema laid on henry iv of france and the refusal to receive his ambassador even though the king had formally renounced calvinism neri saw that the popes attitude was more than likely to drive henry to a relapse and probably to rekindle the civil war in france and directed cardinal caesar baronius a member of the oratory who was then the popes confessor to refuse the pope absolution and to resign his office of confessor unless the pope would withdraw the anathema clement yielded at once though the whole college of cardinals had supported his policy and henry who did not learn the facts until several years afterwards testified lively gratitude for the timely and politic intervention neri continued in the government of the oratory until his death he was succeeded by baronius characteredit philip neri embodied a number of contradictions combining popular venerations with intensely individual piety he became embedded in the church hierarchy while seeking to reform a corrupt rome and an uninterested clergy he possessed a playful humour combined with a shrewd wit he considered a cheerful temper to be more christian than a melancholy one and carried this spirit into his whole life a joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one this was the secret of neris popularity and of his place in the folklore of the roman poor many miracles were attributed to him when his body was autopsied it was found that two of his ribs had been broken an event attributed to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year  benedict xiv who reorganised the rules for canonization decided that philips enlarged heart was caused by an aneurism ponnelle and bordet in their  biography st philip neri and the roman society of his times  conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural what is certain is that philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love practical commonplaceness says frederick william faber in his panegyric of neri was the special mark which distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day he looked like other men  he was emphatically a modern gentleman of scrupulous courtesy sportive gaiety acquainted with what was going on in the world taking a real interest in it giving and getting information very neatly dressed with a shrewd common sense always alive about him in a modern room with modern furniture plain it is true but with no marks of poverty about it—in a word with all the ease the gracefulness the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth considerable accomplishments and a very various information accordingly neri was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile jesuits who much desired to enlist him in their company did not rival and though an italian priest and head of a new religious order his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval frequent and popular preaching unconventional prayer and unsystematized albeit fervent private devotion neri prayed let me get through today and i shall not fear tomorrow neri had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his church being in truth an ardent ultramontane in doctrine as was all but inevitable in his time and circumstances and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life but that something more homely simple and everyday in character was needed for the new time death and venerationedit philip neris effigy at his tomb neri died around the end of the day on  may  the feast of corpus christi that year after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors about midnight he began hemorrhaging and baronius read the commendatory prayers over him baronius asked that he would bless his spiritual sons before dying and though he could no longer speak he blessed them with

societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and without endeavouring for neri to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send out—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of gregory xv in  st philip neri and the virgin mary by tiepolo political activityedit although neri refrained from becoming involved in political matters he broke this rule in  when he persuaded pope clement viii to withdraw the excommunication and anathema laid on henry iv of france and the refusal to receive his ambassador even though the king had formally renounced calvinism neri saw that the popes attitude was more than likely to drive henry to a relapse and probably to rekindle the civil war in france and directed cardinal caesar baronius a member of the oratory who was then the popes confessor to refuse the pope absolution and to resign his office of confessor unless the pope would withdraw the anathema clement yielded at once though the whole college of cardinals had supported his policy and henry who did not learn the facts until several years afterwards testified lively gratitude for the timely and politic intervention neri continued in the government of the oratory until his death he was succeeded by baronius characteredit philip neri embodied a number of contradictions combining popular venerations with intensely individual piety he became embedded in the church hierarchy while seeking to reform a corrupt rome and an uninterested clergy he possessed a playful humour combined with a shrewd wit he considered a cheerful temper to be more christian than a melancholy one and carried this spirit into his whole life a joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one this was the secret of neris popularity and of his place in the folklore of the roman poor many miracles were attributed to him when his body was autopsied it was found that two of his ribs had been broken an event attributed to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year  benedict xiv who reorganised the rules for canonization decided that philips enlarged heart was caused by an aneurism ponnelle and bordet in their  biography st philip neri and the roman society of his times  conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural what is certain is that philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love practical commonplaceness says frederick william faber in his panegyric of neri was the special mark which distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day he looked like other men  he was emphatically a modern gentleman of scrupulous courtesy sportive gaiety acquainted with what was going on in the world taking a real interest in it giving and getting information very neatly dressed with a shrewd common sense always alive about him in a modern room with modern furniture plain it is true but with no marks of poverty about it—in a word with all the ease the gracefulness the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth considerable accomplishments and a very various information accordingly neri was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile jesuits who much desired to enlist him in their company did not rival and though an italian priest and head of a new religious order his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval frequent and popular preaching unconventional prayer and unsystematized albeit fervent private devotion neri prayed let me get through today and i shall not fear tomorrow neri had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his church being in truth an ardent ultramontane in doctrine as was all but inevitable in his time and circumstances and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life but that something more homely simple and everyday in character was needed for the new time death and venerationedit philip neris effigy at his tomb neri died around the end of the day on  may  the feast of corpus christi that year after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors about midnight he began hemorrhaging and baronius read the commendatory prayers over him baronius asked that he would bless his spiritual sons before dying and though he could no longer speak he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died neri was beatified by paul v in  and canonized by pope gregory xv in  his memorial is celebrated on  may his body is in the chiesa nuova new church in rome neri is one of the influential figures of the counterreformation mainly for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the church itself oratoryedit philip neri as painted by guercino in  main article oratory of saint philip neri the congregation neri founded is of the least conventional nature rather resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type and its rules never written by neri but approved by pope paul v in   would have appeared incredibly lax in fact its religious character would seem almost doubtful to men such as bruno stephen harding francis of assisi or saint dominic it admits only priests aged at least  or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination supported by lay brothers the members live in community and each pays his own expenses having the usufruct of his private means—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty they have indeed a common table but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess by monthly payments from each member nothing is provided by the society except the bare lodging and the fees of a visiting physician everything else—clothing books furniture medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member there are no vows and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw when he pleases and to take his property with him the government strikingly unlike the jesuit autocracy is of a republican form and the superior though first in honour has to take his turn in discharging all the duties which come to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority including that of waiting at table which is not entrusted in the oratory to lay brothers according to the practice in most other communities four deputies assist the superior in the government and all public acts are decided by a majority of votes of the whole congregation in which the superior has no casting voice to be chosen superior  years of membership are requisite as a qualification and the office is tenable as all the others for but  years at a time no one can vote until he has been three years in the society the deliberative voice is not obtained before the eleventh year statue of philip neri in congregados church braga portugal there are thus three classes of members novices triennials and decennials each house can call its superior to account can depose and can restore him without appeal to any external authority although the bishop of the diocese in which any house of the oratory is established is its ordinary and immediate superior though without power to interfere with the rule their churches are nonparochial and they can perform such rites as baptisms marriages etc only by permission of the parish priest who is entitled to receive all fees due in respect of these ministrations the oratory chiefly spread in italy and in france where in  there were  houses all under the government of a superiorgeneral nicolas malebranche louis thomassin jules mascaron and jean baptiste massillon were members of the famous branch established in paris in  by bérulle later cardinal which had a great success and a distinguished history it fell in the crash of the french revolution but was revived by père pététot curé of st roch in  as the oratory of jesus and the immaculate mary the church of the oratory near the louvre belongs to the reformed church neri encouraged the singing of the lauda spirituale laude in his oratory services the prominent composers tomás luis de victoria and giovanni pierluigi da palestrina probably participated in this music his unique and varied aesthetic experience has been highlighted in a study by the italian

oratory  in popular culture  see also  references  sources  biographies  external links early lifeedit he was the son of francesco di neri a lawyer and his wife lucrezia da mosciano whose family were nobility in the service of the italian state he was carefully brought up and received his early teaching from the friars at san marco the famous dominican monastery in florence he was accustomed in later life to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them zenobio de medici and servanzio mini at the age of  philip was sent to his uncle romolo a wealthy merchant at san germano a neapolitan town near the base of monte cassino to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit his uncles fortune he gained romolos confidence and affection but soon after coming to san germano philip had a religious conversion he no longer cared for things of the world and chose to relocate to rome in  founding of the oratoryedit missions workedit after arriving in rome neri became a tutor in the house of a florentine aristocrat named galeotto caccia after two years he began to pursue his own studies for a period of three years under the guidance of the augustinians following this he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which in later life gained him the title of apostle of rome he also ministered to the prostitutes of the city in  he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous traveling throughout the city seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them for seventeen years philip lived as a layman in rome probably without thinking of becoming a priest around  he made the acquaintance of ignatius of loyola many of neris disciples found their vocations in the infant society of jesus philip neri confraternity of the holy trinityedit in  together with his confessor persiano rossa neri founded the confraternity of the most holy trinity of pilgrims and convalescents italian santissima trinita de pellegrini e de convalescenti whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to rome especially in jubilee years and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labour members met for prayer at the church of san salvatore in campo where the devotion of the forty hours of exposition of the blessed sacrament was first introduced into rome  congregation of the oratoryedit in  neri received all the minor orders and was ordained deacon and finally priest on  may he thought of going to india as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in rome accordingly he settled down with some companions at the hospital of san girolamo della carità and while there tentatively began in  the institute with which his name is more especially connected that of the oratory the scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall the oratory at which there were prayers hymns and readings from scripture the church fathers and the martyrology followed by a lecture or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration the musical selections settings of scenes from sacred history were called oratorios giovanni palestrina was one of philip’s followers and composed music for the services the scheme was developed and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout rome notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening a completely new idea at that time he also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way neri sometimes led “excursions” to other churches often with music and a picnic on the way in  the florentines requested that neri leave san girolamo to oversee their newly built church in rome san giovanni dei fiorentini he was at first reluctant but by consent of pope pius iv he accepted while remaining in charge of san girolamo where the exercises of the oratory were kept up at this time the new society included among its members caesar baronius the ecclesiastical historian francesco maria tarugi afterwards archbishop of avignon and ottavio paravicini all three of whom were subsequently cardinals and also gallonius antonio gallonio author of a wellknown work on the sufferings of the martyrs ancina bordoni and other men of ability and distinction in  the florentines built a large oratory or missionroom for the society next to san giovanni in order to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from san girolamo and to provide a more convenient place of assembly and the headquarters were transferred there as the community grew and its mission work extended the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt and the offer of the small parish church of santa maria in vallicella conveniently situated in the middle of rome was made and accepted the building however not large enough for their purpose was pulled down and a splendid church erected on the site it was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that neri formally organized under permission of a papal bull dated  july  a community of secular priests called the congregation of the oratory the new church was consecrated early in  and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of san giovanni dei fiorentini neri himself did not leave san girolamo until  and then only by virtue of an injunction of the pope that he as the superior should reside at the chief house of his congregation he was at first elected for a term of three years as is usual in modern societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and

a lawyer and his wife lucrezia da mosciano whose family were nobility in the service of the italian state he was carefully brought up and received his early teaching from the friars at san marco the famous dominican monastery in florence he was accustomed in later life to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them zenobio de medici and servanzio mini at the age of  philip was sent to his uncle romolo a wealthy merchant at san germano a neapolitan town near the base of monte cassino to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit his uncles fortune he gained romolos confidence and affection but soon after coming to san germano philip had a religious conversion he no longer cared for things of the world and chose to relocate to rome in  founding of the oratoryedit missions workedit after arriving in rome neri became a tutor in the house of a florentine aristocrat named galeotto caccia after two years he began to pursue his own studies for a period of three years under the guidance of the augustinians following this he began those labours amongst the sick and poor which in later life gained him the title of apostle of rome he also ministered to the prostitutes of the city in  he entered into the home mission work for which he became famous traveling throughout the city seeking opportunities of entering into conversation with people and of leading them to consider the topics he set before them for seventeen years philip lived as a layman in rome probably without thinking of becoming a priest around  he made the acquaintance of ignatius of loyola many of neris disciples found their vocations in the infant society of jesus philip neri confraternity of the holy trinityedit in  together with his confessor persiano rossa neri founded the confraternity of the most holy trinity of pilgrims and convalescents italian santissima trinita de pellegrini e de convalescenti whose primary object was to minister to the needs of the thousands of poor pilgrims who flocked to rome especially in jubilee years and also to relieve the patients discharged from hospitals but who were still too weak for labour members met for prayer at the church of san salvatore in campo where the devotion of the forty hours of exposition of the blessed sacrament was first introduced into rome  congregation of the oratoryedit in  neri received all the minor orders and was ordained deacon and finally priest on  may he thought of going to india as a missionary but was dissuaded by his friends who saw that there was abundant work to be done in rome accordingly he settled down with some companions at the hospital of san girolamo della carità and while there tentatively began in  the institute with which his name is more especially connected that of the oratory the scheme at first was no more than a series of evening meetings in a hall the oratory at which there were prayers hymns and readings from scripture the church fathers and the martyrology followed by a lecture or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration the musical selections settings of scenes from sacred history were called oratorios giovanni palestrina was one of philip’s followers and composed music for the services the scheme was developed and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout rome notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening a completely new idea at that time he also spent much of his time hearing confessions and effected many conversions in this way neri sometimes led “excursions” to other churches often with music and a picnic on the way in  the florentines requested that neri leave san girolamo to oversee their newly built church in rome san giovanni dei fiorentini he was at first reluctant but by consent of pope pius iv he accepted while remaining in charge of san girolamo where the exercises of the oratory were kept up at this time the new society included among its members caesar baronius the ecclesiastical historian francesco maria tarugi afterwards archbishop of avignon and ottavio paravicini all three of whom were subsequently cardinals and also gallonius antonio gallonio author of a wellknown work on the sufferings of the martyrs ancina bordoni and other men of ability and distinction in  the florentines built a large oratory or missionroom for the society next to san giovanni in order to save them the fatigue of the daily journey to and from san girolamo and to provide a more convenient place of assembly and the headquarters were transferred there as the community grew and its mission work extended the need for a church entirely its own made itself felt and the offer of the small parish church of santa maria in vallicella conveniently situated in the middle of rome was made and accepted the building however not large enough for their purpose was pulled down and a splendid church erected on the site it was immediately after taking possession of their new quarters that neri formally organized under permission of a papal bull dated  july  a community of secular priests called the congregation of the oratory the new church was consecrated early in  and the clergy of the new society at once resigned the charge of san giovanni dei fiorentini neri himself did not leave san girolamo until  and then only by virtue of an injunction of the pope that he as the superior should reside at the chief house of his congregation he was at first elected for a term of three years as is usual in modern societies but in  was nominated superior for life he was however entirely free from personal ambition and had no desire to be superior general over a number of dependent houses so he desired that all congregations formed on his model outside rome should be autonomous governing themselves and without endeavouring for neri to retain control over any new colonies they might themselves send out—a regulation afterwards formally confirmed by a brief of gregory xv in  st philip neri and the virgin mary by tiepolo political activityedit although neri refrained from becoming involved in political matters he broke this rule in  when he persuaded pope clement viii to withdraw the excommunication and anathema laid on henry iv of france and the refusal to receive his ambassador even though the king had formally renounced calvinism neri saw that the popes attitude was more than likely to drive henry to a relapse and probably to rekindle the civil war in france and directed cardinal caesar baronius a member of the oratory who was then the popes confessor to refuse the pope absolution and to resign his office of confessor unless the pope would withdraw the anathema clement yielded at once though the whole college of cardinals had supported his policy and henry who did not learn the facts until several years afterwards testified lively gratitude for the timely and politic intervention neri continued in the government of the oratory until his death he was succeeded by baronius characteredit philip neri embodied a number of contradictions combining popular venerations with intensely individual piety he became embedded in the church hierarchy while seeking to reform a corrupt rome and an uninterested clergy he possessed a playful humour combined with a shrewd wit he considered a cheerful temper to be more christian than a melancholy one and carried this spirit into his whole life a joyful heart is more easily made perfect than a downcast one this was the secret of neris popularity and of his place in the folklore of the roman poor many miracles were attributed to him when his body was autopsied it was found that two of his ribs had been broken an event attributed to the expansion of his heart while fervently praying in the catacombs about the year  benedict xiv who reorganised the rules for canonization decided that philips enlarged heart was caused by an aneurism ponnelle and bordet in their  biography st philip neri and the roman society of his times  conclude that it was partly natural and partly supernatural what is certain is that philip himself and his penitents associated it with divine love practical commonplaceness says frederick william faber in his panegyric of neri was the special mark which distinguishes his form of ascetic piety from the types accredited before his day he looked like other men  he was emphatically a modern gentleman of scrupulous courtesy sportive gaiety acquainted with what was going on in the world taking a real interest in it giving and getting information very neatly dressed with a shrewd common sense always alive about him in a modern room with modern furniture plain it is true but with no marks of poverty about it—in a word with all the ease the gracefulness the polish of a modern gentleman of good birth considerable accomplishments and a very various information accordingly neri was ready to meet the needs of his day to an extent and in a manner which even the versatile jesuits who much desired to enlist him in their company did not rival and though an italian priest and head of a new religious order his genius was entirely unmonastic and unmedieval frequent and popular preaching unconventional prayer and unsystematized albeit fervent private devotion neri prayed let me get through today and i shall not fear tomorrow neri had no difficulties in respect of the teaching of his church being in truth an ardent ultramontane in doctrine as was all but inevitable in his time and circumstances and his great merit was the instinctive tact which showed him that the system of monasticism could never be the leaven of secular life but that something more homely simple and everyday in character was needed for the new time death and venerationedit philip neris effigy at his tomb neri died around the end of the day on  may  the feast of corpus christi that year after having spent the day hearing confessions and receiving visitors about midnight he began hemorrhaging and baronius read the commendatory prayers over him baronius asked that he would bless his spiritual sons before dying and though he could no longer speak he blessed them with the sign of the cross and died neri was beatified by paul v in  and canonized by pope gregory xv in  his memorial is celebrated on  may his body is in the chiesa nuova new church in rome neri is one of the influential figures of the counterreformation mainly for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the church itself oratoryedit philip neri as painted by guercino in  main article oratory of saint philip neri the congregation neri founded is of the least conventional nature rather resembling a residential clerical club than a monastery of the older type and its rules never written by neri but approved by pope paul v in   would have appeared incredibly lax in fact its religious character would seem almost doubtful to men such as bruno stephen harding francis of assisi or saint dominic it admits only priests aged at least  or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination supported by lay brothers the members live in community and each pays his own expenses having the usufruct of his private means—a startling innovation on the monastic vow of poverty they have indeed a common table but it is kept up precisely as a regimental mess by monthly payments from each member nothing is provided by the society except the bare lodging and the fees of a visiting physician everything else—clothing books furniture medicines—must be defrayed at the private charges of each member there are no vows and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw when he pleases and to take his property with him the government strikingly unlike the jesuit autocracy is of a republican form and the superior though first in honour has to take his turn in discharging all the duties which come to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority including that of waiting at table which is not entrusted in the oratory to lay brothers according to the practice in most other communities four deputies assist the superior in the government and all public acts are decided by a majority of votes of the whole congregation in which the superior has no casting voice to be chosen superior  years of membership are requisite as a qualification and the office is tenable as all the others for but  years at a time no one can vote until he has been three years in the society the deliberative voice is not obtained before the eleventh year statue of philip neri in congregados church braga portugal there are thus three classes of members novices triennials and decennials each house can call its superior to account can depose and can restore him without appeal to any external authority although the bishop of the diocese in which any house of the oratory is established is its ordinary and immediate superior though without power to interfere with the rule their churches are nonparochial and they can perform such rites as baptisms marriages etc only by permission of the parish priest who is entitled to receive all fees due in respect of these ministrations the oratory chiefly spread in italy and in france where in  there were  houses all under the government of a superiorgeneral nicolas malebranche louis thomassin jules mascaron and jean baptiste massillon were members of the famous branch established in paris in  by bérulle later cardinal which had a great success and a distinguished history it fell in the crash of the french revolution but was revived by père pététot curé of st roch in  as the oratory of jesus and the immaculate mary the church of the oratory near the louvre belongs to the reformed church neri encouraged the singing of the lauda spirituale laude in his oratory services the prominent composers tomás luis de victoria and giovanni pierluigi da palestrina probably participated in this music his unique and varied aesthetic experience has been highlighted in a study by the italian

qui nella nostra città si è avvezzi alla noncuranza delle cose che hanno fatto i corsi della vita non ho visto mai nessuno e quasi nessuno ne parla nel ricordo che merita si tratta per appunto di san filippo neri al secolo filippo romolo neri nato a firenze il  di luglio del battezzato nella piccola chiesa di san pier grottino è morto a roma il giorno  di maggio di famiglia benestanteinfatti il padre svolgeva l’attività di notaio filippo da piccolissimo perse la mamma filippo cominciò a frequentare il convento di san marco evangelista a firenze sotto la direzione del frate domenicano girolamo savonarola durante gli studi presso il conventoil giovane neri si appassionò a due testi che avrebbero rafforzato il suo successivo apostolatoquesti sono le laudi di jacopone da todi che in seguito fece musicare amava tanto la spensieratezza gioviale ma accompagnata da una grande consapevolezza per l’umanità un’altra opera fu di un certo sacerdote fiorentinoil libro si intitolava “faceria del pievano arlottouna scrittura già per l’epoca molto sarcastica“ tra le sue motivazioni quotidiane è presente la figura dell’autobiografia di santa camilla da varano per i suoi pensieri neri la riteneva una vera maestra infatti la copia dell’opera è conservata ancora oggi nella biblioteca vallicellianacon su note scritte autografate quando arrivò a roma viveva come un eremita fra le strade della città dormendo sotto i portici delle chiese filippo è considerato senza ombra di dubbio “il santo della gioia” o se si vuole addirittura nel senso serafico buffone di dio in quegli anni in cui neri viveva a roma c’era un altro santo nella zona romana si chiamava “felice da cantalice” frate cappuccinodi carattere buono ma sempre accompagnato dal suo grande sarcasmo dopo grandi e innumerevoli sforzi disumani filippo assieme a “persico rosa” riuscì a mettere in piedi una struttura di enorme speranza questi era un “oratorio”il suo sogno di sempre questo oratorio raccoglieva tutti i bambini abbandonati e disadattati e senza nessuna dimoravivevano all’ombra di una vita marcia al confine dell’ultima emarginazione il neri amava tanto trascorrere le ore ad osservare il passeggio romano dalla terrazza della sua stanzetta prima della sua mortefu visitato dal suo caro amico di anni addietro san carlo borromeo qualche giorno dopo a causa di una forte emorragia morì con lo sguardo in altoe un sano sorriso sulla bocca come se fosse vivo gli stormi del nostro cielo manfredoniano oggi gli fanno bizze con i loro folti voli di festa per aver espresso il suo nome
