justices constituting the court en banc steele chief justice a delaware corporation appeals from the vice chancellors finding that it breached a contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith and is liable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel we reaffirm that where parties agree to negotiate in good faith in accordance with a term sheet that obligation to negotiate in good faith is enforceable where a trial judge makes a factual finding supported by the record that the parties would have reached an agreement but for the defendants bad faith negotiation we hold that a trial judge may award expectation damages we reverse the vice chancellors promissory estoppel holding because a promise expressed in a fully enforceable contract cannot give rise to a promissory estoppel claim we also reverse the vice chancellors equitable damages award based on his factual conclusion that the parties would have reached an agreement so that he may reconsider the award in light of this opinion i factual and procedural history a facts plaintiffappellee pharmathene inc and defendantappellant siga technologies inc are both delaware corporations engaged in biodefense research and development in  siga acquired an antiviral drug for the treatment of smallpox st at that time the drugs viability potential uses safety and efficacy were all unknown but the drug had enormous potential by late  siga had experienced difficulty developing the drug and was running out of money nasdaq threatened to delist sigas shares and sigas largest shareholder macandrews  forbes maf was unwilling to invest additional money siga estimated it needed approximately  million to complete the development process as a result of sigas difficulties sigas management began discussing a possible collaboration with pharmathene thomas konatich sigas chief financial officer contacted eric richman pharmathenes vice president of business development and strategies richman desired a merger between the two companies but siga resisted because of its past experience with pharmathene according to richmans contemporaneous notes siga insisted on framing a license agreement before discussing a merger because of that past experience and because siga needed an immediate cash infusion to stabilize its financial situation by the end of  both sigas and pharmathenes conservative estimates valued st at approximately  billion in late  and early  konatich and richman outlined the terms of a license agreement konatich kept donald drapkin chairman of sigas board of directors and mafs vice chairman well informed about the negotiations konatich and richman also assembled negotiation teams on behalf of their companies on january   richman sent konatich and dr dennis hruby sigas chief scientific officer a proposed term sheet based on his discussions with siga about a license agreement for st on january  hruby replied thanks for the prompt response we are most interested in trying to make this a mutually agreeable term sheet and moving on to the next step konatich and richman continued to exchange draft term sheets much of the negotiation focused on upfront cash payments and funding guarantees on january  richman sent konatich a revised term sheet that provided for a total deal size of  million an increased upfront payment of  million and significant cash milestone payments when konatich forwarded this term sheet to drapkin he recommended that drapkin speak directly to richman to present sigas board of directors position on pharmathenes proposal on january  the vice chancellor found that drapkin and richman discussed the term sheet during a telephone call and drapkin requested that richman make two changes richman testified that drapkin told him that if the changes were acceptable to pharmathene then we have got a deal on the term sheet and its ready to present to your board for approval at a january  pharmathene board meeting richman presented the january  term sheet and explained drapkins proposed changes jeffrey baumel pharmathenes outside counsel drafted the minutes for that board meeting the term sheet was not signed however and the minutes do not state that the board approved the term sheet on january  richman again spoke with drapkin and told him that the pharmathene board had approved the license agreement term sheet with drapkins two proposed changes while pharmathene alleges that by this time the parties had a deal and could move on to discussing a merger richman did not send a copy of the revised term sheet to drapkin until february   on january  a clean copy was made of the twopage license agreement term sheet incorporating drapkins two changes the lats the lats recites that the parties intended to establish a partnership to further develop  commercialize st for the treatment of smallpox and orthopox related infections and to develop other orthopox virus therapeutics the lats also sets forth terms relating to among other things patents covered licenses license fees and royalties however the lats was not signed and a footer on both pages states non binding terms the vice chancellor summarized the lats in his posttrial opinion without attempting to cover all the details the lats contemplates a license agreement along the following lines to support the further development and commercialization of st for the treatment of smallpox first siga would grant to pharmathene a worldwide exclusive license and sic under the patents knowhow and materials to use develop make have made sell export and import products in field the right to grant sublicenses shall be specifically included in the license second the license would cover st and all other related products worldwide covered by the patents and knowhow relating to st and its development and manufacture third the lats described the makeup of a research and development committee which would include representatives from both pharmathene and siga the parties identified twelve categories of tasks relevant to that committee and assigned responsibility for each one to either siga or pharmathene in addition pharmathene agreed to fund the research and development based on a defined budget fourth the lats included economic terms pharmathene was scheduled to pay a license fee of  million in total which consisted of  million cash upfront  million as a deferred license fee to be paid twelve months after execution of a license agreement if certain events occurred and  million after siga obtained financing in excess of  million in addition the lats contained a provision under which pharmathene would pay an additional  million based on the achievement of specific milestones relating to certain sales targets and regulatory approvals the lats also provided for pharmathene to make annual royalty payments of  on yearly net sales of patented products of less than  million  on sales greater than  million and  on sales greater than  billion lastly the lats stated that in addition siga will be entitled to receive  of any amounts by which net margin exceeds  on sales to the us federal government on january   the pharmathene board decided that it preferred a merger with siga instead of a license agreement so representatives of pharmathene and siga met to begin merger discussions on january  at mafs office in new york city because of sigas precarious financial position siga asked pharmathene to provide bridge financing so that siga could continue developing st while merger negotiations proceeded richman and two other pharmathene representatives testified that pharmathene agreed to consider raising funds for a bridge loan on the condition that pharmathene would obtain at least a license for st if merger negotiations fell through on february   david wright pharmathenes chief financial officer sent drapkin a draft merger term sheet that included the following provision regarding a license agreement siga and pharmathene will negotiate the terms of a definitive license agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in the term sheet    attached on schedule  hereto the license agreement will be executed simultaneously with the definitive merger agreement and will become effective only upon the termination of the definitive merger agreement drapkin testified that he thought pharmathene was confused and had no interest in a license agreement but the vice chancellor found drapkin undermined that testimony when he admitted that he understood that pharmathene wanted to negotiate two documents at once when he received the draft merger term sheet with the license agreement attached on february   the parties once again met at mafs office drapkin and another siga board member attended baumel reiterated pharmathenes desire to execute simultaneously a merger agreement and a license agreement in case the merger did not close relying on testimony from baumel richman and wright the vice chancellor found that drapkin told pharmathene he was not going to pay lawyers to draft a formal license agreement and suggested pharmathene just attach the lats to the merger agreement relying on baumels testimony the vice chancellor found that drapkin told pharmathene that this approach would be as good as a license agreement and would guarantee pharmathene at a minimum a license if negotiations for a merger fell through the pharmathene board reviewed a final merger term sheet on march   that term sheet specifically referred to the lats and included a copy of the lats as an exhibit again relying on testimony from baumel richman and wright the vice chancellor found that during a march  meeting drapkin reiterated that in any case if the merger doesnt close pharmathene will get its license on march  the parties signed a merger letter of intent and attached the merger term sheet and the lats on march   siga and pharmathene entered into a bridge loan agreement in which pharmathene loaned siga  million for expenses relating to the merger developing st and overhead the bridge loan agreement designates new york law as its governing law it also specifically contemplates that the parties might not ultimately agree on either a merger or a license agreement bridge loan agreement section  obligates the parties to negotiate in good faith a license agreement in accordance with the terms of the lats if the merger is terminated upon any termination of the merger term sheet    termination of the definitive agreement relating to the merger or if a definitive agreement is not executed    siga and pharmathene will negotiate in good faith with the intention of executing a definitive license agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in the license agreement term sheet attached as exhibit c and siga agrees for a period of  days during which the definitive license agreement is under negotiation it shall not directly or indirectly initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with any corporation partnership person or other entity or group concerning any competing transaction without the prior written consent of the other party or notice from the other party that it desires to terminate discussions hereunder with the bridge loan agreement signed pharmathene provided siga with financial and administrative support while the parties redevoted attention to their proposed merger terms on june   pharmathene and siga signed the merger agreement which selects delaware law as its choice of law merger agreement section  is substantively identical to bridge loan agreement section  and provides that if the merger is terminated the parties agree to negotiate in good faith a definitive license agreement in accordance with the latss terms section  stipulates that each of the parties must use their best efforts to take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the other parties hereto to carry out and consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement section  provides that those provisions among others survive the merger agreements termination the merger agreement had a dropdead date of september   the vice chancellor found that sigas key representatives understood that pharmathene and siga were likely to enter into a lasting relationship either by a merger or a license agreement several comments by siga representatives indicate that siga began experiencing sellers remorse after siga received a milliondollar grant from the national institutes of health as the parties continued preparing for the merger siga achieved several milestones for example sigas audit committee approved an agreement with a clinical trial organization to perform the first human trial of st in september  the national institutes of health awarded siga  million to develop the drug after receiving this grant siga representatives expressed remorse over having agreed to the merger as the merger agreements september  dropdead date approached the sec still had not approved sigas draft proxy statement pharmathene asked siga to extend the dropdead date on october  sigas board of directors met and decided to terminate the merger agreement shortly after terminating the merger agreement siga publicly announced it had received the  million nih grant and that st provided  protection against smallpox in a primate trial after that announcement siga sold two million shares of its stock at  per share more than three times sigas  share price after siga terminated the merger agreement pharmathene hired attorney elliot olstein to draft a licensing agreement with siga on october   baumel sent pharmathenes proposed license agreement to sigas outside counsel james grayer on october  olstein emailed nicholas coch another outside attorney for siga and stated that pharmathene was ready to sign the proposed license agreement because it contained all the essential terms of a license agreement and is completely consistent with the lats coch responded that siga would not provide a revised license agreement before the parties met because the nature of the negotiations required under the merger agreement necessitated a robust discussion meanwhile as the vice chancellor found siga had internally discussed alternative structures for a definitive license agreement sigas controller emailed konatich and several other siga representatives a financial analysis concluding that total past and future development costs equaled  million and that a  million upfront license fee would support a  profit split on november  the parties met to discuss the license agreement given the clinical progress made since the parties last negotiated pharmathene emphasized the need to revise some of the latss economic terms pharmathenes representatives expressed confusion about sigas new emphasis on a partnership and maintained that the latss terms bound the parties nevertheless pharmathene was willing to listen to sigas proposal in order to avoid a dispute siga then proposed a  million upfront payment and a  profit split siga agreed to draft a formal proposal and send it to pharmathene on november   siga sent pharmathene a page draft llc agreement the vice chancellor contrasted the lats to the draft llc agreement thusly the draft llc agreement included the following economic changes  the upfront payment from pharmathene to siga increased from  million to  million  the milestone payments to siga increased from  million to  million  the royalty percentages owed to siga increased from   and  depending on the amount of sales to    and  and  siga would receive  of any remaining profit whereas the lats provided for profit sharing only from us government sales having a margin of  or more in addition several noneconomic terms were revised to favor siga heavily and to undermine pharmathenes control of st these provisions included  sigas right to resolve disputes unilaterally  sigas ability to block any distribution to pharmathene  pharmathenes obligation to fund fully the llcs costs despite having to split profits  and  sigas right to terminate the llc under certain conditions with pharmathene having no right to cure and with all rights to the product reverting to siga olstein and coch exchanged letters discussing sigas draft llc agreement throughout november and december olstein asserted that the agreements terms were radically different from the terms set forth in the lats but that pharmathene was willing to consider changes to the lats including a  profit split siga disputed that the lats was binding because of the non binding terms footer and it never addressed pharmathenes proposed profit split coch issued an ultimatum on december  unless pharmathene responded by december  that it was prepared to negotiate without preconditions regarding the latss binding nature the parties had nothing more to talk about on december   pharmathene filed suit in the court of chancery b procedural history pharmathenes complaint contained seven separate counts asserting claims of breach of contract promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment on january   siga moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted after considering the parties briefing and argument the vice chancellor denied sigas motion on january   in pharmathene i after extensive discovery the vice chancellor granted pharmathenes motion to amend its complaint on may   and pharmathene filed its amended complaint on may   on may   siga filed an answer and counterclaim the counterclaim alleged that pharmathene breached its contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith and sought dismissal of the amended complaint as well as reliance damages and sigas attorneys fees and costs on march   siga moved for partial summary judgment under court of chancery rule c seeking to dismiss counts one through four of the amended complaint and to preclude pharmathene from obtaining either specific performance or expectation damages the parties briefed that motion and the vice chancellor heard argument on july   in pharmathene ii the vice chancellor denied sigas motion in its entirety in january  the vice chancellor presided over an elevenday trial in this action after extensive posttrial briefing counsel presented their final arguments on april   in pharmathene iii the vice chancellor made posttrial findings of fact and conclusions of law on both pharmathenes amended complaint and sigas counterclaim the vice chancellor determined that  delaware law applied  siga was liable for breach of its obligation under the bridge loan and merger agreements to negotiate in good faith a definitive license agreement in accordance with the latss terms  siga was also liable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel and  the proper remedy was an equitable payment stream approximating the terms of the license agreement to which he found the parties would ultimately have agreed the vice chancellor also awarded attorneys fees and costs relying on statutory authority and contractual provisions in the bridge loan agreement as well as the bad faith exception to the american rule in pharmathene iv the vice chancellor denied sigas motion for reargument in pharmathene v the vice chancellor issued a letter opinion accompanying his final order and judgment in pharmathene vi siga appeals the vice chancellors orders and pharmathene crossappeals ii standard of review different standards of review apply to different portions of this appeal we review de novo the vice chancellors conclusion that delaware law applies in this action the vice chancellors conclusions concerning whether a contractual provision requiring parties to negotiate in good faith is enforceable and whether siga is liable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel are legal questions that we review de novo we will uphold his factual conclusions supporting his legal findings as long as they are not clearly erroneous concerning the remedy the vice chancellor imposed whether or not an equitable remedy exists or is applied using the correct standards is an issue of law and reviewed de novo but determinations of fact and application of those facts to the correct legal standards    are reviewed for an abuse of discretion we review the vice chancellors interpretation of a contractual feeshifting provision de novo but we review his decision to award attorneys fees and costs for an abuse of discretion iii analysis a delaware law applies siga appeals the vice chancellors ruling in pharmathene i that delaware law applies to all of the claims in this dispute delaware courts analyzing contractual claims apply the most significant relationship test of restatement second of conflicts §  in cases where the parties do not specify a choice of law where the parties do specify a choiceoflaw section  allows the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern contractual rights and duties unless the chosen state lacks a substantial relationship to the parties or transaction or applying the law of the chosen state will offend a fundamental policy of a state with a material greater interest here we have two contracts the bridge loan agreement and the merger agreement which contain competing choiceoflaw clauses both impose an identical obligation to negotiate in good faith siga agrees that consistent with section  when two contracts are alleged to have been breached and each contract has a governing law provision designating a different states law the court must determine which contract takes precedence siga argues that the bridge loan agreement should take precedence over the merger agreement a southern district of new york judge faced a similar question when having to construe two agreements signed on the same date and for the same purpose he ultimately read both contracts together to determine which governed the activity that lay at the heart of the case similarly the vice chancellor compared the bridge loan agreement and the merger agreement and concluded that the merger agreement takes precedence because it was the most recent agreement the parties signed and because the scope of the parties relationship the merger agreement envisioned was broader than the bridge loan agreement we also note that the merger agreements termination triggered the obligation to negotiate in good faith therefore it is logical that the merger agreements choice of law should control we affirm the vice chancellors holding because the merger agreement occurred later in time and encompassed the activity that lay at the heart of this case therefore we apply delaware law b siga breached its contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith siga argues that the vice chancellor erred when he concluded that siga breached an obligation to negotiate in good faith under the bridge loan and merger agreements siga argues it is inconsistent to hold that the lats is not a binding license agreement and at the same time conclude that sigas obligation to negotiate in good faith requires that siga only propose terms substantially similar to the lats we disagree in titan investment fund ii lp v freedom mortgage corp a superior court judge held that a letter agreement and term sheet created an enforceable obligation that the parties negotiate a credit facility agreement in good faith on appeal we held that the superior court judge correctly determined that the defendant breached its obligation arising from the term sheet and letter agreement to negotiate in good faith although some ambiguity existed concerning whether an obligation to negotiate in good faith was enforceable before titan investment we now reaffirm that an express contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith is binding on the contracting parties in vs  a communications partners lp v palmer broadcasting limited partnership a chancellor applying new york law considered whether a letter detailing a preliminary understanding reached in a negotiation to purchase certain television and radio stations created an obligation to negotiate in good faith interpreting new york law he concluded that obligations to negotiate are said to be invalid or unenforceable where material aspects of the contract remain open he concluded that under new york law an agreement to negotiate a contract in good faith may be enforced if all the material terms of the contract have been agreed to by the parties ultimately he concluded that while the letter created an express agreement to negotiate in good faith with respect to the details of a price adjustment the contracts inferred obligation to continue negotiations on points other than the price adjustment provision was unenforceable because the defendant had no legal duty to commit itself legally to terms it had earlier negotiated eg price but had expressly not bound itself to legally in gillenardo v connor broadcasting delaware co a superior court judge considered a letter of intent setting forth the potential purchase price and other financing and negotiating terms for a sale of two radio stations including an attached draft of the purchase agreement and related exhibits the superior court judge distinguished vs  a communications because there the letter of intent had no express provision regarding the duty to work diligently towards completion of a sale agreement nor did it have an express provision requiring good faith attempts to finalize the sale agreement he also noted that new york law    may not be consistent with delaware law regarding the intent of the parties to create good faith duties to negotiate under a letter of intent because in delaware the intention of the parties controls the creation of a goodfaith duty to negotiate under a letter of intent we similarly distinguish vs  a communications from this case rgc international investors ldc v greka energy corp is instructive in rgc international a vice chancellor addressed whether a defendant breached an obligation to negotiate a definitive agreement based on a term sheet the vice chancellor noted that the term sheet did not include language that the parties explicitly reserved the right not to be bound he concluded that at the very least after signing the term sheet neither party could in good faith insist on specific terms that directly contradicted a specific provision found in the term sheet similarly although applying new york law a southern district of new york judge concluded that where parties bind themselves to a concededly incomplete agreement in the sense that they accept a mutual commitment to negotiate together in good faith in an effort to reach final agreement within the scope that has been settled in the preliminary agreement a party to that agreement may demand that his counterparty negotiate the open terms in good faith toward a final contract incorporating the agreed terms while good faith differences in the negotiation of the open issues may prevent a reaching of final contract a counterparty cannot insist on conditions that do not conform to the preliminary agreement the express contractual language in the bridge loan and merger agreements obligated the parties to negotiate in good faith with the intention of executing a definitive license agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in the lats the question becomes whether the language in accordance with the terms set forth means that the parties had a duty as the vice chancellor found to negotiate toward a license agreement with economic terms substantially similar to the terms of the lats or at least not inconsistent with the latss terms or whether the parties intended the lats merely as a jumping off point although the lats itself is not signed and contains a footer on each page stating non binding terms the record supports the vice chancellors factual conclusion that incorporation of the lats into the bridge loan and merger agreements reflects an intent on the part of both parties to negotiate toward a license agreement with economic terms substantially similar to the terms of the lats if the merger was not consummated the vice chancellor recognized that while the economic terms siga proposed in the draft llc agreement may not have directly contradicted the lats    they differed dramatically from the lats in favor of siga to the extent that they virtually disregarded the economic terms of the lats other than using them as a skeletal framework for the types of payments that would be made without giving any meaningful weight to the dollar amounts or percentages siga had negotiated earlier siga notes that requiring parties to propose terms substantially similar to those in a term sheet introduces some uncertainty and litigation risk into negotiations because a trial judge must find both that a partys proposed terms are substantially dissimilar and that the party proposed those terms in bad faith we think siga overstates the litigation risk under delaware law bad faith is not simply bad judgment or negligence but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity it is different from the negative idea of negligence in that it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will not only did sigas negotiating position differ substantially from the latss terms but also the vice chancellor also correctly concluded that siga took that position in bad faith the record supports the vice chancellors finding that siga disregarded the latss terms and attempted to negotiate a definitive license agreement that contained economic and other terms drastically different and significantly more favorable to siga than those in the lats the vice chancellor also found that drapkin abdicated his responsibility to remind siga of the terms to which it agreed in the lats and resorted instead to a selective and biased memory of the parties negotiations drapkin apparently took no active role in the postseptember  licensing negotiations other than to offer his counterfactual recollection that the lats was nothing but a jumping off point the vice chancellor further found that drapkin and siga for that matter essentially left the negotiations of the license agreement to those who either had no involvement in the previous negotiations and agreements    or acting in their own selfinterest    were more than happy to disregard the economic importance of the lats evidence that siga began experiencing sellers remorse during the merger negotiations for having given up control of what was looking more and more like a multibillion dollar drug bolsters the vice chancellors finding that siga failed to negotiate in good faith for a definitive license agreement in accordance with the terms of the lats therefore we affirm the vice chancellors conclusion that siga acted in bad faith when negotiating the license agreement in breach of its contractual obligations under both the merger agreement and the bridge loan agreement c siga is not liable under a theory of promissory estoppel we reverse the vice chancellors conclusion that siga was liable on the basis of promissory estoppel a claim for promissory estoppel requires a plaintiff to show the following i a promise was made ii it was the reasonable expectation of the promisor to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee iii the promisee reasonably relied on the promise and took action to his detriment and iv such promise is binding because injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise the vice chancellor based his finding of liability arising from promissory estoppel on sigas promise to afford pharmathene a good faith opportunity to obtain control of st and not solely in exchange for interest on a secured loan promissory estoppel does not apply however where a fully integrated enforceable contract governs the promise at issue the promise to negotiate in good faith for a definitive license agreement in accordance with the latss terms is expressly included in both the bridge loan and merger agreements therefore a claim based on promissory estoppel cannot lie and a vice chancellor must look to the contract as the source of a remedy on the breach of an obligation to negotiate in good faith d proper remedy we now turn to the question of what is the proper contractual remedy for breach of an agreement to negotiate in good faith where the court finds as fact that the parties had they negotiated in good faith would have reached an agreement our decisions have not clearly answered this question in titan investment fund ii lp v freedom mortgage corp we reversed the superior court judges award of a onepercent commitment fee for breach of an agreement to negotiate in good faith we noted that it was fatally inconsistent for the trial judge to conclude that the contract would not have closed even absent freedoms breach and at the same time award damages that presupposed the opposite conclusion namely that the deal would have closed we concluded that given the plaintiffs inability to establish that the    contract would have closed but for the defendants breach the plaintiff was not entitled to damages measured on a benefitofthebargain basis rather the plaintiff was entitled only to its reliance damages measured by its actuallyincurred costs and expenses in rgc international investors ldc v greka energy corp although that vice chancellor confusingly awarded damages for both breach of an obligation to negotiate and promissory estoppel he concluded that he should award damages and security in the amount equal to what the plaintiff should have received under the term sheet he reasoned that the award was not speculative because the term sheet embodied how the parties themselves agreed to value the defendants obligations to the plaintiff even though our choice of law analysis mandates that we apply delaware law we find other courts analyses instructive federal courts interpreting new york law recognize two types of binding preliminary agreements type i and type ii parties create a type ii preliminary agreement when they agree on certain major terms but leave other terms open for further negotiation the parties can bind themselves to a concededly incomplete agreement in the sense that they accept a mutual commitment to negotiate together in good faith in an effort to reach final agreement within the scope that has been settled in the preliminary agreement a type ii agreement does not commit the parties to their ultimate contractual objective but rather to the obligation to negotiate the open issues in good faith in an attempt to reach the alternate objective within the agreed framework in goodstein construction corp v city of new york the new york court of appeals established that new york law limits a plaintiff to reliance damages for breach of an agreement to negotiate without distinguishing between type i and type ii agreements in fairbrook leasing inc v mesaba aviation inc the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit applying new york law considered the remedies available for breach of a type ii binding preliminary agreement the court recognized that new yorks intermediate appellate courts have    read goodstein    as categorically precluding expectation damages for breach of a type ii binding preliminary agreement to negotiate a final agreement in good faith the court nevertheless commented that it was not as confident   that goodstein    should be read as categorically precluding benefitofthebargain damages for all breaches of binding preliminary agreements to negotiate a final agreement in good faith the court citing conflicting majority and concurring opinions in venture associates corp v zenith data systems corp noted that it was a difficult largely unsettled question of remedies the eighth circuit then proceeded to analyze the question of whether goodstein would bar expectation damages for breach of a type ii agreement the eighth circuit noted that the goodstein court rejected expectation damages because there would be no way to measure them without knowing whether the parties would have reached an agreement the eighth circuit questioned whether goodstein would still apply if a judge could discern what agreement would have been reached ultimately the eighth circuit declined to award expectation damages because the term sheet was silent on significant issues and the missing terms could not be judicially determined by objective criteria in the term sheet itself or in commercial practice usage or custom similarly in venture associates the seventh circuit court of appeals addressed a binding agreement to negotiate in good faith toward the formation of a contract of sale under illinois law the majority noted that if the plaintiff can prove that    but for the defendants bad faith the parties would have made a final contract then the loss of the benefit of the contract is a consequence of the defendants bad faith and the defendant is liable for that loss if it is foreseeable in a concurring opinion judge cudahy noted his disagreement as a public policy matter with the majority on that point our decision in titan investments leaves open the question of whether expectation damages are available where the trial judge makes a factual finding that the parties would have reached agreement but for the defendants breach in fashioning his remedy the vice chancellor noted the lack of consensus we now hold that where the parties have a type ii preliminary agreement to negotiate in good faith and the trial judge makes a factual finding supported by the record that the parties would have reached an agreement but for the defendants bad faith negotiations the plaintiff is entitled to recover contract expectation damages in this case the vice chancellor made two key factual findings supported by the record  the parties memorialized the basic terms of a transaction in    the lats and expressly agreed in the bridge loan and merger agreements that they would negotiate in good faith a final transaction in accordance with those terms and  but for sigas bad faith negotiations the parties would have consummated a license agreement the vice chancellors factual conclusions support a finding that siga and pharmathene entered into a type ii preliminary agreement and that neither party could in good faith propose terms inconsistent with that agreement because we had not previously addressed whether delaware recognizes type ii preliminary agreements and permits a plaintiff to recover expectation damages and because it is unclear to what extent the vice chancellor based his damages award upon a promissory estoppel holding rather than upon a contractual theory of liability predicated on a type ii preliminary agreement we reverse the vice chancellors damages award and remand the case for reconsideration of the damages award consistent with this opinion e attorneys fees the vice chancellor awarded attorneys fees based on both the bridge loan agreements contractual feeshifting provisions and on the bad faith exception to the american rule he also awarded pharmathene a portion of its expert witness costs under  del c §  and court of chancery rule d under the american rule and delaware law litigants are normally responsible for paying their own litigation costs in contract litigation where the contract contains a feeshifting provision we will enforce that provision we affirm the vice chancellors conclusion that siga breached its contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith in both the bridge loan and merger agreements the bridge loan agreement contains two provisions that shift attorneys fees and expenses for a breach of that agreement we also affirm the vice chancellors conclusion based on the plain meaning of these provisions that siga is liable for pharmathenes reasonable fees and costs that arise out of sigas breach of bridge loan agreement section s obligation to negotiate in good faith accordingly we do not reach or address the vice chancellors alternative holding that pharmathene is entitled to attorneys fees based on the bad faith exception to the american rule delaware law dictates that in fee shifting cases a judge determine whether the fees requested are reasonable when considering his fee award the vice chancellor properly tailored the award to the bases for liability on which pharmathene prevailed however we reverse at least one basis on which the vice chancellor predicated the fee award the vice chancellor also tailored his award of expert witness fees to account for those portions of expert evidence he found unhelpful when determining the damage award on remand the vice chancellor shall redetermine his damage award in light of this opinion and is free to reevaluate the helpfulness of expert testimony therefore we reverse the award of attorneys fees and expenses so that the vice chancellor may determine on remand the proper award consistent with this opinion f pharmathenes crossappeal pharmathenes claims that it is entitled to  an alternative payment stream based on the latss terms  specific performance granting it a license in accordance with the latss terms because the lats is an enforceable contract or  recover damages under the doctrine of unjust enrichment all those claims are alternative contentions advanced in the event we do not affirm the vice chancellors judgment because we affirm the vice chancellors finding that siga is liable for breaching its contractual obligations to negotiate in good faith in accordance with the latss terms we do not reach these arguments pharmathene also contends that the vice chancellor erroneously failed to award pharmathene its lumpsum expectation damages on the basis that they would be too speculative we do not reach this claim either because we reverse the vice chancellors damages award and remand for him to reconsider it in light of this opinion iv conclusion for these reasons we affirm the court of chancerys judgment in part reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion  the facts in this section are taken primarily from the vice chancellors posttrial opinion below pharmathene inc v siga techs inc pharmathene iii  wl  del ch sept    siga also lacked much of the institutional

testified that the minutes do not mention the term sheet because he does not incorporate documents into the minutes until they are signed  when asked why richman explained that drapkin did not ask for
