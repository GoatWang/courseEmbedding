trust  the good bad and ugly news in q results  chesapeake granite wash trust nysechkr  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»chesapeake granite wash trust  the good bad and ugly news in q resultsmay  about chesapeake granite chkr daniel r moore portfolio strategy bonds oil  gas longterm horizonfinancialrelativitycomlast quarter for chesapeake granite wash trust nysechkr was interesting because it provided a range of areas that showed change mostly in a positive direction but it was still an ugly quarter so i will get that part of the report out of the way first on may  chkr announced its quarterly distribution for production during the time period december  through february  chkr is heavily weighted in production to natural gas so favorable trends in natural gas prices would lead one to expect a decent quarter for the trust given the low levels gas prices reached over the past year however chkrs distribution of  was  below target and was so poor that the earnings on a fully dilutive basis could not cover the subordination threshold for the trust on a fully diluted basis the distribution was  which was  below target  so the subordinated units of the trust all held by chesapeake received a distribution that was substantially lower the lower distribution level is not a surprise because it has become the new normal for the trust as the above graph shows the distribution levels have been below the ipo target for the past five quarters the rise since august  is not a function of better performance  it is only a function of the subordination threshold which is  of target on a fully diluted basis the past four quarter distributions have been the subordination threshold amount the trust press release references lower total sales volume and realized price levels as the cause for the miss the market share price leading up to the announcement was positive and there was no reaction to the announcement  which likely means that the actual results were not a surprise and there are other factors that are specific to the trust as well as general market trends that are currently positive for share demand the overall market rally to the extent it is caused by federal reserve policy is an impact that an investor will have to judge relative to their overall portfolio i personally believe it is distorting the pricing of risk since about mid last year and have written on the topic but at the moment this type of distortion is not likely to break if investors are waiting for it the best strategy at this stage is not to overpay for risk and hope for any individual holding in your portfolio the specific areas that i see affecting the expectations for future trust performance are what i will focus on in this article review of recent market impacting events in the article i published before the opening trade on march  chesapeake granite wash trust  updated reserves show major downward revision buyers beware i analyzed the trusts proven reserve revisions as announced in the published dec   k the day this article was published the information was not yet priced into the shares and the shares fell from over  to slightly below  in two trading days this over  gap down in share price provides a good indication of the market expectations of how big a negative impact the reserve revision would have on the future value of the trust since that time the shares traded sideways until midapril and then began a  retracement back to the level it was just before the information about the revision to trust reserves became public a part of this rally is correlated with the sp which is up  over the same period but the outperformance needs some additional explanation there are some positive signals regarding the initial revision the trust ceo announced on may  that by drilling only three wells per ami section instead of four well performance loss on wells yet to be drilled is possibly mitigated this means that at least on the remaining wells the issue may not be as bad as expected so maybe there is a rational for hope at least on the remaining undrilled wells and is in my assessment the likely reason shares have recovered since midapril so how do you evaluate all of these moving parts and assess the current share price this report will provide information to fairly assess the situation for yourself and provide my assessment of the value of the trust at this time chkr earnings performance analysis in the press release announcing the trust results management pointed to lower sales volume and realized prices than the estimate in the ipo target as the reason that the distribution target was missed this was not unexpected given the pv which showed a sharp decrease in mboe proven reserves of  during  due to well performance during the quarter volume was  mboe down  from a high of  mboe in the spring production period in  current quarter distribution is for prior quarter production and also  lower than the  mboe registered one year ago the earnings for the most recent quarter however did not track lower with production  which is a relative good sign my review of the results show that realized prices in general were positive for results any statements about realized prices are only indicating that the price level was not as good as it could have been primarily due to the continued low ngl price and the wide differential spread to oil but overall the earnings line is restrained largely by lower production which to the extent it is not caused by decisions to hold product off the market is a result of lower well performance which is not recoverable in the future drilling progress in the graphic below you can see that drilling has been accelerated by chesapeake nysechk ahead of the ipo schedule the trust drilling is expected to be completed by the end of  drilling completion in december  or early  means that subordination will likely end starting with the august distribution in  the ipo prospectus projected that the end of subordination could take as long as the june  quarter the biggest news with respect to drilling during the quarter was the remedy chesapeake is using to mitigate the well performance issue on future drilled wells with respect to the problem encountered with drilled wells that have gone into production and wells conveyed to the trust the statement about the well performance issue during the earnings call was as follows the changes to previous estimates were primarily as a result of higher than expected pressure depletion within certain areas of the granite wash ami to mitigate this issue we are evaluating the benefits of drilling only three wells per section rather than four wells preliminary results while early have been encouraging the trust has  of the total wells that chesapeake is responsible to drill still remaining to be drilled the undrilled wells represent  of the total wells the trust expects to have in production at the end of drilling q statement about the impairment here is an excerpt found in the accounting notes from the q published by the trust on may   impairment of royalty interest during the quarter ended march   the trust recognized a  million impairment of the royalty interest the impairment was the result of reserve revisions that were due to current results being below expectations primarily as a result of higher than expected pressure depletion within certain areas of the ami this has resulted in lower initial production rates and lower expected ultimate recovery in certain recent development wells a couple of analytical notes for investors the m writeoff in book value of the trust investment is lower than the pv downward adjustment on a relative basis the writeoff represents  of the m investment in the royalty interest made by the trust at ipo the dec   pv reduced the proven reserves by  mboe on a conveyance of  mboe or  netted to  if you add discoveries and extensions in  on a relative basis one would expect that the writeoff of the trust investment would need to be of similar magnitude however it appears the trust has only written off the degradation to proven reserves associated with the wells already in production  leaving a portion of the downgrade to be determined based on the mitigation plan results one thing is certain about  of the proven reserves invested in by the trust are considered nonrecoverable and contrary to accounting jargon about being noncash and not affecting distributions it is a noncash writeoff that you can expect will reduce cash distributions going forward the rest of the writeoff depends on the performance of the  remaining wells to be drilled the conflicting information in the q and pv needs to be resolved based on existing public information it is hard to know whether the mitigation plan is just to make sure the major reserve revision in the pv does not get worse or whether there can be some recovery from the initial estimate this question was not directly asked at the earnings call i am inclined to want some actual evidence of improvement before bidding up the shares based on the accounting entry however there is a probability the results wont be as bad going forward i will provide information about how this can and already has affected share value in the fair value section of this article production mix analysis the pv published in the most recent chkr k showed that the trust over the past year showed a slight decline in oil in its production mix relative to natural gas and ngl this product mix composition trend continued to be confirmed in the past quarter results the trend over time has had a small impact on the value of the trust as boe volume has trended to lower value products however the impact in the most recent quarter due to production mix was not a major contributing factor on earnings performance the biggest positive impact on the chkr trust earnings performance in the past quarter can be found in the market price for natural gas in the graph below you can see the actual market prices for oil gas and ngl during the past year and the last production period the average realized price at the trust was  in the november to february production quarter this is  higher than the  the prior quarter as the market prices reflect the big downward change in the realized price level at the trust occurred three quarters ago  when both oil and ngl prices suffered significant declines overall the improvement in realized price is primarily due to the increase in natural gas prices the trust oil production is estimated to be  hedged with derivative contracts that lock the realized price at  per barrel for oil the ngl price is hedged using oil to the extent swap contracts cover production volume at a ratio of approximately  to  this only hedges general energy market price declines and does nothing for swings in the underlying ngl product market as you can see from the graph ngl market prices have been in the dumps since last summer and remained low during the past production quarter the spread differential of  over the past several quarters has placed a strain on realized ngl prices when the impacts of the hedges are included the good news is that market data show that the spread is narrowing in the market presently and ngl prices are in the recent trade above  per mboe price does not reflect delivery differential for chkr i expect the trust will see a steady improvement above the  ngl realized price in the coming quarters there is also long run promise for the ngl market prices if more delivery infrastructure is completed and exports markets can be accessed the biggest risk i see currently for this path is political trust derivative position analysis the chesapeake granite wash trust has most if not all of its liquid production hedged presently through september   which coincides very closely with the estimated time frame that subordination protection to common unit holders will end the bad news about the derivative position is that it is currently a negative drag on the trust earnings potential as shown in the graph below based on the forward pricing curve the negative impact on trust earnings through is m or  per unit however the hedges do serve as a floor under which trust income from expected oil and ngl volume cannot fall below with the hedges in place the trust cannot realize higher or lower prices on oil and ngl production volume with the exception of any basis risk from actual underlying product delivery until q  in the case of oil delivery the basis risk for the trust appears to be nominal at present and the hedge has been effective however the widened spread between ngl market delivery prices and oil prices has made the derivative contract total ineffective for hedging ngl downward price moves the trust does not hedge natural gas prices and the general price improvement trend in the market has flowed through to the trusts earnings in recent quarters pv updated in the trusts k published in early march the year end pv was supplied which showed a per share value of  for the expected cash flows from the remaining proven reserves held by the trust discounted at  i have updated the pv for the production volume at the trust since the pv was completed the adjusted pv is  per unit share some details about the pv the composite average price level net of expenses to get this pv estimated value is  per boe at the price assumptions shown and a production mix of oil ngl natgas  this composite price is well below the current market average if the natural gas price averages  the realized composite average price in the pv improves by  the estimated adjusted pv would be  pv trust comps the current pvs of trusts that i track nyseper nysesdr nysesdt nyseect are shown in the table below and as you can see the chesapeake granite wash trust is trading at a price point that is x its adjusted pv x using the may   market price the chkr production mix is generally higher on average in natural gas mix and is trading in a range which is comparable to the sandridge mississippian trust ii currently the natural gas heavy trusts are trading at a much higher multiple to some extent it is warranted as i have shown in the calculation which adjusts the pv calculation for sdt based on expectations that pricing returns to a  per mcf pricing level product mix oilnglnatgas currently the market is not trading the oil portion of trust production at any significant premium to pv this is most evident in the per valuation and also shows up in the lower multiple at sdr the forward price curve for oil seems to be lowering the current market value of the oil heavy trusts trust fair value estimation in my previous valuation of chkr i used a discounted distribution model which adjusted the expected target distributions which were provided in the trust ipo prospectus the distribution adjustment factor that was utilized was  and was derived from a thorough analysis of the dec   pv in this report i have modified the model slightly to allow a more accurate fit of the going forward production to market expectations for energy prices as well as to model the expected drop off in distributions that could occur post an early end to subordination the table below summarizes the information used in the model to derive a go forward distribution forecast when combined with the expected depletion of remaining proven reserves held by the trust the model price assumptions are based on the forward price curve for oil and gas prices combined with the trust hedge contracts through september  and then post hedge use a market price base on futures price levels the out year price levels are grown at a rate of  annually up to a cap level which in this model are reached in  for oil but are not reached before trust termination for natural gas all prices are adjusted for delivery based on the average differential which is typically realized by the trust the model also uses a product mix as shown in the table which is a downward adjustment in oil mix from the ipo distribution model one additional variable was added to the production and distribution model for this article  the impact of potentially better well performance on the remaining wells to be drilled than the previous estimate there is no means of knowing this at this time i have only included it for sensitivity analysis reasons in addition to the base case revision the current model results shown below include the fair value estimates for both cases total proven reserves depleted over the remainder of the trust in the production curve shown above equals  mboe the base case model which i also review below assumes the current pv minus the latest production period equals  mboe based on these model assumption at the current unit closing price level of  on may   the implied rate of return on the trust if bought and held to termination is  in the base case pv scenario and  assuming the trusts efforts to mitigate the loss in well performance in remaining to be drilled wells produces a  recovery of proven production reserves previously estimated to be lost through time i choose the  recovery for a reason it is the point at which i estimate the drilling operator chesapeake will not be taking a loss in distributions below the subordination threshold on its subordination shares there is every incentive for chesapeake to at least spread out the drilling locations on the ami in order to improve the return on its own account for the next several years beyond this point however i am skeptical note the march  article at a  discount rate produced a  valuation using a  impact on proven reserves factor the new model uses the same level of reserves as adjusted in the pv but the underlying assumptions produce a  lower impact on distributions over time the new model aligns with the market traded range of  per unit post the pv reserve report publication in march as the model shows the fair value estimate at a  rate of return is  for the base case and improves to almost  if the drilling mitigation plan shows reasonable success the valuation is lower if a higher market return is used as the discount factor this valuation will adjust downward after the exdividend date on may  bottom line the chesapeake granite wash trust continues to show very poor results when compared to the plan sold to ipo shareholders that is the ugly inconvenient truth the good news in the quarter is that natural gas prices improved results there is a possibility the drag on earnings from ngl price levels will be reduced in coming quarters and there is a mitigation plan in place that will hopefully produce some positive impact on the performance of the remaining to be drilled wells all of this said there is currently very little prospect for the trust to recover to the point over the next several years in which it can actually exceed the subordination threshold level in distributions to common unit holders  short of some spectacular upward move in natural gas and ngl prices and a major upward revision in proven reserves all of these are unlikely events in my opinion in the intermediate term based on this review combined with a  baseline floor rate of return i suggest the fair value of the trust should be in the range of  or even below not  on a relative basis there are other trusts in the market that are trading at higher discounted rate of returns which i have evaluated using the same model and methodology i see nothing to warrant a premium in the pricing of the chesapeake trust to the other trusts at this time that however is an opinion i hope the facts provided in the
