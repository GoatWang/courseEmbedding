valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp good morning everyone ipg first quarter  revenue and eps were well above the high end of our guidance ranges driven by rapid growth across our core products applications and geographies first quarter orders came in at a record level and based on our current backlog we believe we are in excellent position to deliver another strong quarter in q as a reminder we are focused on three key initiatives for  enhancing our leadership position within our core materials processing markets expanding into new products and applications and generating industryleading profit and cash flow starting with our core markets we had our strongest q ever the pace at which our fiber lasers are replacing conventional lasers and nonlaserbased technologies is accelerating at the same time the competitive environment seems to have shifted more in ipgs favor as the competition is finding it increasingly difficult to match our power advantages global scale low cost and high quality and we continue to drive adoption with a goal of making fiber lasers the preferred tool of quality – sorry thats the preferred tool of choice across both typical laser and nonlaser materials processing applications over the last  to  months we have made considerable investments to enhance our product portfolio our sales staff and our service capabilities these investments we believe played a crucial role in our ability to execute this quarter helping us better identify opportunities and win business in our core markets sales of highpower lasers increased  yearoveryear due to rapid growth in cutting and welding our two largest applications total kilowatts of highpower lasers sold in the first quarter increased by more than  yearoveryear in revenue and about  in units in addition more than  of our highpower laser sales were at  kilowatts and above compared with  a year ago demand for  to  kilowatt lasers for cutting applications continues to gain significant momentum with ipgs reliable and costeffective lasers customers use the higher power kilowatt lasers to cut faster and develop new applications in fact some customers are planning to introduce cutting systems with  kilowatt lasers our results suggest that the higher productivity and lower operating cost of fiber lasers are accelerating the replacement of the installed base of co cutting systems i am pleased to report total welding sales driven by highpower and qcw lasers increased nearly  yearoveryear to a record level especially we found an enormous market demand growth for our qcw lasers where during first four months of the year we have shipped of about  units or more than during the full year  we believe this validates our thesis that laser welding has tremendous opportunities displacing existing lasers such as lamppumped ndyag and nonlaser technologies in joining applications demand within our core business was especially strong in china which despite being our largest geographic market grew  yearoveryear we are also continuing to expand into systems market where sales have increased yearoveryear thanks to strong growth in systems for macro materials processing in our seam stepper and other technologies which replace traditional spot welding technology outside our core materials processing market we grew sales in our telecom products by  driven both by our menara acquisition and solid organic growth advanced applications grew  thanks to strong uptake in fiber laser technology used for rd and defense applications we are also pleased to report the first sales of rgb lasers which are now being used in cinemas with our oem projection partner as tim will explain our first quarter was a very strong one from a profitability perspective highlighting the strong returns generated from our doubledigit revenue growth and industryleading margins earnings per diluted share of  increased  yearoveryear we are off to a fast start in  demonstrating our execution across our end markets our order flow remains strong although our visibility into the second half of the year particularly q remains somewhat limited at this time we continue to benefit from the secular growth of fiber lasers within materials processing and other applications our capabilities within these markets are currently unmatched while the competitive landscape appears to be shifting in our favor our vertical integration and process knowhow drive our technology and cost advantage which when combined with our manufacturing sales and service scale enables us to continue share gains in materials processing over time we expect these advantages to drive similar gains within micro materials processing applications and new industries like displays medical rd and defense with that i will turn the call over to tim timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp thank you valentin and good morning everyone before i begin my comments on the quarter i would like to make a few opening remarks first i would like to welcome jim hillier our new vice president of investor relations quite a few of you have met jim already and we believe he will be a valuable addition to the ipg team while angelo lopresti our general counsel and corporate secretary no longer needs to make the introductory comments on these earnings calls he remains actively engaged in our investor relations process and a valued member of the ipg senior leadership team i would also like to thank sharon merrill associates for  great years of ir advisory service to ipg finally i want to draw your attention to the financial data workbook posted to our investor relations website in conjunction with our earnings release the excelbased model contains ipg historic financial results and key metrics over the last  years we hope you find this to be a valuable resource as you update or build your financial models on ipg because much of the data we typically review in our prepared comments can be found in this model i will focus our prepared comments on the key highlights and significant changes during the period we believe this change in format will enable us to spend more time addressing your questions on our earnings calls turning to the results first quarter revenue grew  to a record  million materials processing sales increased  yearoveryear and accounted for approximately  of total sales during the quarter yearoveryear growth rates accelerated in applications for cutting and welding our two largest end markets while marking and engraving grew by a singledigit percentage yearoveryear notably fiber laser sales for welding applications were at a record level growing nearly  versus the year ago period sales to other markets were up  yearoveryear driven by strength in telecom and advanced applications menara generated  million revenue during the quarter china our largest geographic region from a revenue standpoint was also among our fastest growth areas up  yearoveryear we believe this is being driven by secular growth across several different industries multiple applications and a healthy consumer electronics investment cycle in addition chinabased machine tool customers are rapidly adopting our high power fiber lasers as the product of choice for their cutting systems due to the faster performance lower power consumption greater versatility and higher reliability of our solutions over conventional lasers and other competing products as valentin noted earlier we have invested considerable resources in china to enhance our sales coverage our service capabilities and our applications development work we believe these investments are enabling us to better identify opportunities build and expand customer relationships and enhance our overall execution in the first quarter we saw some results from our investments through new oem customer wins and displacing other fiber laser makers at other customers beyond china other areas of strength included career in russia where we are gaining sales in the cutting market in the us welding sales were particularly strong this quarter the result of considerable work done by our application engineers to demonstrate the power performance and flexibility of our solutions within advanced automotive welding applications in europe despite a subdued auto market we saw strong growth driven by high power laser sales into cutting applications sales in japan were down double digits due to seasonal softness and expected lower volume at one of our largest cutting oems due to the timing of orders we expect sales in japan to rebound during the remainder of the year high power laser sales increased  yearoveryear to a record  million driven by cutting and welding applications a key element of our strategy is to drive an increase in demand for high power lasers in new and existing applications which we believe will expand the total market for our fiber lasers over time qcw was another standout in the quarter with record sales of  million growing  yearoveryear from strength in fine welding for consumer electronics applications and percussion hole drilling for aerospace applications we are encouraged by the rapid growth of qcw in the quarter and expect another strong quarter in q however a moderation in the consumer electronics cycle with the completion of key capacity additions later this year for example would cause our rate of growth in qcw to slow medium power laser sales declined  due to decreased demand for finecutting applications and the transition to higher power lasers at one kilowatt and above working our way down the income statement gross margin of  was down  basis points from q  and at the top of our guidance range of  to  we were able to largely offset declines in average selling prices with one improved manufacturing efficiency two component and material cost reductions and three a larger proportion of our sales coming from high power cw high power pulsed and qcw lasers which carry a higher gross margin first quarter operating income was  million or  of sales compared with  million or  of sales in the first quarter of last year excluding foreign exchange operating margins increased to  from  in q of  as we leveraged our costs over higher sales volume as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased to  from  in the same quarter last year rd expenses decreased to  from  and ga expenses decreased to  from  we were able to achieve leverage in all three areas despite higher spending related to product development new applications and manufacturing processes as well as the expansion of our sales force our tax rate in the first quarter was  the tax rate in q  was lower due to the adoption of the revised accounting guidance whereby the excess tax benefit arising from equity grants is now recognized in net income this benefit was  million in q and benefited the tax rate by  percentage points in q we expect the tax rate to be approximately  excluding any effects relating to equity grants net income for the first quarter increased by  to  million on a diluted per share basis we reported  for the first quarter compared with  a year ago in q  the foreign exchange loss decreased eps by  as compared with the same quarter last year decrease of  while the change in accounting standard related to stock option exercise tax benefit increased eps by a net amount of  including the impact of the increase in diluted shares related to the same accounting standard if exchange rates relative to the us dollar had been the same as one year ago we would have expected revenue to be  million higher gross profit to be  million higher and operating expenses to be  million lower we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet ending the quarter with  million in cash cash equivalents and short term investments and  million of debt our current level of inventory on hand amounts to approximately  days which is just slightly above our target range of two turns or approximately  days and above the  yearend level of  days days sales outstanding was  at quarterend compared with  at the end of q  and  days a year ago cash provided by operations during the quarter was  million the  million decrease in operating cash flow versus q  primarily stems from a  million increase in cash used for receivables and a  million increase in cash taxes paid receivables which are impacted by the timing of when revenue is recognized during the quarter can fluctuate from period to period cash taxes can also fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of estimated tax payments its also worth noting that q operating cash flow tends to be below the annual run rate due to the payment of cash bonuses during the quarter we expect to see a significant increase in operating cash flow during the remainder of the year capital expenditures totaled  million for the quarter and we continue to expect  million to  million of capex for the full year including up to  million to upgrade our corporate aircraft net of proceeds from selling the existing one during the quarter we purchased  shares for  million as part of our share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee and director equity compensation and employee stock purchase plans we have now repurchased  total shares for  million since the program began last july moving on to guidance for the second quarter of  we expect revenues to be in the range of  million to  million we anticipate q earnings per diluted share in the range of  to  the midpoint of this guidance represents quarterly revenue and eps growth of approximately  and  respectively yearoveryear the magnitude of our q outperformance and current q revenue guidance has exceeded our expectations when compared to those assumed in our annual guidance of  to  revenue growth in  as such we believe the stronger than expected performance and guidance for the first half of the year should be treated as additive to our full year revenue growth outlook however it should not be used at this time as an assumption for outperformance in the second half of the year while order flow remains strong our visibility into the back half of the year particularly q remains somewhat limited as discussed in more detail in the safe harbor passage of our news release today actual results may differ from both our full year and quarterly guidance due to various factors including but not limited to product demand order cancelation and delays competition and general economic conditions this guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations and is subject to the risks outlined in the companys reports with the sec and assumes exchange rates relative to the us of € rub  ¥ and cny  respectively as a reminder we do not attempt to forecast changes in foreign exchange rates with that valentin and i will be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of patrick newton with stifel please go ahead with your question patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah good morning valentin and tim thank you for taking my question i guess the first one is just on the fullyear guidance commentary and understanding that the first half should be additive to your original guidance if we just take the results the midpoint of your june quarter guidance and then what would appear to be normal seasonality in the back half of the year it would seem to indicate that growth could be  plus for the full year is that the right way to be thinking about the revenue potential this year timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp when we look at that were looking at the midpoint of the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year and adding the outperformance in we get to a slightly lower number than that if you went to  patrick youd be factoringin continued outperformance in the second half of the year which at this point in time were not providing guidance around i think one of the challenges as well is you had an exceptionally strong q a year ago when the momentum that were seeing now really started to pickup that started in q accelerated into q so were bearing in mind that we actually have a pretty difficult comparison in q nonetheless the thing that we do want to call out is that order flow right now remains very strong through april and thats reflected in the q guidance and the strength of order flow through q is reflected in that as well so im not going to get drawn on the  i think ive given enough color around that but if you add the amount that we estimate should be added to the midpoint of the original guidance its quite a bit below that  number patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you for that and then i guess just shifting to the high power growth it was really impressive moving to  plus yearoveryear could you speak a little bit more to the underlying unit growth that you saw in the quarter and then maybe speak a little bit to pricing trends i think that youve recently alluded to them being relatively stable compared to some pricing erosion that happened this time in  timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp so first of all i think the kilowatts of units sold was up by about – kilowatts of power sold was up by  and then valves in reference unit sales up by approximately  so youve got a couple of trends that were seeing there first of all yes some degradation in asps particularly compared to q a year ago the asp situation has been much more stable recently but within that trend youve also got a couple of interesting things first of all asps can be impacted because the actual increase in  kilowatt and  kilowatt lasers the asp per kilowatt on those is slightly lower weve also seen unit volume increases in the  kilowatt and  kilowatts driven by some of the fine processing cutting customers in china and particularly moving up from  watts and  watts to our compact ylr  kilowatt and  kilowatt lasers and weve also seen in the d printing and additive business a transition from some of the medium power to the  kilowatt and  kilowatt lasers for that so those would also contribute to the increase in unit volumes at the lower power levels so theres a number of different dynamics that are happening there id say the really pleasing aspect of that is the general move up in power across several different applications and then the real acceleration that were seeing in the  kilowatts to  kilowatts and now with customers demonstrating  kilowatts cutting systems valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp i can also add hear that  recently published strategy unlimited market review that now last year we control more than  total sales of highpowered kilowatt co  lasers in the world  this year our fare in this business should increase due to performance it would be increased essentially patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc and tim just one clarification or valentin i think in the prepared remarks i just want to make sure i heard this correctly you said over  of high power units are now at  kilowatts and above compared to  a year ago was that accurate timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp  is the number  is patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc  awesome thank you good luck timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp thank you operator our next questions come from the line of krish sankar with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead with your questions krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch yeah hi thanks for taking my question tim i had a couple of them i understand you dont give forward guidance beyond the current quarter but since you said you dont have order visibility into q but im guessing you have some visibility into q should we assume q levels stay at june quarter levels timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp so the color weve given around this is that order flow remains very strong were choosing at this point in time to not give guidance on q but state that the outperformance in the first half of the year should be added to the initial guidance that we gave if order flow remains where it is were going to have – just talking about this in a qualitative manner a good strong q performance as well i mentioned that order flow through april was in no way diminished from what we saw in the first three months of the year and so the overall trends behind the business are very strong were choosing to give the guidance on q rather than get drawn into the second half of the year at the moment when we get to having that visibility in the second half of the year if necessary well provide an updated range to annual guidance id say overall the tone of the business is as good as ive seen it even though weve performed very well over the last couple of years its been an extraordinary period for us and i think that just is a testament to the execution the quality of the product as weve mentioned and the acceleration of the adoption of fiber as compared to other technologies krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch got it thats very helpful and then two other quick questions the capex addition of  million to  million this year you guys said is there a way to quantify what your revenue capacity or how much revenue your diode capacity can generate with that timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp do you want to talk to that valentin a bit more valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp as you see then in analogies market demand for our products growing very fast so of course its a huge challenge for us because we have to produce this year and ship to customers a lot of new ways thats generate additional capacity so   growth per year in our production sales its a very serious challenge for any company ipg up till now has demonstrated enough power to meet this demand and our capital expenses we promote to grow our capacity to build new facility to new equipment and so on i believe we can meet any request of market krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch got it got it thats really helpful and then final question i had was is there a way to kind of like pass through like looking at your products how much of the growth is coming from your traditional fiber laser versus what id call this new market that you entered in the last one year is there a way to figure like how much the core business is contributing to the revenues timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp the core business is still fundamentally driving the revenues at the moment so the newer products are still really just starting out we mentioned some sales of the rgb for the cinema that was a few units but it was good to see that happen so it was a very small contribution theres some acceleration in the telecom business which is helping a little bit but thats more id say a thin layer of icing on a large cake at the moment so if we can continue to execute around getting these newer products into the market into addressing a broader part of the micromaterials processing business we are seeing some penetration in micromaterials processing even with our core  micron product but we hope to see significant improvement in that with some of the ultrafast product and the uv applications so theres still – you know the great thing is theres still not much contribution from those and when they start to come to bear on revenue it should be a good backup that we have valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp  the experience fourway and mired  markets typical  for example with qcw laser we introduced qcw laser to the market six years ago even seven – we claim seven years ago despite it was a great product at all quality was ordered  of value better than existing flash pump we had  existing market was very large market like  units per year or so on but acceptance by market was very small only  first time we exceed  units despite we are estimating our sales should reach we hope should reach  units in  year it was the same even less than  only this year with – see these markets start to grow as a rocket first our oem customer accepts start to using their own flash pump here  and now many other people with major  companies especially in china where other oems start immediately  in europe and the united states and so on and we believe well reach these numbers  plus units soon but you see how many years you need for the oem market to accept even highest quality new products the same situation with other which we introduce now we know now not so naïve to think that market immediately will accept even much better products than exist in the market but during three – we need three five years to deal with that new each of these new products will show a real essential contribution to our total revenue but you have to work introduce or run very fast and try to well coverage  this introduction but it takes time its any new product any series need  very serious and time before you really will have one of the major force in your business operator thank you our next question comes from the line of joe wittine with longbow research please go ahead with your question joe h wittine  longbow research llc hi thank you dr gapontsevs commentary on share gains was interesting since the number of competitive offerings obviously is not shrinking so what is the principle driver if you had to isolate it to one are you more seeing competitors struggle to keep up at sixplus or is it more using price as a weapon i think tim referenced some price takedowns in the prepared comments so i mean i know the products are great but im just trying to get a better sense of the timing and whats driving this inflection now timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp i think competition is finding it extremely difficult to compete across the leading edge of the technology of the product which drives the different performance parameters in terms of electrical efficiency being one beam quality the tremendous scale that we have on manufacturing the service and support we have around the world the application laboratories that support that service and sales the investment thats gone into that all of those things put us in a pretty enviable position i think in terms of applications a couple of the highlights are the welding whilst it can be a bit uneven quartertoquarter depends a bit more on projects theyre starting to get some more momentum into it i think thats great and its not just the consumer electronic cycle spend this year we talked about some of the automotive and other areas for example pipe welding on the cutting side i think this is a difficult thing to state without – theres very little data behind it but one of the things weve said is that you shouldnt just focus on the annual sales of highpowered lasers for cutting applications you should look at how deeply penetrated fiber is into the installed base and there are different numbers in terms of total in store base of cutting systems plus of them around the world fiber a year ago was probably less than  of that installed base now were being not as aggressive maybe only  we think theres an acceleration of the replacement of some of the older co lasers because job shops just cannot be competitive with that technology as more and more fiber lasers are deployed in the field right so theyre increasing against job shops that have a fiber laser the co even if its older and fully depreciated with its high maintenance and running costs is just no longer a viable alternative and weve seen that commentary coming out of a couple of surveys that weve seen so its a number of different things across different applications then youve got some of the other applications in ablation the cleaning the holedrilling was a good contributor on the qcw so the qcw wasnt just welding and these are all area that were looking for growth so its across a variety of different things that were succeeding at joe h wittine  longbow research llc great and then ill also ask on the sustainability of the current trend i mean i know you suggested we dont carry this forward into the second half which is prudent and tim i know youre not going to guide the first half of next year but at least qualitatively talk us through how much of this first half upside in total that youre seeing if any is either onetime in nature or perhaps represents any sort of catchup from last year like on those ce investments that kind of skipped a year or is this trend youre executing on here purely organic i know its tough to answer but any comments could help us kind of not get too out in front of our skis as we adjust our models for next year timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp so the great thing is that its across a variety of applications and a lot of those applications are generally sort of organic with what we think are sustainable trends in the market and the one thing thats just – is always a twoyear cycle is the consumer electronics stuff but certainly the outperformance that were showing in the first half of the year isnt just driven by that thats really no – a relatively even small part of it of course thats probably a bit of a thicker layer of icing on the cake than the newer applications but its not just that it is the cutting and the welding those ablative processes the drilling which is a shift that youre seeing across a variety of different industries so its difficult to call it out for next year yet but we think were in an exceptionally strong position relative to the other technologies and even nonlaser technologies at this point in time operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jagadish iyer with summit redstone please go ahead with your questions jagadish k iyer  summit redstone partners llc yeah thanks for taking my question congrats tim and valentin my first question is how should we be thinking about gross margin i would imagine that if you look at your revenue profile and how youre guiding and compare it with last year your mix is clearly moving to a favorable highpower laser types i thought your gross margins would have picked up can you talk about your puts and takes for gross margins as we move forward and i have a followup timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp we continue to remain in that range of  to  and are very very pleased with executing at the top end of that range weve mentioned that youre always trying to balance the declines in asps across different product lines with new product introductions and getting a benefit from the higher power lasers in different product categories that we get to we also are adding manufacturing capacity valentin mentioned that weve got a tremendous uptick in unit and kilowatts of power that we have to keep up with so you also try to balance your manufacturing efficiency with the semifixed labor costs that are brought on the fixed costs that are brought on with increasing depreciation as youre placing buildings and equipment into service so im delighted with where gross margins are at this point in time i think valentin would probably second that on the cost side i think one of the interesting things here is that we think the market price of diodes is still around  per watt of course some companys manufacturing is below that our bill of material fully loaded on a large part of our kilowatt lasers is now at less than the market price but the entire bill of material on a cost per watt basis is less than the market price of diodes at the moment so if nothing else that should be taken as a point to tremendous advantage to the company valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp well use our advantage for control of the foremost technology we need for our product its a result were working very hard to decrease the costs of each components for example that same diode over here again would drop  we drop cost per watt and allinall  compared was only five years ago our cost per one watt per diode perhaps two times cheaper than it was four years ago and were planning  to improve technology automation and the process and so on and were going down down much faster than other people doing this the same with other components parts and so on jagadish k iyer  summit redstone partners llc okay so as a followup question tim specifically on q what is providing the strength and which geography and by the way did you disclose any backlog information thank you timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp no we didnt disclose any backlog information as usual the sort of strength on order flow is really reflected in the guidance number its pretty similar to what were seeing in q well get another good quarter out of china showing strong yearoveryear growth the momentum in europe continues to be good youll see a pickup in japan in q less meaningful but good backlog in korea and russia the us as well has a good opening backlog so theres no fundamental change its just a continuation of the overall trends operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bobby burleson with canaccord please go ahead with your questions robert joseph burleson  canaccord genuity inc yeah good morning so just curious if theres any particular vertical or geography youre watching more closely to get a read on q timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp nothing in particular i think its just waiting for the overall trends on order flow through end of q and into the beginning of q seeing how those are going to materialize you can see – in about  of the time you see q being lower than q and thats generally driven by in those years where you have a strong consumer electronics cycle you can see china revenue a bit lower in q so well watch that but we watch everything bobby in terms of the different geographies and applications valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp my personal opinion – tim was very careful much more careful to deal with above answer  because you see consumer electronic may be second half of the year or some time could be a worth business but in the share of our consumer electronic and our business its only   even they drop twice it would be a very small impact at our quarterly revenue so i dont worry about what happens second half of the year with chinese consumer electronics like happen with some other people so i dont see its as a serious impact on our business this situation robert joseph burleson  canaccord genuity inc okay great thanks and then just thoughts on automotive it looks like theres some mixed data points out there on demand depending on where you look just curious how much visibility you have for that particular vertical i know you dont have always look through to the actual end applications but any thoughts on automotive from here timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp so automotive i think is strong and its certainly strong and weaker stronger in some areas and weaker in others so the real strength on automotive at the moment is north america and china in particular europes okay not showing tremendous growth yearoveryear on the automotive applications and japan might be an area where were starting to get some indications from some of the major customers there that maybe in the second half of the year the automotive investment cycle may start to improve there where its been – id call japan as well sluggish like europe over the last year or so but youre right we dont have – its not like the traditional oem business where you can rank your predictive visibility more fundamentally operator okay thank you our next question comes from the line of joe maxa with dougherty  company please go ahead with your questions joe maxa  dougherty  company llc thank you i just wonder if you could remind us on your relative size of your cutting versus welding business and then the growth rates of those timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp sorry i think weve disclosed in the k and this is very approximate number because i could caution you again the application date that we get sometimes is not the most accurate but in all cutting applications both highpower and midpower and even some of the qcw is about  of total revenue the welding is about  and then marking and engraving will be the next biggest application after that the two main ones cutting and welding at those levels joe maxa  dougherty  company llc right timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp and thats of course multiple products joe not just highpower joe maxa  dougherty  company llc okay and you saw some strong growth in welding so i was trying to get that is what do you think the growth rate is of these two segments now and what are your opportunities i mean i know theres still a big market out there but where are you going to see the most growth coming here in the next say year or two timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp trends on cutting continue to be very strongly we continue to see the displacement of the installed base of lasers and then move towards higher power both with fine metal and that should continue to provide some sustained growth for the company clearly the welding market is one that we have called out we see that over a threeyear horizon as being a fundamental area where we want to execute not just on highpower but on qcw as well in terms of like a three to fiveyear time horizon welding the welding market were targeting and growing substantially by displacing not only existing laser but nonlaser welding technology as well joe maxa  dougherty  company llc right valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp in the welding market still penetration on laser is very low its due to much more difficult work in this direction because each customer needs customized solution the most of these welding players or companies many of them even dont know about opportunities and where is the new opportunities which way is open for them so its a more difficult market to build but it has huge potential in our opinion whether itd be i said it before we only can confirm this but its absolutely different approach than cutting in cutting market you still from what  or  years installed  co cutters with co lasers now what its still until a couple years ago it was  what people argued different advantage co or fiber but now all market practical and they said fiber provides enormous advantage to co laser in other words recognized and not only it is cheaper better easy to use but productivity with fiber laser now two three times is becoming higher than productivity the same cutting machine with co laser its major engine for future and the people we expect will start mass replacement of co machines even if they could be used its still working by fiber because the companies who use co approach now will generate more if theyre not able more to use own technology welding still only starting to penetrate volume of welding market on our estimation  times more than current penetration still big opportunities but we develop many other applications again each of them separately attempts new application even outside of the metal weld processing but each of them still small few tens million dollars award but during some years we expect each of them will contribute  million multiple by  different it would be very essential growth for other nonmetal applications but it takes time not during one development  unique new products its only first step then one way to introduce provide and to build the market and the distribution network and so only medical for this year for last time we reached an excellent result in the program and overall to replace traditional volume in yag with our new tooling approach its so big advantage and you must rate in its now covered statistics and operation  operation very successful made now but we expect only this  its only one from many medical applications were working now creating new business its some hundred million business and we qualify this new first approval for people to demonstrate fantastic new results operator okay thank you our next question comes from the line of tom hayes with northcoast research please go ahead with your question thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc thanks good morning thanks for taking my questions tim i guess regarding china i know last year you mentioned that some of the growth in that region came from signing new oems is some of the growth you saw this quarter and the expectations for the second quarter an indication that youre continuing to gain traction with those relationships or maybe just talk about the growth drivers in that market thank you timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp yeah i think thats part of it to continue to gain traction with those relationships continuing to compete fiercely against even the local companies like raycus and other competitors there youve actually seen also a rebound in the business with our largest oem there this year and thats benefiting from recovery in their cutting markets so that customer continues to be very much sourcing their fiber laser technology at highpower and qcw from ipg so theres different end market dynamics there so youve got the welding market for ev electronic vehicles for batteries and other applications continues to be a driver too thomas hayes  northcoast research partners llc great thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of james ricchiuti with needham  company please go ahead with your questions jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc hi just a followup to again the question about china i mean the revenues that you started the year in china significantly above the high watermark last year how much of a surprise was the start that you got off to in china i mean obviously you had bookings good bookings in backlog but just wondering were there some other issues in the quarter and it sounds like that momentum has continued through april timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp yeah it definitely has continued through april theres clearly a surprise with the strength with which china started at because you always think that in january china orders are going to be slow before china new year and that order flow is very strong and then it carried on through february and march so yeah its difficult to quantify like clearly relative to guidance and the outperformance you can see how much of a surprise that has been to us i think sometimes the inflection points on the upside jim are some of the most difficult things to forecast regardless of how good your relationships are with the oems i think the oems themselves find it very difficult to forecast sometimes the adoption curve that they see on some of the applications for example the move towards higher power levels and thats not just in china its even in europe as well valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp but a list of oem customers in china for last year half year increased dramatically before it was only couple serious oem in china now we have  oems the competition is growing there very fast all of that start to purchase in quantities serious quantities for us its about a new oem customer in china not only in china but in china it was  so its not only – were talking about shippable order with fixed date of delivery date and so on but its to include also the frame order its fantastic growth into countries but then growth for frame order we dont take them into account in our backlog but the frame orders its never before we talk about such large quantities jim ricchiuti  needham  company llc has the customer concentration the profile of the customer base changed did that change much dramatically in the quarter in china timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp no fundamentally i think that this is pleasing actually youll see our former largest customer will report some stronger sales this year so relatively speaking a little bit more of a concentration there but also as valentin mentioned many new oems across a variety of applications as well operator thank you our next question valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp in many case we dont know the application even we dont know operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark miller with the benchmark company please go ahead with your question mark miller  the benchmark company llc congratulations on your results very impressive i was just wondering you cited a number of reasons for the upside numbers in guidance you did say china was stronger than expected how much of the upside and the expectations is driven by overall macro improvements globally timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp its only thing thats having a benefit youre seeing overall i think global pmis are at or close to fiveyear highs theyre at that level coming into the end of the year and through q you continue to see some improvement in the european economic environment and theres a bit more momentum there the us economy clearly at the moment is pretty strong china credit remains available so yeah i think the global economies is as strong as it has been for a while and that helps with the industrial investment cycle mark miller  the benchmark company llc while its not a big part of your sales there is some concern about slowing up the telecom business in china you said china was very strong is that too small to be concerned about for you guys timothy p v mammen  ipg photonics corp yeah were not big on telecom in china at the moment its a very small part of our business most of our telecom is outside of china mark miller  the benchmark company llc finally the uv fiber laser any more color you can provide there you said new products were coming but not as quickly as some people believed in terms of the sales valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp yes uv product its very difficult product because what we introduce it compete with the same quality of  people sales now which it need enormous service concern services so on we removed lifetime of crystals and so on we dont try to go this way our culture is to provide with highest quality absolutely industry grade product we developed a family of uv products and still  a long time a  improving and so on but now weve introduced – its also the most critical for this new highest quality crystal growth facility and not only growth crystal but also the process increase to make a new gen a new level higher grade crystal element for uvs and weve opened this now facility and we developed new technology for nonlinear crystals which provide  better quality and lifetime also then exist in other sources with this new crystal weve done the uv business on absolutely new level with quality lifetime cost and so on but the process is going very well but it takes time to really introduce and qualify people and then after that the major oe these integrators need also time then for test and for qualify for the applications and it builds a system it takes a couple of years but we introduced this product now with much higher quality than all existing in this market segment and based on new technology first of all crystal and also a higher polishing technology record  and so on to deal with with such new technology of course well change situation on uv waves – uv markets the same by the way with ultrashort pulse lasers the same situation today were now near the  with ultrashort pulse systems laser we have perhaps new unique patent pending with much higher performance than all existing in this market segment though but it takes time introduction we mentioned to deal with materialwise in hundred millions it takes some years not immediately operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tom diffely with da davidson please go ahead with your questions thomas robert diffely  da davidson  co yes good morning so obviously it looks like youre getting some nice momentum here at the high end of the market competitively but what are you seeing at the low power market from a competitive point of view and in particular in the chinese market valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp low power market you mean market – marking market market – marking market stagnate in china it became absolutely not profitable practical with people working with zero margin even a major play in this market chinese said actually we dont like to provide names they support still or have thinking of to convert for them this market or support it waiting when situation will change when the small competitor many tens or hundreds competitors would destroy all the price policy and so on will disappear will become bankrupt then they will deal with – remain only few players and would be renewed this recover this market but now the market practically dont generate any real profit were still more competitive but we have to follow the prices and so they will drop the essential price still is enough profitable here but the total price now for them traditional  to watt is not about lasers for the main forces  with this market drop  times to less than   and so not able to now to generate profit even chinese company dont able to generate any profit thomas robert diffely  da davidson  co so are you seeing a lot of those companies start to drop off then or you think thats coming valentin p gapontsevm phd  ipg photonics corp were still filling and quoting the quantity we will increase units but in revenue its stabilized now not growing practical for us we start to grow the marking business due to new high grade lasers which still highpower and much more perfect and  laser still not – chinese not able to compete with us to produce it so on there we have normal start to growing sales but for standard lasers for mass market we sell in quantity but the revenue not growing  in spite for us its still profitable because our production cost minimum twice cheaper than any chinese co operator

communications entertainment medical biotechnology scientific and advance applications revenue  billion  number of employees  date  oct  website wwwipgphotonicscom ipg photonics is a manufacturer of fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers ipg is headquartered in oxford massachusetts and operates internationally ipg photonics developed and commercialized optical fiber lasers which are used in a variety of applications including materials processing medical applications and telecommunications ipg has manufacturing facilities in the united states germany russia and italy corporate historyedit ipg was founded in  in russia by physicist valentin p gapontsev a pioneer in the field of fiber lasers and recipient of various awards in the beginning ipg made customized glass and crystal lasers wireless temperature meters for hyperthermy and laser components the foundations of the industrial fiber laser revolution have been laid in  when the company began focusing on the development of highpower fiber lasers and amplifiers and a scheme for sidepumping of dualclad singlemode fibers has been discovered by dr vp gapontsev with coworkers the sidepumping technique very efficiently converts multimode pump light from multiple laser diodes in one output from a singlemode fiber together with the fiber’s large surfaceto volume ratio allowing the simplest and most efficient cooling schemes and allsolid state architecture insensitive to dirt and vibration these developments resulted in the most energy efficient lowcost compact robust and reliable laser the firm received its first major contract from telecommunications carrier italtel ipg then won a second major contract from daimlerbenz aerospace dornier branch the company opened a facility in germany in  and established world headquarters in the usa in  in  ipg invested in new highcapacity production facilities to manufacture its own diode pumps a major component of its fiber lasers and amplifiers as a result ipg is able

financing guaranteed how to choose a laserlipo machine get this report before buying a ward photonics ™ if youre like most practitioners youre excited about the potential of a laserlipo machine but youre also confused about which one to purchase make the right decision and you could add hundreds of thousands to your bottom line and have hundreds of raving fans but the wrong decision could leave you with unhappy customers who spread bad word of mouth about you and a machine collecting dust in the spare room the woods are full of good and bad machines and machines without systems so be careful first rule dont pick a machine simply because it has a big brand behind it it often just means they have clever marketing and deep pockets and theres no guarantee it will meet the specific needs of your customers dont get brainwashed by big make sure you look at the science behind the claims choose your machine as you would anything else look at the data analyse the science behind the claims and interview five or six companies ask them questions like will your machine work on all skin types will tanned people indian native american and asian people see equally good results does your laserlipo come with an effective and proven marketing system for attracting clients is it safe technology which is clinically proven to get results without inflicting pain on clients is the technology approved by the fda there are many other questions and thats why weve created this special report entitled outsmarting laserlipo lemons  questions to ask which reveals how you can make an informed decision without getting ripped off it exposes what most laserlipo manufacturers dont want you to know including the type of machines which make your clients gain back fat in unnatural places if you dont fancy the idea of having angry clients on your hands after funnyfat has grown back on their elbows knees  back  then avoid these machines like the plague the only class of device that doesnt require a doctor to operate it saving you thousands in wages that eat into your profits the question you must ask if youre considering a light machine hint this is what produces the results  yet many suppliers gloss over it beware if your supplier doesnt offer this it could cost you thousands of dollars  upset your clients make sure they can and will deliver on it before you sign on the dotted line the secret of quickly getting a return on investment from your machine and turning it into cash  ignoring this could leave you with an expensive machine gathering dust and taking up space the report also reveals what you must ask to ensure staff training is as easy as    for both current  future employees how to ensure your supplier covers you against purchasing a bomb how to get a complete system for lead generation and much much more only after asking a battery of wellconsidered questions will you finally be able to relax with the knowledge and confidence that youve purchased the right machine for the needs of your practice this report gives you these questions titlemrmrsdrms i would like to discuss this with dr jamie to see if laser like lipo is right for me select  yes no   if you are thinking about purchasing a lipolight ™ or any other machine then you need this report that reveals everything you need to know including  startling questions  of suppliers hope you never ask so who

difference between laser light and led light is that laser is coherent light when you shine a laser through fluid as easily tested by shining a laser pointer through a glass of water laser becomes noncoherent light or exactly the same as led and what percentage of the body is waterfluid so most of the results of the laser devices is the light energy and not actually the laser light and clinical
