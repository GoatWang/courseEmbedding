highest rates of growth in the world during the s however the country became notorious for its economic problems growth nearly ceased inflation accelerated and indebtedness grew here is the only comprehensive uptodate analysis of this troubled economy the product of a cooperative research effort it contains contributions by seventeen top israeli economists many of whom have served as advisers to the israeli government and thus are able to draw on firsthand knowledge of the country’s economic administration and policy making their interpretation makes use of original empirical data and emphasizes the unique political economy of the country and its institutional structure the book considers both microeconomic and macroeconomic issues with sections devoted to growth and structural change human resources the public sector including defense the problems of an open economy and the dynamics of inflation it becomes clear that israel’s current difficulties are rooted in its history and political culture the authors’ prescription for a cure is rigorous israel’s administrators must be willing to alter their longstanding accommodating monetary policies and the country must substantially change the organization of its major economic sectors in order to become more selfreliant the book will be invaluable to scholars professional economists bankers journalists policymakers and specialists in foreign affairs some sections would be ideal for course use the less technical chapters—such as the introduction which provides essential historical and political context—will be

immigration immigration has shaped the rate of growth of the jewish population and its demographic composition it also created much of the socioeconomic diversity within the jewish population this chapter discusses aggregatelevel interactions between jewish immigration and economic growth both in the jewish sector of mandatory palestine and in israel under the british mandate a jewish economy existed alongside an arab one the jewish population in  was so small that it hardly constituted an economic entity but the rapid growth of that population  immigrants in  and a concurrent huge growth of product with its own institutional structure created a distinct jewish economy separate but not completely isolated from the arab sector metzer  since  the jewish economy and the economy of israel have been synony mous with only a small arab sector remaining integrated into the general economy after the  war however the west bank and the gaza strip became part of the israeli market and the labor pool there both benefited from the higher wages in the israeli market and acted as a buffer to domestic fluctuations both szereszewskis  estimates of product and capital for the years  and the estimates for the first years of statehood are necessarily rough so that comparisons with the more recent period are difficult the estimates for  are particularly rough and are not considered here these are some of the factors that prevent treatment of the entire period  as a single block how from the israeli economy maturing through crises edited by yoram ben porath copyright  by the president and fellows of harvard college q reprinted by permission of harvard university press ever because the mandate period provides a useful perspective on the relationship between population and economic growth in the period of statehood most of the discussion here will refer to both periods nahum gross  divided the mandate period into two major sub periods  and  each began with a very large wave of immigration in  the jewish population of palestine was   immigrants arrived in  adding  percent to the population each year  percent in  alone in  the jewish population was   immigrants arrived in   adding  percent annually and another  came in  sicron  in the quartercentury before  the jewish population increased eight fold with the population more than doubling on average each decade and reached approximately  by the end of the period the total product of the jewish economy in palestine in the same years increased twentyfivefold at an average annual rate of  percent the total stock of capital increased fifteenfold szereszewski  from mid to the end of   immigrants arrived averag ing  percent of the general population annually  and  percent in  and  respectively by the end of  the jewish population had more than doubled to  million in the next two decades it redou bled growing  and  percent respectively the s marked the end of an exceptionally high and sustained period of population growth with an increase of  percent for the decade over the period  the jewish population grew from  to  million immigration contributed  and natural increase  from  to  total product increased elevenfold and capital stock sixteenfold product tripled in the first decade doubled in the second but from  to  total product increased only  percent most remarkable is the high growth rate of per capita income that tended to accompany the rapid increase of population percent annually in the mandate period a similarly high rate in  and  percent in  in contrast to  percent in  table  figure  shows the correspondence between the ratio of immigrants to mean jewish population and the growth rates of gnp the correlation is  in both the mandate and state periods the correlation between immigration and per capita gnp is much lower it is hard to detect consistent leads or lags in the earlier period after  however cycles in immigration tend to follow cycles in gnp figure  shows a remarkable correspondence between fluctuations in immigration and in the growth rate of capital stock before  and the idea to incorporate the mandate period in this analysis came from moshe syrquin who performs his own longterm analysis in chapter  table  rates of growth of jewish population product and capital  percentages  annual rates of increase capital stock share of immigrants interval

rate of capital i  stock i  figure  immigration and capital growth   s after  in the latter period the correspondence holds for both dwelling and nondwelling capital not shown in addition to three large swings in immigration and economic growth in the midos the midos and  there are shortterm cyclical comovements a glaring exception is the period of the arab boycott and disruptions in  followed by world war  when growth picked up while immigration declined the shortterm movements are more clearly discernible in the years after the last big swing such aggregate relationships between immigration and economic growth have been studied for the united states jerome  observed the responsiveness of migration to employment conditions kuznets and rubin  and kuznets  observed the relationships between long swings in the growth of product and immigration for the period before world war i they found that the long swings in net immigration tended to follow those in gross national product per worker and to pre cede those in the constant dollar volume of residential construction  p  abramowitz  explored what he dubbed kuznets cycles and emphasized the roles of demand and intensity of factor utili zation in bringing about an increase in population through migration and an increase in capital stock several studies discussed the response of immigration to inverse swings in economic growth in the united states and the european countries of origin easterlin  has shown that the cessation of large immigration shifted the demographic response to fertility population as an engine of growth the record of longterm growth in total product and jewish population in palestine and israel is truly exceptional by world standards see chap ter  also remarkable is the fact that in israel such high rates of popula tion increase were accompanied by a longterm increase in per capita income in fiftynine years of recorded growth per capita income is reported to have declined in only twelve the united states also experi enced growth in per capita income during the periods of rapid population increase before world war i there is no proof however that the growth in per capita income was caused by population growth and the debate surrounding the favorable effects of population growth continues see simon  steadystate growth theory does not provide much useful guidance for understanding and interpreting the effect of population growth through immigration on the economy immigration affects the economy through the supply side by expanding the supply of labor and often of capital it generates surges in demand that directly affect the level of activity and may induce further changes in factor supplies obviously the rate of immigrationwhich dictated the rate of popula tion increasewas a dominant factor in changing israels workingage population and the labor supply however as the composition of immi grants by country of origin and age has changed so too has the translation of immigration into workingage population most of the pre immi grants were of or near working age  and in this respect resembled european migrants to other countries the surge of immigrants in   included a high proportion of families with many children conse quently between  and  the workingage population grew at significantly lower rates than the total population table  during that period net immigration directly contributed between onehalf and twothirds to the growth of the adult population immigrant children growing to adulthood also made a significant net contribution to the adult population over twothirds in contrast to less than onethird by the israeliborn from  on however the israeliborn contributed a rapidly growing share to the growth of the adult population even though direct immigration in the early s was still significant the foreign born made a net negative contribution to the adult population in that decade in the growth of the labor force the foreignborn contributed threequarters in  about half in   and only  percent in  benporath  there have also been sharp differences in the skill levels of immigrants the pre  percent european immigrants were among the most highly educated population in the world easterlin a the immi grants arriving in  had a much lower level of schooling ac cording to one estimate the per capita human capital of immigrants age  in those years was  percent that of the pre population  percent for the europeanborn and  percent for immigrants from asia and africa see baruh  this situation changed after the first decade the immigrants of the s had slightly more schooling than the  host population those of the s had a significantly higher level of schooling than the host population  percent of those arriving in   came from europe and america mostly from the ussr compared with  percent in  and  percent in  see cbs  immigration initially entails the obsolescence of skills acquired in the country of origin the process of economic absorption involves learning the host countrys language other specific skills of living and onthe job acquisition of skills mass immigration was associated with a decline not only in level of education but also in the level of countryspecific skills in israel this phenomenon is expressed in dramatic occupational changes and upward occupational mobility benporath a it is documented in amir  table  growth of the jewish male population age   percentages total change all ages age  israeliborn age  foreign born maturing in foreign born maturing outb net

also in the crosssection differentials in earnings associated with length of residence hanoch  levy  amir   the average length of stay in israel increased following mass immigration kuznets  estimated that this factor contributed approximately  percent to growth in the s and s because the effect of length of stay in israel on earnings diminishes over time as the proportion of new immigrants declines this factor lost its relevance in the s the response of capital depends on the supply of resources available for capital formation that is capital imports and domestic savings and on the demand for investment immigration creates direct demand for housing and exerts an indirect effect through consumptionderived de mand for producer capital in addition the increased supply of labor raises the demand for capital in the mandate period private capital im ports were substantial and were directly related to immigrationthe correlation between private capital imports and immigration for   is  there is also some evidence that institutional capital imports were related to population growth gross and metzer  the post  immigration brought insignificant private capital imports capital imports were mostly in the hands of the public sector driven by a demand created by immigration and other factors no analysis is available on the effect of immigrants on domestic savings obviously part probably a substantial one of the negative publicsector savings can be attributed to the gap between the demand for services created by immigrants and their initially low contribution to the tax base an important element in the effect of population on economic growth is based on increasing returns to scale despite rapid growth in the man date period the jewish population was still small in  the mandate authorities restricted immigration on the grounds of limited absorptive capacity that is strongly decreasing returns to scale in the short run in the long run however there were increasing returns to scale the establishment of israel in the midst of a war dramatized the issue of minimum viable population size not only in terms of physical survival but also in economic terms empirically this phenomenon raises a related question is the rate of technical change independent of the rate and nature of population growth as shown by metzer  the period of rapid growth in per capita income is associated not only with an increase in capital per capita but also with an increase in total factor productivity he points to a correlation of  between total hours of work and total factor productivity how did immigration affect public and private consumption the pub lic sector played an inordinately large role in the economy in part because of the need to provide immigrants with employment shelter and services followed by a more gradual social and economic absorption effort the public sectors continued involvement in improving housing and provid ing employment health services and education had a lasting effect on its size and function extending well beyond the period of mass immigration on the aggregate level there is no systematic statistical relationship between civilian public consumption and population growth for the post  period in the mandate period cyclical movements were transmitted from population to product unmitigated by active government macroeco nomic policy indeed because the role of government has been much more dominant since  than in the mandate period macroeconomic fluctuations have been affected by a variety of other considerations the creation of a large public sector was partly induced by immigration in a variety of ways through the need to provide the services and means of absorption the desire to control the process such as the control of initial geographic allocation and the desire to provide employment directly in hard times to groups experiencing labormarket difficulties but immigra tion cannot explain the significant growth in publicsector employment in the s see chapter  in the period  private per capita consumption doubled this rapid rise in the standard of living occurred while a large fraction of resources was devoted to capital formation and a rising share was devoted to defenseobviously at the expense of the foreign account although economists such as patinkin  protested at the time the govern ments strategy may have been considered necessary to promote social cohesion discourage emigration and attract further immigration other wise growth itself might have been jeopardized the growth in per capita consumption continued in the period of slower population growth   what requires an explanation is the fact that during the stagnant years  per capita consumption continued to increase more than onethird over the decade while product per capita rose no more than  percent the natural shortterm effect of immigration on total product is quite different it is reasonable to expect immigration to push up aggregate demand initially and then to raise labor supply creating cycles see mer hav  it is no simple matter to find statistical support for the effects of popula tion growth and to differentiate them from shortterm relationships as mentioned earlier there were three long swings in immigration a major event such as mass immigration must have left a lasting impression on economic life yet for this very reason it cannot be captured by a regres sion similarly it is hard to isolate the effect of immigration on the extensive role of government in the public sector the series are too short for a quantitative illustration of the effect of immigration on the economy see merhav  table  rate of growth of the capital stock regressions  dependent variable and period rc ap rcapd

statistical verification of the longterm hypotheses and the statistical relationships are probably dominated by shortterm relationships i first examine a series of regressions in which the economic

of causality also has both long and shortterm aspects immigration emigration and the rate of natural increase are responsive to income and employment opportunities shortterm fluctuations in these variables also reflect the adjustment of the timing of migration or fertility to economic fluctuations as already mentioned there ts a long tradition of studies on the cyclical responsiveness of immigration such as jerome  in studies of long swings in immigration and fertility kuznets  abramowitz   and easterlin   b all emphasize the dominant role of demand conditions in the united states in initiating waves of immigration this is probably not the case in israel the immi gration waves before  were not caused by economic fluctuations  in palestine apparently exogenous shocks in the countries of origin including economic fluctuations there constituted dominant push fac tors this does not however rule out the possibility that rising unem ployment following an initial boom checked further immigration and diverted it elsewhere there is also evidence that the immigration policy of the zionist movement was sensitive to the conditions of employment the mass immigration of  was certainly independent of the domestic economic scene in israel for most of these displaced jews from europe and jewish communities from arab countries israel was the only option economic conditions in israel affected immigration in the early years of statehood largely through the immigration policies of the govern ment and the jewish agency thus the lull in immigration after  reflected a reaction to the economic hardships associated with immigra tion in later years immigration of entire communities diminished and became dependent on political turning points in various eastern european and latin american countries the last and most significant was the partial relaxation of soviet emigration restrictions in  and it is quite possible that the declining share of those arriving in israel out of those leaving the soviet union reflects a response to economic conditions in israel as immigration declined in volume it grew more and more depen dent on individual choice and as such on economic conditions another implication of the decline in immigration is that the relative weight of emigration in the fluctuations of net migration which is the difference between immigration and emigration increased lamdany  has shown that emigration from israel responds to economic fluctuations and in this respect the experience of the  recession influences current policy table  shows that in  the rates of immigration net migra tion and population growth respond weakly to current and significantly to threeyear lagged rates of increase in per capita consumption a similar relationship holds for per capita gnp for  the relation figure  growth rates of per capita gnp and total fertility  is strong with current and oneperiod lagged variables similar results are reported by ablin a there is also evidence that the birth rate is responsive to economic fluctuations benporath b data for the longer period  seem to suggest that after  the simple associations no longer hold figure   causality tests causality between population and product runs both ways the only empirical grip available is the sequence in which the variations occur according to the procedure suggested by granger

cause y if lagged x has an independent effect on current y after y is purged of all its autocorrelation the causality tests were run with lags for each variable the period  is generally excluded from the analysis where gnp figures are concerned because the linkage among the different series of estimates for the period is dubious table  shows the main results of the causality tests there is strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that in the mandate period immigration caused economic growth on the other hand most of the evidence on causality from the economic indicators to population is for the post period the growth rates of per capita table  results of causality tests annual rates of growth  direction of causality period variable and istatistic variable gnppc immig gnppc pop gnppc

total gnp and of per capita or total private consumption cause the rate of population gowth the ratio between immigrants and population and the net immigration ratio there is twoway causality between the unemployment rate and the growth rate of population in  that is unemployment is the only economic variable that also affects immigration in this period a marginally significant relationship in both directions is also observed between the growth rate of per capita income and the ratio of immigrants to population in  but vanishes for  oneway causality is indicated from population or immigration to the growth in capital stockit is very clear in the mandate period and marginally significant in the statehood period the test certainly confirms the visual impression pined from figure  that immigration leads capital conclusion this brief study of the twoway relationship between population and growth found stronger evidence for causality from immigration to eco nomic growth in the mandate period for the whole period  it is very clear that immigration pushed the rate of increase of capital stock for the period from  on immigration responded to the growth rate of per capita income or consumption the graphs show both strong correspondence with and exceptions to the comovements of population and product such as the large growth in product and the downturn in immigration during world war  there were swings associated with three large waves of immigration two in the mandate period and the mass immigration in the early years of statehood each provided a push to economic growth that affected the economy for many years the drive provided by these waves of immigrants seems to have lost momentum sometime in the mids further exogenous waves of equal magnitude failed to emerge in addition to the swings there were shortterm varia tions it is quite possible that the two types of fluctuations are responsible for the difference in the dominant direction of causality between the periods the swings largely represent the effect of population on the econ omy and they dominate the mandate period and the early state period the response of immigration to per capita income was more closely related to shortterm variations whereas in the early period this relation ship was swamped and dominated by the largely exogenous long swings the latter period allowed this dependence of immigration on the economy to emerge but there may be another substantive reason for the difference between the periods the israeli governments large role in the economy may have eliminated or suppressed the shortterm effects of population movements on the economy the evidence strongly supports the notion that the economic stagnation of the past decade had a demographic component after half a century of extraordinarily rapid growth in population total product and per capita product the slowdown in population growth and the stagnation in productivity growth despite continued growth in the capital stock must have reinforced one another although there are important autono mous reasons for boththe depletion of sources of immigration the energy crises and decadelong worldwide economic stagflationthe response of population to the economic loss of momentum may have aggra vated the situation references abramowitz m the nature and significance of kuznets cycles eco
