stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy touching on religion feminism and life in multicultural london however he also employs metahumour and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as callback in an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke preferring the more simplistic material or enjoying the work of more mainstream arena comedians such as michael mcintyre or lee mack lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics more commercial success lee has a reputation for being politically correct and of the liberal elite and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of political correctness gone mad for comic effectcitation needed lee caused controversy on his if you prefer a milder comedian tour with a routine about top gear presenter richard hammond referring to hammonds accident while filming in  in which he was almost killed lee joked i wish he had been decapitated the daily mail termed this an extraordinary attack and having been doorstepped by a mail journalist lee quoted the routine by replying its a joke just like on top gear when they do their jokes lee subsequently explained the joke the idea of whats acceptable and whats shocking thats where i investigate i mean you cant be on top gear where your only argument is that its all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad and then not accept the counterbalance to that put simply if clarkson can say the prime minister is a oneeyed scottish idiot then i can say that i hope his children go blind — stewart lee in an observer interview sean ohagan says of the hammond joke that lee operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence often adopting as in this instance the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy selected worksedit

dragged it on for far too long often repeating himself after long silences he doesnt interact with the audience which is a major negaitve giving how close he is to them during the show and looking straight at the camera during it to try and engage with the audience at home is needless and desperate without doubt the joke he done lying on his back was the worst i was embarressed for him by the end he doesnt fall into any particular categories he is not edgy enough to shock the audience and he lacks persona and stage presence not creative enought to preach a political mantra or try something that hasnt been done hundreds of times by different comedians and he doesnt have any angle beside the boring grumpy middle aged man and he is not fat he should stop saying that he is the sketches

that it might be of use to like minded comedy fans in a nutshell it was the worst comedy show ive ever ever sat through that i can remember anyway what could explain it i wondered to myself i clearly like dara obriains comedy why did this not appeal to me well i think whats happened is this a comedian knows comedy so if you present a and b and c together the comedian can probably immediately see how they fit together even if hes never heard the joke before we also know that laughing is a result of the unexpected stewart lee seems to put together a and b and c in unexpected ways this means comedians might find it funny but the general public would find utterly unfunny to give an analogy picasso could actually paint really really well almost photographic quality it was only when he broke all the rules of painting that he became famous though and people said he was a genius but if all you saw was his messed up paintings of women with a nose where their ear should be you could be forgiven for saying this guy cant paint why is he famous stewart lee i think might be the picasso of comics he didnt make me laugh but professional comics can probably appreciate it and laugh or whatever of course that could all be rubbish maybe hes hilarious and i just dont get it but i dont personally see much difference between a guy who studiously and ironically pretends not to be funny and pretends to have a comedic routine fall apart on stage and pretends to restart the show and a guy who simply is not funny and whos comedic routine falls apart and has to restart the show  john r finnan amazon think id rather listen to that documentary on moss than watch anymore stewart lee  gonzonmouse youtube stewart lee is about as funny as a car crash he really is the most boring comedian out there i thought he was unfunny last time i saw him surely a tiny requisite for being a comedian is to be at least slightly funny a total hypocrite  he has a go at people making money from writing books  which is something he does and then goes on to make other points that he himself does stewart lee is just a hypocritial unfunny weird looking gobshite hed be crap on top gear he seems to be from the jack dee school of unfunny monotone comments that are just comments not funny comments or ones you agree with most of the laughter comes across as sympathy wow this fella is really boring and as funny as my cat eating whiskers i think stewart lee is a total cock unfunny as a dose of the clap and boring as shite and therefore dont watch him he had a go at clarkson for making money off a book he himself makes money off books the comedian had a go at someone else for making money off books and he makes money off books himself he is saying not good for something he does himself  hypocrite an unfunny cock   andyallerton redandwhitekopcom the people who enjoy his comedy also like boring dinner parties socialism even though they are all living the capitalist lifestyle and think nothing at all bringing up the topic of cheese boards into a conversation and make a joke out of it that only they find funny they probably hate country folk that hunt even though they them selves

a torch  a j king amazon my husband is trying to convince me that stewart lee is funny im not convinced  serem twitter i wish that he would show more evidence of the fact that he read english at saint edmonds hall oxford the evidence of this has been carefully sifted out along with his shropshire accent as he has adopted both the speech and cognitive vocabulary and conventions which are the default position of the speakers of estuary english with whom he presumably spends his days during the fist of fun days he made a darkly glamorous if static foil to the far more comedically gifted richard herring but that was then the glamour has long departed  welcome to the club mr lee  and he does not seem to have gained anything in the way of skill from the period working alongside his erstwhile

jerrymorris youtube i think stewart lee has just one problem as a comedian for all his faux intellectual affectations and his penchant for student union politics he just isnt funny i tried hard to like it but it all has a whiff of the emporers new clothes for me he has just about managing to maintain his status to a level where you actually remember who he is since that awful lee and herring thing i guess that as fringe actscelebs who struggle to capture the audience they are clearly desperate for begin to fade their act has to become more shocking to maintain their profile rather than funny  matt york daily mailcouk a two bob unfunny comedian still trying to make it at the edinburgh festival  english cad cad towers dailymailcouk stood behind him in the queue at forbidden planet last year he was reading a poor collection of hellblazer rather than anything substantial and anyone who buys their books at fp is a nobed i was hoping for quality comedy but this stand up was padded out with drivel ie the rapper thing yknow the thing about rappers you know dont you rappers yeah rappers on the bannister rappers they slide along em rappers they do theyre called rappers etc i didnt laugh once despite being ripped to the ts and wanting to find it funny his act really misses herrrings over eager schoolboy to his aloof indie schtick and maybe an editor to tell him this isnt funny go and rewrite it till it is id love to join the stewart lee bandwagon that all the reviewers seem to be on but im going to sit on the sidelines and throw the rotten tomatoes till he starts being funny i too have loved stewart but this seems more like ive met up with him through friends reunited after years apart had one bad shag gone back for another just to find that he was a bad shag first

miserable whiningvoiced cunt bernard manning on the right stewart lee on the left bury them all together dead or alive and leave us with the genuinely funny people  mr dogshit bta i think manning and lee have more in common than most would care to admit even if for some his politics make him almost impossible not to like even when he doesnt crack many genuine funnies if manning lazily picks easy targets then what does lee do in relation to the supposed stupidity of americans implicit  were better than americans  a cheap way to win over an audience and his taking the piss out of other comedians is a bit desperate implicit  im better more intelligent than other comedians  and so are you for coming to see me  and people say hes not smug its this suffocatingly self congratulatory aspect of his comedy which stops me enjoying him alongside the sparsity of genuinely funny stuff  then of course theres the suffocating smugness of his fans were clever like stu not like you oiks laughing at toasters  sam beckett  guardiancouk ive got an english degree and im gonna use it lee reminds me of a passage in frank skinners book when after he graduated he became impossibly pretentious pseud until someone knocked the shit out of him in a pub sadly this has never happened to lee stewart lee is clever not funny stylistically boring  another guardian favorite along with

think im more intelligent than anyone who likes stewart lee because ive realised hes shit  jimthemofo youtube stewart lee has never been funny and never will be the bbc have to name his show a comedy vehicle because you wouldnt be able to tell by the content  hatexfactor guardiancouk i understand his comedy its subtle but malicious mockery of heteronomous individuality and takes the smug autonomous likening towards collectivity as is emphasized by material such as attacking those who do not give to charity and people who dont follow his strict and defined moral codes its bullshit he may have some funny lines observations and wordplay but hes still totally closeminded which only fuels his act a smug git who i cant work out if hes just cornered a market in which id respect him or if he really is that vindictive towards political incorrectness which makes him a twat  baz bonehead youtube he certainly no bernard manning complete and utter shite a smug lefty arse bernard was a genius from the golden age of comedy thats sadly gone now in a time where you cant insult anyone any more you cant even take the piss out of gays now theyre passing a law to make homophobic jokes

gipos and the mexicans is hilarious  sam rooney youtube stewart lee every pseudointellectuals favourite comedian if you dont find him funny its because you cant comprehend his comedic style or youre just not clever enough are usually responses to people who consider him unfunny  cabluigi guardiancouk apart from asher ds book he appeared to have read the first page of chris moyles difficult second book and there was no evidence that he had read anything at all of the others he mentioned clarkson brand brown rowling browns literary construction lends itself to being battered he writes as if his prose is converted from stage directions but lee just made up a line a funny line yes but that doesnt make it intelligent criticism it just makes it a sneery oneliner from a comedian who didnt bother to research his material he didnt actually refer to the content of my booky wook i havent read it either but then im not the one claiming intellectual superiority by dismissing it purely on the basis of its title or the harry potter series or the clarkson books that just leaves the asher d book which he did seem to have read and on which subject he actually was quite intelligent and funny â€“ though the sausageonfork thing was a rather embarrassing lapse into referenceinplaceofactualjoke and the chris moyles book what does lee attack moyles for not his literary construction not his factual veracity not his underlying political leanings but knowing and admitting to his own limitations i dont buy this theory that lees rant is any less reactionary than those of the grumpy old men its sneering posturing made from a position of ignorance aiming at easy targets and missing them he really has become a lazy comedy slag  alex gray offthetellycom intellectual pretensions aside for a moment stewart lee is a bit of a knob sometimes isnt he  contrapuntal twitter this guy is a douche bag who probably drank to much before going on stage to prove what a complete and utter asshole he is

well i was walking down the road pauses and makes a face laughter and i saw a dog pauses and makes a face laughter i think it was a poodle pauses and makes a face laughter maybe a jack russel with curly hair pauses and makes a face laughter i walked past it while looking at it pauses and makes a face laughter you get the picture i hate this  shite painful i started to feel sorry for him worst thing is that he obviously thinks a lot of himself  monkeymonger chrismoylesnet the ira were not british only a tosser would say that the ira were british that is the opinion of a cocky little brit which he so obviously is ive nothing against the british but i dont happen to like cocky wankers as it happens if there was an irishman saying that an english group were irish id call him a dickhead too if lee is into facts as he preaches about in another clip then he should sit down and look at them  instead of talking total shite  wilzer  i must admit i have heard of mr lee having seem two of

true he is a genius i heard him interviewed by clive anderson on a r review programme anderson was enthusiastic about lees recent gigs and upcoming new shows and lee lapped up the attention then anderson brought up a personal attack by lee on fellow funny man russell brand during one of lees stand up shows apparently during this attack lee quoted brand the quote demonstrating that brand is an immoral shitty worthless excuse for a human being and not the intellectually and morally superior experimental kind of individual that lee is unfortunately anderson reveals lee misquoted brand and so changed the entire meaning of what brand had originally said so far so youvenotdoneyourresearch lees true genius shone through moments later though when anderson put it to him that he had deliberately misquoted brand and so was not just a bit lax but actively dishonest well squirmed lee when youre on stageperforming i meanyoure not really being yourself andiwanted to show this by quoting something

supposed to be the thinking mans comedian give me frankie boyle any day  hexedkid youtube there is a disgusting comedy routine by stewart lee in which he slags richard hammond off tells lies about him and says that he hopes that richard dies it certainly is not funny i was at school with both of them and i know why lee is so bitter about richard richard has always been a thoroughly nice chap he is unbelievably kind and always stuck up for people who were being bullied his artistic skills are fantastic and he was always way ahead of everyone else in terms of having a mature outlook however the senior school we went to in  was extremely oldfashioned and had an awful macho culture richard disliked it from the start lee was at least two years older than richard and a typical arrogant poshboy i am certan he never knew richard at all lee always arrogantly thought he was going to be a big star and is now very bitter that an unacademic downtoearth character like richard is a wellloved superstar whilst lee is just treading the comedy circuit thats what happened lee never knew richard and anything lee has said about knowing richard is a almost certainly a complete lie thanks for letting me put

cunt he told one about  jews who were best mates one asks the other what he would do if he won the lottery his mate says well i would share it with you for a start you are my best friend and i would

its irony to bore the audience it wasnt however sycophants in the audience loved it  lunacycle twitter a very annoyed man who craves attention  skpayback youtube is it just me who thinks that stewart lee takes himself too seriously it is as if he has appointed himself mr credibility frankly if you are a comedian i dont care about credibility i just care if you make me laugh and watching your recent bbc  series you didnt do that mr lee in fact you were interminably dull  purewater guradiancouk would rather scoop my eyes out with rusty spoons then watch him again  maxdaman youtube getting a blood transfussion then finding out that due to a mixup you received the blood of an aids ridden junkie is funnier than stewart lee  the iceman dontstartmeoffcom stuart lee is certainly good at being funny in his tubby middle class knowing way but to be fair his robbie williamsesque habitual selfdeprecation stinks of a desperate need to preempt and avoid criticism of any kind and is unfortunate if only he could let it go as is so true with williams and simply let people make their minds up without the immense childlike immaturity of trying to appear so cool about it he would be not only more likeable but just a much better comedian he would have a witty and clever reply even to this though no doubt poor stu  jmr guardiancouk whats happened to stewart lee he was hilarious back in the s now

funny arent intelligent enough to get his humour since when has being smug boring spiteful and not to mention extremely fucking creepy been the height of hilarity they can keep him the weirdo bastards solely put on this earth to condescend the absolute fuck out of anyone thats stupid enough to listen mainly liberals who like him believe their smarter than everyone else i remember seeing this cock on  out  cats once not a great show i know although i quite enjoy watching sean lock on it everytime he spoke he fell flat on his arse it was so amusing watching him be outwitted by the very type of people he regulary deems witless he went on to say that it was one of the lowest points of his career not because he made himself look like a prick oh no but because he wants people to believe hes to good for a show of that nature it pains me to say it bit i think im witnessing someone whos even more undeservedly aggrandized than even bill fucking hicks is hes lucky that theres people stupid enough out there that will settle for someone like him who cannot for the life of him muster up the main ingredient that someone in his position should have the ability to make others laugh instead he gives them nastiness bitterness huge amounts of snobbery and one great big condescension appalling beyond belief ive been unfortunate enough to pay money to watch this talentless buffoon he had this part of his act whereby he held an vinyl record above his head repeating the title the multitude lapped it up as insecure in their intellect as lee himself only a fucking moron would put up with being patronised to fuck by such a unfunny clearly bitter out of date prick such as this s fucking throw back theres no intelligence required for this onslaught of pure cuntishness he tells what he thinks is a joke then has the nerve to turns smugly to his audience and practically ask what type of joke it is and whether its funny again thinking he gets something everyone else doesnt talk about

guardian journalist can relate to smug egotistical and selfcontented  jim guardiancouk i know this guy not well but i can in fact confirm that he is a cock  ive spoken to him several times in the past at various gettogethers although not recently and he is a bit of a pillock he used to go out with my wifes cousin he came up a few times for xmas and one or two other things i found him to be a little condescending and a bit arrogant i think it must be a thing with people who become famous whereby they automatically think they are superior to you just cos theyve been on telly anyway theyve split up now and my wifes cousin seems a lot happier id expect him to keep his standup routine seperate from day to day life but then perhaps im expecting too much i like his comedy but as a person hes a bit of an arse  mrbloefeldt readytogocom you can tell that the laughing is uncomfortable laughing they dont know when to laugh but feel they should he thinks hes clever by explaining his own jokes and how they work other comedians could do the same but realise its lazy and crap but with a coating of stewarts smug veneer it becomes intelligent to his audience cunts sucked into the lee vortex of smug who think lee is some military general of comedy who sets trap that allow him the have the last laugh as victory when in fact hes just exploiting daft selfproclaimed comedy connoisseurs who he knows will like anything thats deemed intellectual no matter how many times he mumbles crisps  otis dontstartmeoffcom ah mr lee is doing postmodernist comedy not only does he tell a joke he then asks the audience whether the joke is funnyoffensiveironicslapstick  or just crap so now standup turns on its head by vilifying the audience for laughingnot laughing at a particular time during the performance

watching stewart lee religiously for a few years but season  of comedy vehicle is awful so far he bounds back and forth between smugly denigrating other more commercial standups and selfindulgently whiningbragging that he isnt himself more popular making ironic jokes about his poor audience and venue i know people will insist he is playing a character here but after dozens of references it comes off as extremely bitter sad and misanthropic his criticisms of modern standup would be valid were it not for the fact that more than half of the material is recycled from his old dvds you cant blast other comedians for a lack of talentimagination and then rely on decadesold tried and tested material half the problem is his unbearable audience insisting on articles like this that he is a thinking mans comedian while lazily bellowing with laughter at each prompted pause in his speech like a bunch of dogs being taught to beg for a treat  bob kennedy guardiancouk he was very disappointing when i

himself go hasnt changed his tone though  mrkingclumsy youtube hes a selfimpressed patronising uphisown arse condescending twat  vagabond btacom stewart lee is bigoted unfunny dick  andy bolton

talking about what he ate for dinner the last week would have been equally giving  tom jones whoateallthepies you know who i cant stand stewart lee  hammondette twitter i do dislike the way that he

minions seem to partake in  paddy h wordmagazinecom without doubt the worlds least funny comedian  pierre  youtube stewart lee you are not funny almost a dane cook level of not funny  may pescante

brazier twitter satire can be funny and funny is something that stewart lee truly aint but im sure he prefers it that way so its fine if youre reading stewart feel free to put that on your next poster  kfed guardiancouk am i the only one who thinks stewart lee is shyte have a feeling a lot of people claim they like him just to be appear highbrow  alan dudmanuk twitter im not defending clarkson and co of anything but at least they arent basing their careers on belittling other individuals doing far better in their chosen career of entertainment i just cant side with a guy who calls himself a politically correct liberal anyone with half a fkn brain cell can understand being politicly correct and a liberal is a conflict of interests if you want funny liberal and relevant comedy i suggest doug stanhope  gonzomouse youtube i thought he was ok when he started but hes a tit now ok imo  tonnyable youtube another marxist idiot who doesnt realize hes the one to be wiped out  linxx youtube stewart lee the uninformed permanent sixthformer rebelling against a society that his ideology has already reduced to ruins and spitting on the remains no faith or belief in or love for anything but himself the true sign of a nation is terminal decline no wonder all the guardian readers love him o tempora o mo yes i am a virus i am the virus that kills socialists  enoch powell   edmund burke lives on guardiancouk thank you for encouraging me to waste half an hour of my lifeit was utterly utterly crap lowlights included the long long riff on travelodges the final punchline being that jokes about travelodges can never be funny â€“ i suppose that a comedian deliberately telling an hackneyed unfunny joke in order to challenge his selfsatisfied audience might be quite amusing in some hands  unfortunately it just made lee look like a smug twat the final apple sketch was i suspect another attempt at subversive comedy by deliberately extending a joke that was barely amusing in the first place into an interminable embarrassingly unfunny sketchshow parody in order to mock the bbc bigwigs who commissioned the show in the first place well done stewart very clever not very funny though  simon c fall forum that waste of apples annoyed me out of all proportion to its likely cost i mean they probably waste more apples than that just in the mouths of the pigs that ornament each of the many bbc staff parties each year but whatever i was like stop ruining those fucking apples you dickwad it honestly spoiled the sketch for me  hoftstadter fall forum i hate to see food going to waste  davey b fall forum looks like a young matt bianco  peas graveny youtube what an unfunny cunt he just isnt funny  hes incredibly dull the problem with stuart lee is that hes a hes not as clever original or interesting as he thinks he is b he just isnt very funny c he wasnt funny to start with anyway just shit what a pretentious wanker sixth form art schooll humour which thinks its more clever than it is shit he keeps doing the same tired sixth form iroinic liberal shite he doesnt even come close to mcintyre in wit entertainment or popularity pleeeeease what he does is basicly sixth form college humour that thinks its alternative clever and a bit on the edgysocial commentary side but its just predicatble and just not funny i think he thinks hes cleverer and more insightful than he actually is very simillar to richard herring and no i dont find al murray roy chubby brown or jim davidson funny either incredibly dull sixth form humour not funny really is he  chrisjoneschrisjones youtube ive given him two chances and fail to see why hes classed as comedy i think im meant to have laughed but didnt if hes trying to shock or offend hes failing at that too its just painfully unfunny i just feel slightly sorry for him  tintin uktvcouk stewart lee your comedy was sharper when you didnt talk about youself so much or how the jokes were going self obsession does not automatically mean intelligent meta comedy gold and it makes you look even more like an ageing morrissey impersonator  faustus kelly guardiancouk i do not think he is as funny as he used to be in the good old days or as funny as that chris moyles from off radio  also i do not trust anyone who still has the same haircut they had in  like mark kermode or morrissey by way of two more quiffular examples  elvis chomsky fall forum god this is just not funny  you have to be naturally funny to be a comedian  not just stand there speaking lines  boygeniuz youtube lee great comedian he has never made me laugh but then i dont find totalitarians funny the joke wears off after the first ten million corpses  joesoap the uklibertariancouk the fall and stewart lee have something in common both are beloved of broadsheet journalists and pseuds on the internet but out in the real world you would be hard pressed to find anyone who was even familiar with their work let alone considers themselves a fan  valten guardiacouk drags out that not routine far too long presumably to fill space in this dead lifeless selfimportant show  daviduk youtube stewart lee isnt even funny hes disgusting and i hope they ban him from performing the only thing funny about him is his looks  hammondx richardhammondnet a fun game to play is spot stewart lee using fancy language incorrectly in a slightly cringeworthy and failed attempt to sound extra clever he does it a fair bit often when he improvises it wouldnt bother me but when his routines and fans make proclamations about how articulate sharp and wellread he is it makes me wince a little  greyztone youtube i dont hate stewart lee but i do hate his fans he has come to represent this kind of smug superiority of the lower middle class with these strawman arguments turned into fairly poor jokes he does seem like a very nice and quite smart guy but there is a reason that only people who are a bit like him like him hes incredibly pedestrian and mediocore  torotrototo guardiancouk personally i find this way too laboured and smug and most importantly not particularly funnny given its his career its natural not clever clever very vogue at the moment with the guardian readers cant do wrong apparently until the next great middle class wannne be different joy thing comes along  johnanthonyp youtube i have just returned from viewing the sensation that is stewart lee now i am being ironic and sarcastic there is nothing sensational about stewart lee the reviews i have read have put him somewhere between a comedy genius and a funny grumpy old man to be honest he isnt and i would advise anyone who isnt a fan to not bother seeing his show on a whim his innane ramblings are neither informed funny ironic or angry everything is forced in his delivery his jokes come at a rate of  every  mins  seconds and even they are only of sniggering quality he specialises in a type of story that apparently reflect his intelligence and wit instead i ended up feeling sorry for his wife and son who have to spend sunday afternoon with someone who thinks they are funny i originally thought i was being obtuse in the first  minutes of the show as a couple of people around me quite literally burst with side splitting laughter to jokes that were so innane i was wondering if i was too stupid to understand then i started to think maybe the manager of the joint had got a stewart lee mask and given it to the stage hand and told him to get out there and do his best due to the inappropriate forced and unfunny delivery very disappointed  dino spoonfedcom i dont think lee could make funny tv even if he let himself be kicked in the balls repeatedly for  minutes  lent percenttv hes as funny as cow sht  jeff faa faa vauxhallownersnetworkcouk reminds me of david brent what a sad middle aged twat   youtube so i was persuaded by someone to go and see stuart lee one half of former comedy duo lee and herring last night but it ended in bitter disappointment so to any scousers that might be tempted into parting with some hardearned i just wanted to know what youd be letting yourselves in for   mbe redandwhitecopcom what is all this buzz about this fat old man i dont think ive ever found a comedian funny from south of derby this jerks frm the fing midlands so he shed have sum northern soul in his set but its like a rant where are the jokes nothing he talking about happen to me ever  cardiffwilly youtube went on too long and his moaning just made him look like a cock yeah used to be funny shouda stuck to radio   fishlick dogsonacidcom stewart lee you poor middle classed idiot what ever to just being yourself without some loser telling you what to say or think if i dont like or agree with well that is just to fing bad so put that in your filthy bong and smoke it no one and i mean has the right to tell me or anyone what to believe or think so cram it with walnuts or if that doesnt do it find another way pc thugs are nazis  thepast youtube lee leaves me completely cold its like watching ernie wise soldiering on decades after the funny one has died or the bass player of a s pop band playing a workingmens club in barnsley lifeaffirming it aint theres more joy in a viz knob gag or five seconds of frankie boyle  yes sir there is a vegetarian option you can fuck off  than a miserable  minutes spent in the company of stewart lee if you have to analyse comedy it aint comedy its not big its not clever and it sure as shit isnt comedy  merperson guardiancouk he came th in the greatest stand ups of all time poll shown on ch the other month yes i know its a fiddle  but still if you went out in the street and asked a hundred people about him youd be hard pressed to find a handful whod even heard of the miserable cnt never mind think he was funny the only few people who even claim to rate him are the usual crowd who think he may in some way be clever and so by claiming to like the unfunny twt somehow raises their own status hs face says it all really  hes got a twat face  voiceofreason totalfootballforumscouk stewart lee funny i must be in a parallel universe ten minutes of last weeks show was enough for me  sansrife guardiancouk spineless liberal faggot  mcbathtub youtube hes not gay hes just british  stud youtube this isnt satire it is shit  rincewind youtube not as clever or as funny as he thinks he is really just smug and elitist with the odd laugh as a byproduct  firetotheworks dooyoucouk people who like stewart lee are arrogant self righteous cunts  wallace youtube stewart lee is not funny fact whether i personally find him funny is neither here nor there i could also say les dennis is unfunny  it might be my opinion but its also more importantly a scientifically proven fact a good indicator of whether something is funny is whther it makes people laugh and considering the paying audience at his shows rarely laugh i think thats a fair indicator that he is not funny i saw his stand up live and you could hear a pin drop he may be clever cutting subtle absurd different etc etcbut hes just not that funny reminds me of a comedian called mark thomas who also forgot to be funny and was more concerned with being intelligent clever and different stewart lee fans dont have a sense of humour case rested stewart lee gives smug tedious people hope that other people find them anything but smug and tedious  hnic guardiancouk who is this old gimmer and what is he blabbering on about he is not funny and he whispers  marshalllucky youtube what an unfunny fuck  biffjohnson youtube its his whole intelligent bullsht that grates on me extending joke after joke to the point of fucking tedium to prove a point  dark soldier forumsnextgenbiz just not half as smart arse and funny as he thinks he is  pretentious guff for white middle aged men frustrated by their lack of achievement   white eyed guardiancouk he is soooooooooooo fucking dull  spr youtube stewart lee is a despicable student union throwback and the idea that anyone would look to him for material is horrifying indeed i saw him live not too long ago and he still had faded black jeans dm shoes and that stupid morrissey quiff like the superannuated indie kid he is  i am nice guardiancouk bernard manning just happened to be well talented and he was not right up his own arsehole like lee is   guest hagen dontstartmeoffcom i took my girlfriend to see stewart perform in cardiff recently she fell asleep  amos the cat guardiancouk stewart lee wasnt funny at all i dont care if his opinion is different from mine when it comes to top gear what im saying is hes a shit comedian who isnt funny because he sucks at being a comedian that is all  teedle youtube hes not my cup of tea either too selfreferential eventually hell disappear up

must be drunk to laugh at him  capitalsho youtube if its true the beatles made the white album because theyll buy anything we make now then its utterly possible stewart lee could make a living standing on stage and reading aloud from the instruction booklet he got with his microphone theyd still be rolloing in the aisles such is the devotion of his devotees  jabjabmove youtube this is not funny and what is he saying  sha youtube shit  sexpistols youtube very vogue at the moment with the guardian readers cant do wrong apparently until the next great middle class wannne be different joy thing comes alongpersonally i find him way too laboured and smug and most importantly not particularly funnny given its his career  jonathanyp youtube ive tried to listen to stewart but because i didnt go to private school  oxford i feel he has a air of superiorty sorry if thats spelt wrong no bodys opion or veiws matter thats what you call a middle class twat  rightwing youtube i saw his shows was described as comedy and it looked like some sort of stand up but i watched it and couldnt for the life of me find the comical part of the show perhaps it was some sort of ironic comedy thats only funny cos its really crap but i just didnt get it  dr boris gobshite totalfootballforumscouk michael mcintyre is funnier the stewart lee cult are driven by nothing but jelousy  rattlesnakemeuk youtube you really call this crap intelligent juvenile adulthumour stupid   finnsia youtube im a comedian and im better than this guy no wonder hes unknown in the uk its just not up to standard  its tired derivative vapid and tedious  come on stewart youve been doing the same routine since   rainbowchild youtube i disagree with stewart lee i believe morality is derived from our evolution so it is fixed  or at least hasnt changed since ancestral times perception of what is morally right may fluctuate throughout our history but i think there is a rational and absolute morality at the core of it  svelter youtube ive always thought of stewart lees comedy as doing the opposite of what really good comedy should do he essentially uses comedy to browbeat people in to agreeing with his rather dogmatic left wing political points of view its as though hes essentially taking what is the sort of prevailing politically correct dogma of his generation and aggressively ridiculing anyone who doesnt sign up to it using comedy as an instrument to enforce conformity not as a means of subversion hes a red faced man jabbing his finger in my face because i dont agree with him he may as well be playing to an empty room for all the concessions he makes to the audience his refusal to concede to the audience is part of an ongoing desire to be taken seriously but someone who wants to be taken so seriously is quite hard to take seriously  toby young a good read bbc radio  march  he seems to have spent an awful lot of time looking for negative comments about himself as hes going through one of his most successful periods in a long time i assume this is a desperate attempt to convince himself that he is still an outsider  danger man cookedandbombedcouk i am a middleaged man and i take my sense of humour very seriously laughter is often the only real let up from embracing my deep disappointment in myself my loved ones and my general situation as a result i feel strongly engaged in the issue of who has the right to be paid to make me laugh even if theyre being paid to make other people laugh even if other people have paid them to make them laugh i feel that as someone who is capable of laughter i am much like a tax payer a stakeholder in the laughter industry and have a burning sense of entitlement to express my opinions on any comedy anywhere i will keep on doing so with more and more rage until i die and no one will have paid attention except other men with slightly differing but no less forcefully expressed resentments and when i die then someone somewhere will be sorry or something  brace guardiancouk haha i do hope hes aware of our site i think it would really get to him if he did hed shit his high almighty y fronts everytime hes charactor got a good kicking on here because its fucking accurate and he knows it the useless cunt  guest dontstartmeoffcom id like to of seen his face the moment the smug little git found us on the google enquiry watch stewart lee

advertisement home» culture» comedy why i walked out of a stewart lee gig stewart lee’s contempt for his audience is becoming a grimly unedifying spectacle says dominic cavendish standup comedian stewart lee  a grim spectacle photo rex by dominic cavendish pm gmt  nov  follow it feels quite empowering to leave a stewart lee gig at the first available opportunity lee’s latest live outing running at leicester square theatre and essentially trialling material ahead of recordings for the new series of his bbc show stewart lee’s comedy vehicle is called much astew about nothing on friday night he was getting much stewed up about his lacklustre audience swiftly discerning that “a lot of you are not my crowd” despite explaining early on that he had no interest in warming us up and just wanted to push through the minute sets the first halfhour or so was beset by his own interruptions as he took issue with our wrongheaded laughs our lack of responsiveness our failure to “make connections” and our want of imagination in coming up with suggestions when asked to do so watch the top comedy podcasts having started off with a theatre full of reasonably cheerful appreciative punters – most of whom looked intelligent enough to me what was he expecting the sort of people who attend a ted conference lee stoked an atmosphere of tension and unease there were early laughs at the expense of that russell brand and jeremy paxman newsnight interview hardly frostnixon “more like a monkey throwing his own excrement against a foghorn” but the contempt he expressed for brand seemed as nothing to the disdain he showed towards those who’d paid to see him “i am not interested in what you think” he advised suddenly “nothing you do tonight will make any difference” he continued in a patronising vein “a lot of the things you hear tonight will relate to things that exist in the real world” what were we he spelt it out with the cword “stupid friday night s” for some reason – too tired too polite too squiffy too adoring – the capacity crowd didn’t mutiny at this sardonic onslaught just took it on the chin in some cases lapped up the abuse with an agreeable chortle was the invective all part of lee’s uncommon cleverness – a windup strategy that allows him to deconstruct his material as he goes along thereby embellishing it further plainly his refusal to suffer perceived fools gladly is of a piece with his highrisk determination not to be crudely “pleasing” but even so the joke wears thin during the edinburgh fringe i turned up to see him perform at the stand in character as “baconface” but he abandoned the gig within about five minutes – our fault apparently not his it’s as though the audience are there for his delectation not the other way round in comedy sometimes a room will turn on a comedian lee reverses that dynamic related articles stop mocking the renowned dan brown  may  has stewart lee changed his tune  nov  top comedians dont write their jokes claims stewart lee  jul  on tour with stewart lee  oct  russell kane smallness  nov  come the interval i decided to take him at his word why stay on and risk letting him down further besides which lee had made it abundantly clear by this point that he didn’t even want a telegraph review he wouldn’t want any telegraph readers in he scoffed in disgust as he vented on the subject of michael deacon “an idiot” apparently whom he accuses of having plagiarised his parody of dan brown as if the da vinci code wasn’t an open invitation to parodists everywhere like a oneman national security agency he monitors deacon’s latenight tweets to pick up references to himself doubtless this piece by me will show up on his google alerts or however he keeps up with the everfascinating subject of how he’s perceived by others maybe i’ll get the honour of being mercilessly dissected online or onstage you know what i don’t give a stuff if lee had a shred of interest or insight into the working lives of other people he’d realise that those who give up an evening at the end of a week to see him deserve his thanks not his toxic scorn picture special tommy cooper  great jokes  follow
