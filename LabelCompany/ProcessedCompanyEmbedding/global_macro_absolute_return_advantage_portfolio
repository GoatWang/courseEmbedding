summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

strategy the fund seeks its investment objective by investing in securities derivatives and other instruments to establish long and short investment exposures around the world total return is defined as income plus capital appreciation it normally invests in multiple countries and frequently has significant exposure to foreign currencies and investments the funds long and short investments primarily are sovereign exposures including currencies interest rates and debt instruments issued or guaranteed by sovereign entities the fund is nondiversified risk lowerquality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer foreign securities are subject to interestrate currencyexchangerate economic and political risks all of which may be magnified in emerging markets in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible may not be suitable for all investors

of the mutual fund read the funds prospectus for more detailed information about the fund additional risk information short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a securitys price increases

stronger european economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets surveys of us consumer and business confidence surged to multiyear highs on expectations that the new administrations

government reported that the pce climbed at an annual pace of  in february — the first time it had exceeded  in nearly five years outside the us the uk economy remained resilient following the june  brexit vote with unemployment falling to its lowest level since  eurozone unemployment also continued to decline and manufacturing activity picked up across the region despite heightened political uncertainty emerging markets experienced robust investor inflows due to several factors including attractive valuations and a weakening in the us dollar in this environment the global equity market registered a strong gain led by emerging markets returns were also positive — albeit more modest — for local currency and us dollardenominated emerging market sovereign debt and for us cre dit the

absolute return fund and eaton vance global macro absolute return advantage fund outperformed their benchmark the bofa merrill lynch  month us treasury bill index the index at net asset value during

sleeve had minimal impact on global macro absolute return fund but was a slight detractor in global macro absolute return advantage fund corporate credit hurt performance for both funds in terms of regions eastern europe was the top contributor to fund performance and western europe was the nextlargest contributor the favorable results in eastern europe were due to currency sovereign credit and rates exposures including long positi ons in the russian ruble and russian rates russias economy has been recovering and inflation has fallen more quickly than expected prompting the central bank to cut interest rates and signal more rate cuts in  long investments in cypriot and turk ish sovereign credit boosted returns in the region as well in western europe a strong gain from long exposure to the icelandic krona versus the euro drove results in the region latin america also positively impacted returns helped by rates and sovereign credit exposures notable contributors included a long rates position in colombia where the central bank eased policy and a long sovereign credit position in brazil where ec onomic improvement led a major ratings agency to raise its credit outlook on the country the dollar bloc added a modest amount of value in global macro absolute return advantage fund however its performance was flat in global macro absolute return fun d within the dollar bloc a long in australian rates was a plus while a short in the canadian dollar detracted asia as well as the middle east and africa region dampened results although rates exposure was positive in asia the

a tourism boom in iceland that is fueling strong ec onomic growth long investments in the russian ruble and turkish sovereign credit were also especially helpful other top contributors included long

in south africa and qatar in addition to short broad european corpora te credit exposure us interestrate duration and nonus interestrate duration were less than one year for global macro absolute
