phase  clinical studies have demonstrated significant ldlc reductions of up to  as monotherapy almost  in combination with ezetimibe and an incremental  on top of any statin at any dose bempedoic acid also consistently lowers high sensitivity creactive protein or hscrp an important marker of the underlying inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease across eighteen completed clinical studies bempedoic acid has displayed consistent and compelling positive clinical results initially we intend to seek approval of bempedoic acid in the us and europe for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd andor heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hefh with elevated levels of ldlc not adequately controlled with current lipidmodifying therapies some patients with elevated ldlc are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant we are confident patients physicians and payers will welcome a convenient complementary costeffective oncedaily oral ldlc lowering therapy especially the estimated  million patients in the us europe and japan who are considered statin intolerant a population with a high level of unmet medical need in europe we are also seeking approval for use of bempedoic acid in statin intolerant patients with elevated ldlc developmentdevelopment pipeline
