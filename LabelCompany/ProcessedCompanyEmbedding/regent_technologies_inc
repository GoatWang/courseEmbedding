consolidated financial statements     note  description of business and significant accounting policies   regent technologies inc formerly regent petroleum corporation was incorporated under the laws of the state of colorado on january   during  the company had reentered the development stage pursuant to asc no  development stage activities asc  of the financial accounting standards codification codification or asc and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles as of january   due to our ongoing oil and natural gas development activities and future plans for exploration and production management has determined that asc no  is no longer applicable and accordingly the asc no  development stage reporting format has been discontinued in this form k references to we our us the company or regent refer to regent technologies inc and regents whollyowned subsidiary regent natural resources co a texas corporation is referred to herein as the subsidiary or regent nrco   the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   the results of operations for the three and six months ended june   should not be considered as indicative of the results to be expected for the full year significant accounting policies are defined as those accounting policies which are most critical to the understanding of a companys financial condition and results of operation we consider an accounting estimate or judgment to be critical if i it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected and could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition a summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied by the company in preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows   consolidation principles   the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this report have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary and include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation certain data in the prior period’s financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the presentation of the current period   estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ materially from those estimates the accounting policies most affected by management’s estimates and assumptions are provisions for depreciation depletion and amortization estimates of proved reserves impairment of longlived assets based on estimates of future net cash flows and asset retirement obligations based on estimates regarding timing and cost of future asset retirements   oil and natural gas properties   the company follows the fullcost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition exploration and development activities are capitalized we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production general corporate overhead or similar activities estimates of our proved reserves as of december   were prepared by a third party engineering firm see note  in our annual report on form k for the year ended december       table of contents   regent technologies inc and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements       proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties in which case a gain or loss is recognized the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties and otherwise if impairment has occurred unevaluated properties are grouped by major prospect area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant we review the carrying value of our properties under the fullcost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test under the ceiling test capitalized costs less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for hedges less estimated future costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves less any related income tax effects   valuation of property and equipment   our longlived assets including proved oil and natural gas properties and equipment are assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred estimates of oil and natural gas reserves by necessity are projections based on geologic and engineering data and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure   estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices future operating costs severance taxes development costs and workover costs all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results for these reasons estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties may vary substantially furniture and equipment are stated at cost   depreciation and depletion of producing oil and natural gas properties are calculated using the unitsofproduction method proved developed reserves are used to compute unit rates for unamortized tangible and intangible development costs and proved reserves are used for unamortized leasehold costs gains and losses on disposals or retirements that are significant or include an entire depreciable or depletable property unit are included in operating income depreciation of furniture fixtures and equipment consisting of office furniture computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements is computed using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives which vary from three to five years   revenue recognition   oil and natural gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and if collectability of the revenue is probable revenues from the production of crude oil and natural gas properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized using the entitlements method differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are routinely adjusted   asset retirement obligation   our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives in accordance with federal state and local laws we account for asset retirement obligations based on the guidance of asc no  asset retirement and environmental obligations asc  which addresses the required accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs asc  requires that the fair value of an assets retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset periodic accretion of the discount of the estimated liability is treated as accretion expense included in depreciation depletion and amortization on our consolidated statements of operations    table of contents   regent technologies inc and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements     income taxes   we utilize the asset and liability method to account for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse   sharebased compensation   we account for equity based compensation under the provisions of asc no  compensation  stock compensation asc  asc  requires the recognition of the fair value of equitybased compensation in operations the fair value of our stock option awards are estimated using a blackscholes option valuation model this model requires the input of subjective assumptions and elections including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award in addition the calculation of equitybased compensation costs requires that we estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited during the vesting period the fair value of equitybased awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we elected to use the straightline method for awards granted after the adoption of asc  with no forfeitures   fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants whether inuse or an inexchange valuation premise the fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance which includes among other things the company’s credit risk in accordance with the requirements of asc no  fair value measurement asc  the company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under asc  and includes this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows     •   level  inputs—unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     •   level  inputs—quotes which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data included in this level are interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our creditworthiness and     •   level  inputs—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability such as discounted cash flow models or valuations based on the company’s various assumptions and future commodity prices included in this level is the carrying value of our investment in macuclear preferred stock see note   none of our investments are held for trading purposes   earnings per common share   earnings per common share are determined under the provisions of asc no  earnings per share asc  which requires the company to report both basic earnings per share which is based on the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share which is based on the weightedaverage number of the common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive shares outstanding at june   there are no exercisable common stock equivalents that are potentially dilutive accordingly no common stock equivalents are included in the earnings per share calculations and basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for all periods presented    table of contents   regent technologies inc and subsidiary notes to consolidated financial statements     recent accounting pronouncements   during the quarter ended june   there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board  fasb each of these pronouncements as applicable has been or will be adopted by the company management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the company’s financial position or operating results the company will monitor these emerging issues to assess any potential future impact on its consolidated financial statements   other accounting policies   the remaining significant accounting policies of the company are described in note  to the consolidated financial statements of the  form k in managements opinion the accounting policies and estimates presented in the  form k have not changed and therefore the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the companys audited financial statements on form k for the year ended december   which was previously filed with the securities and exchange commission   note  going concern uncertainties   as of the date of this quarterly report there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our business operations and material commitments our future success and viability therefore are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing we are optimistic that we will be successful in our new business operations and capital raising efforts however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating revenue or raising additional capital the failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon the company and our shareholders these consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements   note  private placement memorandum   effective september   the company approved a private placement memorandum “ppm” to raise  through the issuance of  shares of series a  convertible preferred stock at  per share the “offering” under the ppm the company is selling full units for

provide financial advisory services to the company on an exclusive basis to assist with the company’s needs for equity and debt capital for several projects under evaluation the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement on november   to acquire certain oil and gas assets in ohio pennsylvania and new york which agreement was terminated on december   due to the seller’s inability to satisfy certain conditions precedent to closing the company is continuing to negotiate the acquisition and has advanced  toward environmental engineering and bank fees related thereto   our strategic imperatives include     • selectively pursuing strategic partnerships with industry partners that may expand or complement our energy technology development operations   • focusing on reservoirs with known hydrocarbon production primarily in conventional shallow lowcost permeable carbonate reservoirs with decades of production history   • entering into joint ventures with oil and natural gas operators who have extensive experience and expertise in the areas selected for exploration to allow us to obtain working interests in a number of prospects with minimal overhead   currently we have leasehold rights in two areas of oil and gas activity in texas   south texas eagle ford shale trend   we have acquired participation rights in prospects in the austin chalk the eagle ford shale the buda lime and the pearsall shale these are considered the primary targets in the stacked oil and gas plays of south texas in april  we negotiated a thirdparty exploratory agreement and earned a  carried working interest in the first five wells drilled on  gross acres in zavala county texas we have the right but not the obligation to continue as a  working interest participant after our carried interest the participating interest is in all wells drilled and completed for all strategraphic horizons below the anacacho formation   drilling was initiated for the first well on april   to test the buda limestone through an underbalanced horizontal procedure the drilling of the first well has been finalized and the stimulation program is being developed for completion during the third quarter drilling for the second well was initiated on june   as a vertical well with plans to stimulate and produce the eagle ford shale and the buda limestone formations the drilling has been finalized for the second well and core samples are being evaluated for the development of the stimulation program the  acre leasehold has proved producing oil and gas reserves below the anacacho formation from the eagle ford shale and buda limestone and is prospective for the austin chalk and pearsall shale formations   east texas faultline fields   during the second quarter we performed a geological and geophysical evaluation of our properties in hill county texas we engaged lgt corporation to analyze the current productive fields and possible extensions related to our leaseholds the results reflect several drillable woodbine and austin chalk formation anomalies determined utilizing gravity and magnetic mapping near surface fault expressions and the area mineralization and thermal analyses based on seepage models based on the success of the analysis we initiated activity for the resumption of production from our current wells we own interests in  producing wells and one injection well the wells were placed back in production in july  following a series of tests and stimulation treatments the wells are currently shutin waiting maintenance to the injection well
