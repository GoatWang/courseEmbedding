investment since going public or being sold ranking also depends on a venture capitalists or lawyers bankers or recruiters length of involvement and influence with a startup companies must have gone public or been acquired after june  to be considered and they must be engaged in information technology or life sciences our results are based on extensive reporting and surveys sent to  professionals

dado banatao was friends with steve jobs back in the day when silicon valley was just a “bunch of orchards” “in the really really early stages of personal computers there were a lot of tinkerers and engineers who wanted to build these computers themselves at home so it was more like a hobby” in person he is an extremely simple man unassuming clad in a basic buttondown polo and dark trousers with how low key he is you would hardly be able to tell that he is a billionaire visionary based in silicon valley he shies away and politely begs off talking about net worth and material assets and instead lights up and laughs a lot when talking about his work he is responsible for consumerizing a specific technology used exclusively back then by the us military and today we have it on our phones and cars and we call it gps according to morphlabs ceo and cofounder winston damarillo  percent of every computer and laptop in existence carries technology and ideas developed by this man here are  things you should know about dado banatao   he who is known as the “father of the semiconductor” and “filipino bill gates” he is not so fond of the latter is the son of a farmer from iguig cagayan and used to walk a dirt road to school every day he went on to study in ateneo de tuguegarao mapua then stanford  his father first worked as a farmer then left for guam to become an ofw when dado was around nine years old he recalls that he was probably too young for it to affect him and all he knew was that his father was not there all the time but that he would come home once a year his favorite pasalubong “rubber shoes that was fun” he graduated valedictorian from elementary school he left their barrio to go to tuguegarao to attend high school where he lived in a boarding house on weekdays and went home on weekends “it was a little room with a basic bed and little table and that’s where i studied every night when i was done i’d go to bed it was such a simple life” dado was very driven at an early age studying reading and doing his homework on his own even if nobody was watching over him he loved and excelled in algebra trigonometry and physics which prompted his dean to advise him become an engineer he then moved to manila and lived with his aunt and graduated cum laude with a degree in electrical engineering from mapua  “i’ve always been inclined to learn more i felt that my training in college was not sufficient” dado explains while working in the us he was accepted in a graduate study program where he could work full time and earn a salary but at the same time study at the university of washington at the expense of the company “i saved for my eventual expense when i went to stanford” he says he was not on any scholarship at stanford instead he saved up and paid for his own master’s degree in electrical engineering and computer science and finished in less than two years  unlike the young less fortunate pinoys today who say they study or work hard to get themselves “out of poverty” dado’s motivation to excel in school was different “we had no notion of wealth we didn’t even know there was such a thing as a wealthy person we studied because our parents told us it was important” lifestyle feature  article mrec  pagematch  sectionmatch dado and maria met through common friends in seattle he recalls how she asked him one day if he had a savings account and when he said he didn’t she actually opened one for him which forced him to save many years later he started his own companies that did very well and eventually ended up selling some reportedly one for a  million and another for over a billion dollars  dado’s childhood wish was to become a pilot in his early s he was hired as a design engineer for the development of the boeing  as fate would have it today he is able to fly his own plane “i was literally  years old when i got my engineering degree and at that age i was looking for something more interesting i had high expectations” dado shares he says he was offered a couple of jobs after college but he found them boring “i didn’t see myself doing it every day” and he was actually discouraged until he saw this advertisement for philippine airlines saying they were looking for pilot trainees they were  in their batch at the pal aviation school and after a yearlong training he was offered a job at boeing he took the job and moved to seattle “they were in the final stage of integration and a lot of systems have already been designed but there was quite a lot of work left” dado recalls he says that there were a few other filipinos working on the  but it was his team that was in charge of finalizing design control surfaces and engine systems indication to name a few there was grand event for the boeing  launch and dado shares “to see it do its first flight was amazing you cannot imagine such a big airplane lift up it was very inspiring” he says that the event was very exciting but that he found his work there to be boring “so i went to graduate school”  fast forward to when he was  and dado still cannot believe he was able to buy his first plane he begs off answering specific details but says that they’re used for family trips and important business matters when i asked what it felt like when he flew his own plane for the first time he smiles from ear to ear like a child playing with his favorite toy and says “it was awesome”  he decided to base himself in silicon valley at a time it wasn’t even called silicon valley yet that was in the early ‘s and dado was  “it was just a bunch of orchards back then” he recalls smiling he says that most engineers had no idea it would explode in  years the way silicon valley is today he saw some established companies that were already doing the things he liked to do plus he was very comfortable there which is what sealed the deal for him to live in the area “in my graduate program i combined solid state circuits and computer architecture what it means really is the idea of putting a computer in a chip” he explains he was interviewed and was offered a job at intel american microsystems and national semiconductors the only companies that were doing dado’s vision of putting the knowledge of software and hardware together and he chose national semiconductors because he felt they had the best program the banatao family come together for the first holy communion of one of the apos he often says that if silicon valley were a country it’d be top  in the world in terms of gdp which is why he highly encourages the philippines to invest more in math and science in schools and in research and technology because he believes it is a great step towards national development   dado was friends with steve jobs they were both part of a small group called the homebrew computer club “in the really really early stages of personal computers there were a lot of tinkerers and engineers who wanted to build these computers themselves at home so it was more like a hobby” he says of their club he says steve wozniak of apple was “a true engineer a real techie” and that steve jobs’ strength was “how to apply things better and his designs reflected that” he shares that the company he was working with back then created their own personal computer and that for a good three to four years in the mid ‘s they were outselling the apple computer “we had the same ideas and a lot of those we were talking about it in the club” he fondly recalls “i can still imagine those evenings where one guy would bring his program and say ‘hey see what i can do here’ and another would go ‘no i can do better’ and it was that kind of club we were daring each other” when i joked if he considers himself more of a nerd or a geek he says “you start out as a nerd then you become a geek by that time i was already a geek” he laughs  dado banatao in numbers  grade of his glasses for his right eye his left eye is   centavos in pesos it cost him to buy a small bowl of pancit for lunch back in college to get to school he took a bus then a jeepney to his campus in doroteo jose   around the age he experienced celebrating his birthday for the first time and he doesn’t really think it was a celebration it was just a get together with friends and someone brought bibingka “growing up we didn’t celebrate birthdays the way we’d celebrate is we would go to church that day it was so basic” today he and his family never fail to celebrate a birthday but dado says its still a very simple celebration  number of scholarships to be given away to filipino science or engineering students this year by the superfund project each scholar gets a total of p for five years unknown the number of cars he owns “i like cars” he says with a shy smile  on what for him is his most significant invention “let’s not use the word invention for me innovation is more important than invention” “when scientists or engineers invent things there must be millions of those around the world but we never know of them because it deals only with one little thing unless you mix other things to it it is not useful” dado explains he says that in innovation you take many concepts and put them together with a specific application and market already in mind “what i did at stanford became very important because i combined computer science and solid state devices” he says according to him the trick was keeping the system the same but throwing away all the useless things “i found a way and realized how it can be redesigned properly” dado’s childhood wish was to become a pilot in his early s he was hired as a design engineer for the development of the boeing  as fate would have it today he is able to fly his own plane  after  years as an employee he started his own companies that did very well and eventually ended up selling some reportedly one for a  million and another for over a billion dollars dado went from individual contributor to first level manager to manager of an entire operation in his early years as an employee in silicon valley “those are all confidence building events that made me think i can do really challenging things and deliver the product i think most entrepreneurs go through that process” he shares his first start up company mostron was put up with  pooled together from friends and founders of the group they developed a pc motherboard that unfortunately was not so successful “i felt really bad because that was my idea but all the customers wanted to buy were the chips that i designed” dado reveals”i learned a lot from there” with the same idea from his first startup with adjustments made and with someone investing a million dollars in his idea dado put up his second startup company with a former boss of his chips and technology he basically designed the very first chip set for the pc “it enabled a lot of engineers who wanted to design the pc system to come up with their own design because we took care of the nittygritty for compatibility” he shares the company grew very very fast and from the time they started it they took it public in  months and in four years the revenue was  million  s was as the name implies his third start up company “i was very disappointed with the graphics performance of the pc it was very slow” he recalls after setting up a meeting with microsoft and a separate meeting with intel to pitch his idea he started his redesign of the chip he needed to make the computer run faster the technical term is “bus” borrowing from the concept of an actual bus because it is a collection of signals and data being shipped from one place to another “today that bus is called pci and it is everywhere companies use it now as a standard bus” in  he was given the master entrepreneur of the year award sponsored by ernst and young inc magazine and merrill lynch business financial services  he met his wife maria when he was  years old and they’ve been together ever since he is now  dado and maria met through common friends in seattle and after dating for a few months they went “exclusive” he recalls how she asked him one day if he has a savings account and when he said he didn’t she actually opened an account for him which forced him to save that and this forced savings program at boeing were what made him afford his tuition at stanford while he was in california for his master’s she was taking up her master’s in education at the university of washington since it was a long distance relationship they had this strategy to save money “instead of calling each other we had a code of number of rings on the phone i had a roommate back then and i had to tell him to not pick up the phone right away he was laughing at me” he did get to visit her during christmas and spring break on which he took eighthour drives just to see her they got married in  and today they are fulfilled parents to three children and even happier grandparents to six grandchildren with another one due in august when i asked him what the one most important thing he wants his kids and grandkids to value he says “education”  the mobile phone he uses today has been his phone for the past  years a “really old” motorola razr “there’s a new one but that’s a smart phone i have the really old model” he says smiling he has no favorite gadgets but has an ipad a pc laptop and a mac laptop “i hardly use these things frankly apparently i stay away from them” he reveals when i tell him how people myself included would think that he would have the most hightech phones and gadgets considering he is the authority on technological advancements all he could do was smile and shrug his elbows “i’m not into gadgets the closest thing i guess its more of what i drive and what i fly” he then smiles that shy smile once again   today both his business and advocacy are geared towards helping young students and entrepreneurs who are set on making their mark in the field of science and engineering  because he
