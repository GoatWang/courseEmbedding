regions with high temperature gradients between surface and m depth otec diagram and applications ocean thermal energy conversion otec uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface seawaters to run a heat engine and produce useful work usually in the form of electricity otec can operate with a very high capacity factor and so can operate in base load mode among ocean energy sources otec is one of the continuously available renewable energy resources that could contribute to baseload power supply the resource potential for otec is considered to be much larger than for other ocean energy forms world energy council  up to  twhyr of power could be generated from otec without affecting the ocean’s thermal structure pelc and fujita  systems may be either closedcycle or opencycle closedcycle otec uses working fluids that are typically thought of as refrigerants such as ammonia or ra these fluids have low boiling points and are therefore suitable for powering the system’s generator to generate electricity the most commonly used heat cycle for otec to date is the rankine cycle using a lowpressure turbine opencycle engines use vapour from the seawater itself as the working fluid otec can also supply quantities of cold water as a byproduct this can be used for air conditioning and refrigeration and the nutrientrich deep ocean water can feed biological technologies another byproduct is fresh water distilled from the sea otec theory was first developed in the s and the first bench size demonstration model was constructed in  currently the

develop and refine otec technology started in the s in  jacques arsene darsonval a french physicist proposed tapping the thermal energy of the ocean darsonvals student georges claude built the first otec plant in matanzas cuba in  the system generated  kw of electricity with a lowpressure turbine the plant was later destroyed in a storm in  claude constructed a plant aboard a ton cargo vessel moored off the coast of brazil weather and waves destroyed it before it could generate net power net power is the amount of power generated after subtracting power needed to run the system in  french scientists designed a  mw plant for abidjan ivory coast the plant was never completed because new finds of large amounts of cheap petroleum made it uneconomical in  j hilbert anderson and james h anderson jr focused on increasing component efficiency they patented their new closed cycle design in  this design improved upon the original closedcycle rankine system and included this in an outline for a plant that would produce power at lower cost than oil or coal at the time however their research garnered little attention since coal and nuclear were considered the future of energy japan is a major contributor to the development of otec technology beginning in  the tokyo electric power company successfully built and deployed a  kw closedcycle otec plant on the island of nauru the plant became operational on  october  producing about  kw of electricity  kw was used to power the plant and the remaining electricity was used to power a school and other places this set a world record for power output from an otec system where the power was sent to a real as opposed to an experimental power grid  also saw a major development in otec technology when russian engineer dr alexander kalina used a mixture of ammonia and water to produce electricity this new ammoniawater mixture greatly improved the efficiency of the power cycle in  saga university designed and constructed a  kw plant for the purpose of testing a newly invented uehara cycle also named after its inventor haruo uehara this cycle included absorption and extraction processes that allow this system to outperform the kalina cycle by  currently the institute of ocean energy saga university is the leader in otec power plant research and also focuses on many of the technologys secondary benefits the s saw an uptick in otec research and development during the post  arabisraeli war which caused oil prices to triple the us federal government poured  million into otec research after president carter signed a law that committed the us to a production goal of  mw of electricity from otec systems by  view of a land based otec facility at keahole point on the kona coast of hawaii in  the us established the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority nelha at keahole point on the kona coast of hawaii hawaii is the best us otec location due to its warm surface water access to very deep very cold water and high electricity costs the laboratory has become a leading test facility for otec technology in the same year lockheed received a grant from the us national science foundation to study otec this eventually led to an effort by lockheed the us navy makai ocean engineering dillingham construction and other firms to build the worlds first and only netpower producing otec plant dubbed miniotec for three months in  a small amount of electricity was generated research related to making opencycle otec a reality began earnestly in  at the solar energy research institute seri with funding from the us department of energy evaporators and suitably configured directcontact condensers were developed and patented by seri see  an original design for a powerproducing experiment then called the kw experiment was described by kreith and bharathan  and   as the max jacob memorial award lecture the initial design used two parallel axial turbines using last stage rotors taken from large steam turbines later a team led by dr bharathan at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel developed the initial conceptual design for updated  kw opencycle otec experiment  this design integrated all components of the cycle namely the evaporator condenser and the turbine into one single vacuum vessel with the turbine mounted on top to prevent any potential for water to reach it the vessel was made of concrete as the first process vacuum vessel of its kind attempts to make all components using lowcost plastic material could not be fully achieved as some conservatism was required for the turbine and the vacuum pumps developed as the first of their kind later dr bharathan worked with a team of engineers at the pacific institute for high technology research pichtr to further pursue this design through preliminary and final stages it was renamed the net power producing experiment nppe and was constructed at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii nelh by pichtr by a team led by chief engineer don evans and the project was managed by dr luis vega india – pipes used for otec left and floating otec plant constructed in  right in  india tested a  mw floating otec pilot plant near tamil nadu the plant was ultimately unsuccessful due to a failure of the deep sea cold water pipe its government continues to sponsor research in  makai ocean engineering was awarded a contract from the us office of naval research onr to investigate the potential for otec to produce nationallysignificant quantities of hydrogen in atsea floating plants located in warm tropical waters realizing the need for larger partners to actually commercialize otec makai approached lockheed martin to renew their previous relationship and determine if the time was ready for otec and so in  lockheed martin resumed work in otec and became a subcontractor to makai to support their sbir which was followed by other subsequent collaborations in march  ocean thermal energy corporation signed an energy services agreement esa with the baha mar resort nassau bahamas for the worlds first and largest seawater air conditioning swac system in june  the project was put on pause while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues in august  it was announced that the issues had been resolved and that the resort would open in march  it is expected that the swac systems construction will resume at that time in july  makai ocean engineering completed the design and construction of an otec heat exchanger test facility at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii the purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for otec heat exchangers increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost heat exchangers being the  cost driver for an otec plant and in march  makai announced an award to install and operate a  kilowatt turbine on the otec heat exchanger test facility and once again connect otec power to the grid in july  the virgin islands public services commission approved ocean thermal energy corporations application to become a qualified facility the company is thus permitted to begin negotiations with the virgin islands water and power authority wapa for a power purchase agreement ppa pertaining to an ocean thermal energy conversion otec plant on the island of st croix this would be the worlds first commercial otec plant currently operating otec plantsedit in march  saga university with various japanese industries completed the installation of a new otec plant okinawa prefecture announced the start of the otec operation testing at kume island on april   the main aim is to prove the validity of computer models and demonstrate otec to the public the testing and research will be conducted with the support of saga university until the end of fy  ihi plant construction co ltd yokogawa electric corporation and xenesys inc were entrusted with constructing the  kilowatt class plant within the grounds of the okinawa prefecture deep sea water research center the location was specifically chosen in order to utilize existing deep seawater and surface seawater intake pipes installed for the research center in  the pipe is used for the intake of deep sea water for research fishery and agricultural use the plant consists of two kw units in double rankine configuration the otec facility and deep seawater research center are open to free public tours by appointment in english and japanese currently this is one of only two fully operational otec plants in the world this plant operates continuously when specific tests are not underway in  makai ocean engineering completed a heat exchanger test facility at nelha used to test a variety of heat exchange technologies for use in otec makai has received funding to install a  kw turbine installation will make this facility the largest operational otec facility though the record for largest power will remain with the open cycle plant also developed in hawaii in july  dcns group partnered with akuo energy announced ner  funding for their nemo project if successful the mw gross mw net offshore plant will be the largest otec facility to date dcns plans to have nemo operational by  an ocean thermal energy conversion power plant built by makai ocean engineering went operational in hawaii in august   the governor of hawaii david ige flipped the switch to activate the plant this is the first true closedcycle ocean thermal energy conversion otec plant to be connected to a us electrical grid  it is a demo plant capable of generating  kilowatts enough to power about  homes otec projects around the world thermodynamic efficiencyedit a heat engine gives greater efficiency when run with a large temperature difference in the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the tropics although still a modest  to  °c it is therefore in the tropics that otec offers the greatest possibilities otec has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are  to  times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave powercitation needed otec plants can operate continuously providing a base load supply for an electrical power generation system the main technical challenge of otec is to generate significant amounts of power efficiently from small temperature differences it is still considered an emerging technology early otec systems were  to  percent thermally efficient well below the theoretical maximum  and  percent for this temperature difference modern designs allow performance approaching the theoretical maximum carnot efficiency cycle typesedit cold seawater is an integral part of each of the three types of otec systems closedcycle opencycle and hybrid to operate the cold seawater must be brought to the surface the primary approaches are active pumping and desalination desalinating seawater near the sea floor lowers its density which causes it to rise to the surface the alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costscitation needed closededit diagram of a closed cycle otec plant closedcycle systems use fluid with a low boiling point such as ammonia having a boiling point around  °c at atmospheric pressure to power a turbine to generate electricity warm surface seawater is pumped through a heat exchanger to vaporize the fluid the expanding vapor turns the turbogenerator cold water pumped through a second heat exchanger condenses the vapor into a liquid which is then recycled through the system in  the natural energy laboratory and several privatesector partners developed the mini otec experiment which achieved the first successful atsea production of net electrical power from closedcycle otec the mini otec vessel was moored  miles  km off the hawaiian coast and produced enough net electricity to illuminate the ships light bulbs and run its computers and television openedit diagram of an open cycle otec plant opencycle otec uses warm surface water directly to make electricity the warm seawater is first pumped into a lowpressure container which causes it to boil in some schemes the expanding vapour drives a lowpressure turbine attached to an electrical generator the vapour which has left its salt and other contaminants in the lowpressure container is pure fresh water it is condensed into a liquid by exposure to cold temperatures from deepocean water this method produces desalinized fresh water suitable for drinking water irrigation or aquaculture in other schemes the rising vapour is used in a gas lift technique of lifting water to significant heights depending on the embodiment such vapour lift pump techniques generate power from a hydroelectric turbine either before or after the pump is used in  the solar energy research institute now known as the national renewable energy laboratory developed a verticalspout evaporator to convert warm seawater into lowpressure steam for opencycle plants conversion efficiencies were as high as  for seawatertosteam conversion overall steam production would only be a few percent of the incoming water in may  an opencycle otec plant at keahole point hawaii produced close to  kw of electricity during a net powerproducing experiment this broke the record of  kw set by a japanese system in  hybridedit a hybrid cycle combines the features of the closed and opencycle systems in a hybrid warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flashevaporated similar to the opencycle evaporation process the steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closedcycle loop on the other side of an ammonia vaporizer the vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity the steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water see heat pipecitation needed working fluidsedit a popular choice of working fluid is ammonia which has superior transport properties easy availability and low cost ammonia however is toxic and flammable fluorinated carbons such as cfcs and hcfcs are not toxic or flammable but they contribute to ozone layer depletion hydrocarbons too are good candidates but they are highly flammable in addition this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels the power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid with increasing vapor pressure the size of the turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side land shelf and floating sitesedit otec has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power and in conjunction with electrolysis could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumptioncitation needed reducing costs remains an unsolved challenge however otec plants require a long large diameter intake pipe which is submerged a kilometer or more into the oceans depths to bring cold water to the surface landbasededit landbased and nearshore facilities offer three main advantages over those located in deep water plants constructed on or near land do not require sophisticated mooring lengthy power cables or the more extensive maintenance associated with openocean environments they can be installed in sheltered areas so that they are relatively safe from storms and heavy seas electricity desalinated water and cold nutrientrich seawater could be transmitted from nearshore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways in addition landbased or nearshore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water favored locations include those with narrow shelves volcanic islands steep  degrees offshore slopes and relatively smooth sea floors these sites minimize the length of the intake pipe a landbased plant could be built well inland from the shore offering more protection from storms or on the beach where the pipes would be shorter in either case easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs landbased or nearshore sites can also support mariculture or chilled water agriculture tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers to monitor and control miniature marine environments mariculture products can be delivered to market via standard transport one disadvantage of landbased facilities arises from the turbulent wave action in the surf zone otec discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas also the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater may need to be carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance one way that otec systems can avoid some of the problems and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from  to  meters deep ocean thermal corporation  this type of plant would use shorter and therefore less costly intake and discharge pipes which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf the plant itself however would require protection from the marine environment such as breakwaters and erosionresistant foundations and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore shelf basededit to avoid the turbulent surf zone as well as to move closer to the coldwater resource otec plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to  meters  ft a shelfmounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea bottom this type of construction is already used for offshore oil rigs the complexities of operating an otec plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than landbased approaches problems include the stress of openocean conditions and more difficult product delivery addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable base power delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land for these reasons shelfmounted plants are less attractivecitation needed floatingedit floating otec facilities operate offshore although potentially optimal for large systems floating facilities present several difficulties the difficulty of mooring plants in very deep water complicates power delivery cables attached to floating platforms are more susceptible to damage especially during storms cables at depths greater than  meters are difficult to maintain and repair riser cables which connect the sea bed and the plant need to be constructed to resist entanglementcitation needed as with shelfmounted plants floating plants need a stable base for continuous operation major storms and heavy seas can break the vertically suspended coldwater pipe and interrupt warm water intake as well to help prevent these problems pipes can be made of flexible polyethylene attached to the bottom of the platform and gimballed with joints or collars pipes may need to be uncoupled from the plant to prevent storm damage as an alternative to a warmwater pipe surface water can be drawn directly into the platform however it is necessary to prevent the intake flow from being damaged or interrupted during violent motions caused by heavy seascitation needed connecting a floating plant to power delivery cables requires the plant to remain relatively stationary mooring is an acceptable method but current mooring technology is limited to depths of about  meters  ft even at shallower depths the cost of mooring may be prohibitivecitation needed some proposed projectsedit otec projects under consideration include a small plant for the us navy base on the british overseas territory island of diego garcia in the indian ocean ocean thermal energy corporation formerly ocees international inc is working with the us navy on a design for a proposed mw otec plant to replace the current diesel generators the otec

designed the world’s largest seawater air conditioning swac plant for a resort in the bahamas which will use cold deep seawater as a method of airconditioning in mid the complete project was temporarily put on hold while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues in august   the government of the bahamas announced that a new agreement had been signed under which the baha mar resort will be completed on september   bahamian prime minister perry christie announced that construction had resumed on baha mar and that the resort was slated to open in march  ote expects to have the swac plant up and running within two years of baha mars opening hawaiiedit lockheed martins alternative energy development team has partnered with makai ocean engineering to complete the final design phase of a mw closed cycle otec pilot system which planned to become operational in hawaii in the  time frame this system was designed to expand to mw commercial systems in the near future in november  the us naval facilities engineering command navfac awarded lockheed martin a us million contract modification to develop critical system components and designs for the plant adding to the   million contract and two department of energy grants totaling over  million in  and march  a small but operational ocean thermal energy conversion otec plant was inaugurated in hawaii in august  the opening of the research and development kilowatt facility marked the first time a closedcycle otec plant was connected to the us grid hainanedit on april   lockheed contracted with the reignwood group to build a  megawatt plant off the coast of southern china to provide power for a planned resort on hainan island a plant of that size would power several thousand homes the reignwood group acquired opus offshore in  which forms its reignwood ocean engineering division which also is engaged in development of deepwater drilling japanedit currently the only continuously operating otec system is located in okinawa prefecture japan the governmental support local community support and advanced research carried out by saga university were key for the contractors ihi plant construction co ltd yokogawa electric corporation and xenesys inc to succeed with this project work is being conducted to develop a mw facility on kume island requiring new pipelines in july  more than  members formed the global ocean resource and energy association gosea an international organization formed to promote the development of the kumejima model and work towards the installation of larger deep seawater pipelines and a mw otec facility the companies involved in the current otec projects along with other interested parties have developed plans for offshore otec systems as well  for more details see currently operating otec plants above united states virgin islandsedit on march   ocean thermal energy corporation otec and the th legislature of the united states virgin islands usvi signed a memorandum of understanding to move forward with a study to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits to the usvi of installing onshore ocean thermal energy conversion otec renewable energy power plants and seawater air conditioning swac facilities the benefits to be assessed in the usvi study include both the baseload  clean electricity generated by otec as well as the various related products associated with otec and swac including abundant fresh drinking water energysaving air conditioning sustainable aquaculture and mariculture and agricultural enhancement projects for the islands of st thomas and st croix the honorable shawnmichael malone president of the usvi senate commented on his signing of the memorandum of understanding mou authorizing otes feasibility study “the most fundamental duty of government is to protect the health and welfare of its citizens said senator malone these clean energy technologies have the potential to improve the air quality and environment for our residents and to provide the foundation for meaningful economic development therefore it is our duty as elected representatives to explore the feasibility and possible benefits of otec and swac for the people of usvi” on july   otes application to be a qualifying facility was approved by the virgin islands public services commission ote also received permission to begin negotiating contracts associated with this project kiribatiedit south koreas research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso received approval in principal from bureau veritas for their mw

their nemo new energy for martinique and overseas project which is expected to be a mwnet offshore facility completed in  the award to help with development totaled  million euro related activitiesedit otec has uses other than power production desalinationedit desalinated water can be produced in open or hybridcycle plants using surface condensers to turn evaporated seawater into potable water system analysis indicates that a megawatt plant could produce about  cubic metres  cu ft of desalinated water each day another system patented by richard bailey creates condensate water by regulating deep ocean water flow through surface condensers correlating with fluctuating dewpoint temperatures this condensation system uses no incremental energy and has no moving parts on march   saga university opened a flashtype desalination demonstration facility on kumejima this satellite of their institute of ocean energy uses postotec deep seawater from the okinawa otec demonstration facility and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water air is extracted from the closed system with a vacuum pump when raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed the steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold postotec deep seawater the desalinated water can be used in hydrogen production or drinking water if minerals are added air conditioningedit the  °f  °c cold seawater made available by an otec system creates an opportunity to provide large amounts of cooling to industries and homes near the plant the water can be used in chilledwater coils to provide airconditioning for buildings it is estimated that a pipe  foot  m in diameter can deliver  gallons of water per minute water at  °f  °c could provide more than enough airconditioning for a large building operating  hours per year in lieu of electrical conditioning selling for ¢ per kilowatthour it would save  in energy bills annually the intercontinental resort and thalassospa on the island of bora bora uses an swac system to aircondition its buildings the system passes seawater through a heat exchanger where it cools freshwater in a closed loop system this freshwater is then pumped to buildings and directly cools the air in  copenhagen energy opened a district cooling plant in copenhagen denmark the plant delivers cold seawater to commercial and industrial buildings and has reduced electricity consumption by  percent ocean thermal energy corporation ote has designed a ton sdc system for a vacation resort in the bahamas chilledsoil agricultureedit otec technology supports chilledsoil agriculture when cold seawater flows through underground pipes it chills the surrounding soil the temperature difference between roots in the cool soil and leaves in the warm air allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics dr john p craven dr jack davidson and richard bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority nelha the research facility demonstrated that more than  different crops can be grown using this system many normally could not survive in hawaii or at keahole pointcitation needed japan has also been researching agricultural uses of deep sea water since  at the okinawa deep sea water research institute on kume island the kume island facilities use regular water cooled by deep sea water in a heat exchanger run through pipes in the ground to cool soil their techniques have developed an important resource for the island community as they now produce spinach a winter vegetable commercially year round an expansion of the deep seawater agriculture facility was completed by kumejima town next to the otec demonstration facility in  the new facility is for researching the economic practicality of chilledsoil agriculture on a larger scale aquacultureedit aquaculture is the bestknown byproduct because it reduces the financial and energy costs of pumping large volumes of water from the deep ocean deep ocean water contains high concentrations of essential nutrients that are depleted in surface waters due to biological consumption this artificial upwelling mimics the natural upwellings that are responsible for fertilizing and supporting the worlds largest marine ecosystems and the largest densities of life on the planet coldwater delicacies such as salmon and lobster thrive in this nutrientrich deep seawater microalgae such as spirulina

can be produced via electrolysis using otec electricity generated steam with electrolyte compounds added to improve efficiency is a relatively pure medium for hydrogen production otec can be scaled to generate large quantities of hydrogen the main challenge is cost relative to other energy sources and fuels mineral extractionedit the ocean contains  trace elements in salts and other forms and dissolved in solution in the past most economic analyses concluded that mining the ocean for trace elements would be unprofitable in part because of the energy required to pump the water mining generally targets minerals that occur in high concentrations and can be extracted easily such as magnesium with otec plants supplying water the only cost is for extractioncitation needed the japanese investigated the possibility of extracting uranium and found developments in other technologies especially materials sciences were improving the prospectscitation needed political concernsedit because otec facilities are moreorless stationary surface platforms their exact location and legal status may be affected by the united nations convention on the law of the sea treaty unclos this treaty grants coastal nations  and nauticalmile  km zones of varying legal authority from land creating potential conflicts and regulatory barriers otec plants and similar structures would be considered artificial islands under the treaty giving them no independent legal status otec plants could be perceived as either a threat or potential partner to fisheries or to seabed mining operations controlled by the international seabed authority cost and economicsedit for otec to be viable as a power source the technology must have tax and subsidy treatment similar to competing energy sources because otec systems have not yet been widely deployed cost estimates are uncertain one study estimates power generation costs as low as us  per kilowatthour compared with    for subsidized wind systems beneficial factors that should be taken into account include otecs lack of waste products and fuel consumption the area in which it is availablecitation needed often within ° of the equator the geopolitical effects of petroleum dependence compatibility with alternate forms of ocean power such as wave energy tidal energy and methane hydrates and supplemental uses for the seawater thermodynamicsedit a rigorous treatment of otec reveals that a  °c temperature difference will provide as much energy as a hydroelectric plant with  m head for the same volume of water flow the low temperature difference means that water volumes must be very large to extract useful amounts of heat a mw power plant would be expected to pump on the order of  million gallons  metric tonnes per minute for comparison pumps must move a mass of water greater than the weight of the battleship bismark which weighed  metric tons every minute this makes pumping a substantial parasitic drain on energy production in otec systems with one lockheed design consuming  mw in pumping costs for every  mw net electricity generated for otec schemes using heat exchangers to handle this volume of water the exchangers need to be enormous compared to those used in conventional thermal power generation plants making them one of the most critical components due to their impact on overall efficiency a  mw otec power plant would require  exchangers each larger than a foot shipping container making them the single most expensive component variation of ocean temperature with depthedit the total

jeremy feakins group executive chairman ceo edward baer director cfo treasurer james greenberg director head of communications  and the rest of the team  frank dicola director gerald koenig gc head of government affairs ted johnson senior vp head of otec steven oney chief science advisor andrew welch vp of project management doug schultz finance director cb panchal senior technical consultant natalie baer program development manager interview what is ocean thermal energy conversion otec ocean thermal energy conversion otec is a way of generating clean baseload  renewable energy without the use of fossil fuels by using the temperature differential between warm ocean surface water and cold deep water typically in the subtropical and tropical regions of the world httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvemlblawhsfeaturesharelistuuytqkktslurachra how does otec work in a closed cycle otec system two large pipes draw water from the ocean a warm water pipe containing the surface water which is heated by the sun everyday and a cold deep water pipe containing the chilly water from near the ocean floor the heat from the surface water is used to boil a working fluid with a low boiling point such as ammonia creating steam which turns a turbine generator to produce electricity the chill from the cold deep water is then used to condense the steam back into liquid form allowing the system to continuously repeat this process fueled by the sun’s daily heating of the surface water is otec a proven technology yes over  million has previously been spent in research  development to prove otec mostly by the united states department of energy in the s with that doe funding a landbased demonstration otec plant was successfully operated in a series of trials from  proving that otec can produce clean baseload  electricity without the use of fossil fuels that successful demonstration plant was built and operated on the big island of hawaii at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority nelha today at that nehla site the deep cold water pipes are still operational having withstood category iv hurricane earthquake and numerous tropical storms and have given rise to thriving businesses including multiple water bottling plants as well as sustainable fishfarming httpwwwnelhaorgtenantscommercialhtml how is otec different than other renewable energies in two ways first while current renewable technologies such as solar and wind have an important role to play in the future of global energy supply they are intermittent unlike otec which is baseload providing a constant  supply of energy wind and solar obviously work only when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining otec on the other hand works  and will continue to do so for as long as the sun heats the surface waters of the world’s tropical and subtropical oceans every day with the global population growing exponentially and industrializing more baseload energy is essential to meet those needs second and equally important otec is much bigger than just baseload renewable energy it can also be used to produce great volumes of potable water and sustainable fishfarming thus otec’s unique package of energy water and food…the basic necessities for all humans… means otec can provide communities around the world with sustainable independence based upon their most abundant local resource the ocean if otec was proven  years ago and can provide all of these amazing benefits why hasnt otec is now ready for large scale commercial development as a result of  changing factors in the last  years first technical advances in the offshore oil industry many of which are applicable to deep cold water pipe technology for otec mean small mw landbased otec plants can now be built with offtheshelf components with minimal technologyengineering risks for plant construction and operation in fact the authoritative us government agency noaa issued a  report concluding that using a single cold water pipe cwp a mw otec plant is now “technically feasible using current design manufacturing deployment techniques and materials” second high oil prices have made otec electricity pricing increasingly competitive particularly in many tropical and subtropical locations where electricity prices based almost entirely on imported fossil fuels are now in the exorbitant range of  centskwh in addition to providing cheaper and more reliable energy ote offers its customers long term energy contracts with pricing caps this eliminates exposure to the volatility of rising oil prices which are threatening to cripple many economies particularly given tumultuous events in the middle east raising the likelihood of spiking oil prices what is seawater district cooling sdc in conjunction with ote’s business model of building owning and operating otec plants globally ote will also build own and operate seawater district cooling sdc systems which use cold deep ocean water as the nonpolluting refrigerant for large scale air conditioning needs such as resorts and hotels in nonscientific terms an sdc plant might be thought of as “half an otec plant”…meaning that while an otec plant has two pipes one warm water pipe and one cold water pipe an sdc plant has only one pipe…the cold water pipe which brings up the chilly deep ocean water this cold deep water is used as the nonpolluting refrigerant for airconditioning reducing electricity usage by  when compared to conventional ac…saving the typical customer millions of dollars in electricity bills over the contract’s life how much global consumer demand is there for sdc and otec rapidly increasing global energy demand and steadily climbing energy prices combined with ocean thermal energy corporation’s worldleadership position in otec and sdc explain why ote now has multiple projects in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans with executed agreements ranging from an energy services agreement to various signed memoranda of understanding to move forward with  separate projects and advancing discussion with numerous other major potential customers all of these projects are in accordance with ote’s essential business model to build own and operate otec and sdc facilities across the globe many otec and sdc customers worldwide have expressed to ote a sense of urgency to engage ote to help them immediately move away from fossil fuel dependency particularly in light of tumultuous events in the middle east which threaten spiking oil prices in the words of one energy minister expressed directly to ote executives “please help free my country from the tyranny of oil” and another utility top executive remarked “if oil goes back to  per barrel and stays there for any sustained period it will spell economic catastrophe for this community” reflecting this strong sentiment many governments around the world have committed to significantly increasing the production of renewable energy including by mandated goals given the huge economic incentives for sdc customers this global market is itself an immense international market which helps to diversify any otecrelated business risks in light of the fact that there are currently operational and commercial sdc facilities around the world moreover ote has found that an sdc project can be an excellent entrée into the otec markets in many locations does ote corp have the team  resources to successfully build  operate otec and sdc yes with its stellar technical team and unique ip position ote operates as the brains behind otec and sdc locationspecific designs engaging worldclass epcs large construction contractors such as dco energy us and dcns paris france to build sdc and otec plants to otes specifications ote has assembled an experienced management and advisory team together with worldclass technology and engineering partners ote’s team includes both dr ted johnson formerly director of lockheed martin’s ocean energy division with an annual turnover of hundreds of millions of dollars where he focused on otec and dr stephen oney who worked as part of the group conducting r  d leading to the successful hawaii landbased demonstration otec plant in the s this impressive team has attracted steadfast support from highstature leaders on ote’s advisory board including ed rendell former governor of pennsylvania roy bernardi former acting hud secretary for president george w bush chris carney former pennsylvania congressman  homeland security member dr howard hanson scientific director se national marine renewable energy center and bill roberts former legislative director environmental defense fund what are the limitations of otec the primary limitation of otec is geographic this technology is ideally suited for tropical and subtropical regions of the world where more than  billion people live however in some circumstances otec may use wasteheat to operate outside of these regions what are the environmental risks of otec there are two potential environmental impacts of otec both of which are easily addressable first in order to maintain the balance of the ocean ecosystem in areas where otec is used the water taken from the ocean into the otec plant must be returned to the ocean at a depth and temperature near the ambient temperature this concern can be readily addressed it is important to bear in mind that otec does not involve the release of any pollutants into the ocean the system merely harvests ocean water and returns the water from where it came the second concern is for the risk of marine life becoming trapped in the piping system while this risk is virtually nonexistent for the cold water pipe resting on concrete collars on the seabed where there is minimal marine life the risk is much more pronounced regarding the warm water pipe this risk is also readily remedied by ◦adequate meshingscreening mitigating any possible damage to aquatic life and reducing the chance of secondary damage to the food chain ◦appropriately slow flow rates of the water enabling marine life to avoid even nearing the screening though the above two environmental concerns can be readily addressed based upon ote’s extensive technical research and commitment to responsible stewardship it is nonetheless important to stress that ote’s conclusions are strongly supported by the fact that otec has received considerable support in the environmental protection community one case in point a recent report by henry curtis executive director of life of the land a leading nonprofit environmental advocacy group in hawaii the report is entitled life of the lands energy independence for hawaii  an integrated approach to economic revitalization in a culturally and environmentally sensitive way the report’s executive summary states that with this document life of the land lays out a plan where each island would be  energy selfreliant by  the chief baseload energy would be ocean thermal energy conversion otec” equally compelling is the fact ocean thermal energy corporation has attracted many stalwart environmental advocates including advisory board member bill roberts former legislative director environmental defense fund what is the size of the market for ocean thermal energy data from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel website wwwnrelgov indicates that at least  countries and  territories are potential candidates for otec power systems escalating fuel prices and an unstable market for oil has prompted many nations and states to look at renewable energy solutions often by legislative mandate there is an estimated  terrawatts of potential otec net power production available worldwide the estimated otec market size for tropical and subtropical regions is expected to generate almost us trillion in revenues over the next  years according to the nrel what experience does the ote team have with otec ote personnel participated in otec research and development at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority httpwwwnelhaorg where the us department of energy supported a landbased otec experimental facility operating from  the plant produced net power proving that otec could provide viable clean energy without the use of fossil fuels meanwhile dr ted johnson our senior vice president and head of otec programs was previously a year veteran of lockheed martin corporation where he directed the ocean energy division that built ‘miniotec’ the first net powerproducing floating otec system what are ote corporations business goals in the next  years our goal is to sign energy agreements to build own and operate  otecsdc systems worldwide generating an estimated us billion in revenue over the life of those contracts while improving the lives of millions of people worldwide what is ote corporations competitive advantage ote is the only company to have developed land and ocean based otec power and water production cycles for the us government and whose personnel have the handson experience of helping to develop proprietary technology our experience allows us to design build and deploy systems that are more efficient and much less costly to construct and operate only a small handful of potential competitors have the financial ability to develop the technical expertise to enter otec development and production with lockheed martin lm the most prominent of them all however lm is a technology company not an independent power producer ipp like ote and has no plans to enter the ipp field meanwhile otec international llc abell foundation makai engineering hawaii xenesys inc japan do not have the handson otec experience and knowledge ote possesses and are years away from deployment in  lm subcontracted to ote’s subsidiary for technical expertise related to otec work what level of technological knowhow does ote corporation have over twentyfive years of experience with otec systems has provided us with unrivaled knowhow and understanding of the technologies needed for optimum designs and most advantageous economics of these systems teaming with world class engineering procurement and construction epc companies and project financing partners ote designs builds and operates commercially ready costeffective scalable power producing otec and sdc systems with no emissions and fixed energy pricing that offers the customer outstanding longterm energy cost savings our technologies are suitable for deployment in parts of the world where we can alleviate expensive electricity prices a lack of drinkable water and a
