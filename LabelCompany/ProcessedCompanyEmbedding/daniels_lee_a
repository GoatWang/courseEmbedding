critically acclaimed  hit monsters ball was not only an oscar winner but turned a  million production into a  million successearly lifefilm producer director born december   in philadelphia pennsylvania lee daniels is known for his uncompromising work producing films that tackle such thorny issues as race image family violence and sex along the way hes shown that these stories can have success at the box office his critically acclaimed  hit monsters ball was not only an oscar winner but turned a  million production into a  million success daniels was born far away from the glitz and glamour of hollywood the oldest of five children born to clara and william daniels lee daniels grew up in west philadelphia his dad a cop who had once worked as a bodyguard for muhammad ali and was killed in a robbery when his oldest boy was just  could be hard on his children especially daniels whose early signs of his homosexuality didnt exactly sit well with him but beyond the physical abuse william daniels sometimes brought to the household there was another side to him one that centered on a deep appreciation for books and poetry he had a passion for reading and wrote his own short stories and poetry anything artistic i got i got from him daniels has said despite the obvious strain william daniels placed on his relationship with his children lee daniels says he clearly loved his dad and his shocking death was difficult to overcome much less understandcareer in healthcareafter high school daniels headed off to st louis missouri to attend the small liberal arts school lindenwood college he wanted to study theater and film but it wasnt long before he grew frustrated with academics just before the start of his junior year dropped out he packed up his things again and with just  in his pocket a lot of ambition moved to los angeles to make it as a writer he didnt have much luck finding work in hollywood however instead to make ends meet daniels took a job as a receptionist at a nursing agency within a short time daniels was part of management then started his own nursing agency out of his home it wasnt what daniels had moved out to hollywood to do but soon his fiveperson nursing staff had grown to  and he was heading up a company worth several million dollars as it would be with his later film work there was a bit of a pioneering spirit behind daniels healthcare career in addition to working with the american heart  lung associations and the american sickle cell anemia association his company became the first of its kind in the country to land a contract with the aids project los angelesmaking it in hollywoodbut daniels hadnt completely abandoned his dream of working in hollywood by chance a client of his was also a producer who had worked with prince the two got to talking one saturday morning and when daniels told him what his real career ambitions were the producer told him he could help him find a job and so at the age of  daniels sold his agency pocketed several million dollars and started a new career as a production assistant his focus soon became casting and he eventually found himself working on bigname projects likeunder the cherry moon and purple rain in  daniels frustrated by the lack of meaty roles available to proven africanamerican actors yet again showed his ambition and drive by striking out on his own he formed lee daniels entertainment a new york citybased management company whose clients would eventually include some of the biggest names in hollywood from cuba gooding jr and hilary swank to morgan freeman and marianne jeanbaptiste daniels foray into moviemaking with the creation of monsters ball came about after several conversations with sean penn about the film the story which is centered on a complicated biracial romance had seen more than a few stops and starts as different directors—first penn and later oliver stone—tried to make a movie out of it fascinated by the tale and frustrated at all the obstacles daniels took control of the project himself he turned to swissborn director marc foster to lead the movie and convinced enough alist talent—halle berry and bill bob thornton among others—to do the film for little money the result was an unabashed success getting a best writing nomination at the  academy awards and making berry the first africanamerican woman to win a best actress oscar in addition the movie made daniels the first africanamerican to solely produce an academy awardnominated filmmainstream successdaniels wasted little time basking in the accolades in  he produced his next film the woodsman a haunting tale about the tormented life of a child molester who was released from prison the film starring kevin bacon kyra sedgwick and mos def earned more acclaim and more awards for daniels two years later audiences got a chance to see the result of daniels directorial work with the release of shadowboxer starring helen mirren cuba gooding jr monique stephen dorff vanessa ferlito joseph gordonlevitt and macy gray the film tells the tale of a mother and her stepson who are also assassins as it has been with much of his work daniels personal biography factored into his initial attraction to the story shadowboxer was based on my life daniels told the times i knew killers my uncle who took care of me murdered people and yet he took care of me too people who have gone to jail for murder are also humanpreciousdaniels followedup the crtically acclaimed film with precious the  movie based on the novel push by sapphire the novel recounts the story of an overweight africanamerican girl and her attempts to break free from the violence that has shaped her life ally sheedys mother gave me the book to read daniels recalled it blew me away it rocked my soul it stuck me to like hot grits but the author at first wouldnt give me the rights to the book i kept stalking her and she finally gave me the book the film which costars mariah carey and monique was hardly a cookiecutter operation because of the physical proportions demanded of the lead character daniels and his team had to look beyond hollywood and most conventional casting methods to find a pound africanamerican woman to play claireece precious jones they eventually found their woman in gabourey sidibe a new york city resident who had no prior acting experience even then however the movie was far from an easy production daniels who both produced and directed the film fired staff on a few occasions the film budget also dried up at one point daniels had carey give a private concert at his house to raise money from a group of prospective investors the film was eventually finished and the end product has only enhanced daniels stardom at sundance precious earned three awards including the grand jury prize and also took home the peoples choice award at the toronto film festival the events highest honor with success has come criticism and daniels movies have drawn concern and sometimes ire from film critics about his portrayal of africanamerican characters precious is no exception in the film the lead character contracts aids from her father which serves to only reinforce certain stereotypes critics counter about the black community and black women in general daniels doesnt see it that way black women are dying because everyone wants to pretend to have a certain image he told reporters shortly after the movies release in the fall of  most of the aids patients in this country are black women for me to portray and not tell my truth and bring it to the screen would be an injustice to me as a man—forget about a black man but as a man i would be lying and black women are dyingrecent projects and personal lifeall of which points to how daniels has been careful to leverage his celebrity and power for causes he believes in in  for example he teamed up with former president clinton on a series of public service productions to encourage young africanamericans to vote daniels has continued to make engaging and challenging films in  he directed the paperboy with zac efron and nicole kidman the movie gained some notoriety for a risque scene featuring its two lead actors daniels then created a truly american epic with the butler  which looks a series of presidents through the people who served them the starstudded cast includes forest whitaker and oprah winfrey made for less than  million the butler has brought in more than  million domestically there is also substantial buzz around the film and its performances about possible academy award nominations for his next project daniels wanted to tackle the life of rock legend janis joplin as he told the hollywood reporter i had no idea janis joplin was so smart—intellectual even look some of the smartest people in the world have been drug addicts amy adams stars as the late singer daniels is confident that adams has the vocal talent to pull off such a challenging role while his janis joplin project ran into some delays daniels found time to create a hit television series he is the cocreator of empire a drama that looks the family involved with a successful music company daniels has also written and directed some of the shows episodes in the series terrence howard plays lucious lyon head of the music label and the family he must decide who will take over his business

grit and grime he endured on his comeup while also exploring race in a way we havent seen before by latoya cross january   comments empire cocreator lee daniels lee daniels wanted to shakeup network television “i think we’ve gotten too politically correct with primetime we’re just not in your face anymore you can go to cable for that” he tells ebonycom while on the set of his second fox series star daniels has an anxious demeanor and it’s obvious that the writer producer and director has onethousand thoughts floating through his mind as he skips from one idea to the next but even with the immediate success of empire and the risks taken that led to its gaspworthy moments daniels is nervous about the reception of what he’s bringing to viewers next “do you think people are going to like it” he asks in a slight whisper referencing star a drama based in atlanta and centering on three aspiring singers “i really want to explore race in a way that we haven’t seen it before on a network series” and he does–in a sense daniels’ exploration of race in a “new light” is bringing the lead character of star a white girl jude demorest into a black environment and observing what that’s like on a national viewing scale his reasoning goes a bit more indepth however “we are in a very dangerous state right now in our country and i wanted white people to feel good about being white because right now there’s a lot of hatred going on” daniels explains before further detailing the story he created “it started out with this white girl that was just badass and would do anything kill rob have sex whatever to get to the top then i realized as i was writing that it was more about a girl group their whole world is about what happened to me when i left home and went to hollywood and the struggles i went through ” star demorest and simone brittany o’grady are sisters who were separated and entered into the foster care system after their mother’s death alexandra’s ryan destiny life experience is the total opposite of her singing counterparts she’s the daughter of a rockstar lenny kravitz flaunting luxurious style with an attitude to match on the upper east side of new york city who’s running from her father’s wealth she links with the sisters in hopes of finding her identity and building a music career the series which aired as a special presentation back in december touches on the foster care system prejudices within the black community and enters the world of the transgender community via the storyline of amiyah scott who plays “cotton” the daughter of carlotta played by queen latifah “i think empire has paved a way for me to bust open the door with this transgender issue that even i don’t understand and i’m gay” daniels says he takes a deep breath as he recalls a dark scene in the first episode that shows cotton being attacked in an alley “i was just trying to tell the truth and figure out how i do i tell this story and the pain of what she’s had to go through to become her from a very young age it makes my trashcan story look like disneyland” he says referencing an early episode of empire star packs on the grit and hustle while weaving in spiritual elements too we meet carlotta a beauty shop owner that very much becomes its own character in the drama at church leading the choir as she belts out “i’ve been way too low for way too long” carlotta speaks with intent but it’s her eyes that do most of the talking it’s evident that she’s been through the rough and is working constantly to stay out of it though she’s cotton’s mother when star simone and alexandria step foot in her church carlotta’s nurturing and protective instincts are kicked up to a higher degree “it’s always a tricky line between carlotta and those three girls cotton’s ass is slick too” latifah says “i think one of the best things about carlotta is that she has a lot of baggage and it’s not current she’s a constant work in progress she’s ‘bout it bout it’ but she’s really trying to stay on the right side of things but she’s always prepared you know what i mean” many have likened the show to a spinoff of empire the common denominators are indeed music and drama but escapism serves as an undertone of the new series and “rich” is only an idea in the lives of all characters involved “this is some other type of sh–” daniels laughs season  of star kicks

rockstar lenny kravitz flaunting luxurious style with an attitude to match on the upper east side of new york city who’s running from her father’s wealth she links with the sisters in hopes of finding her identity and building a music career the series which aired as a special presentation back in december touches on the foster care system prejudices within the black community and enters the world of the transgender community via the storyline of amiyah scott who plays “cotton” the daughter of carlotta played by queen latifah “i think empire has paved a way for me to bust open the door with this transgender issue that even i don’t understand and i’m gay” daniels says he takes a deep breath as he recalls a dark scene in the first episode that shows cotton being attacked in an alley “i was just trying to tell the truth and figure out how i do i tell this story and the pain of what she’s had to go through to become her from a very young age it makes my trashcan story look like disneyland” he says referencing an early episode of empire star packs on the grit and hustle while weaving in spiritual elements too we meet carlotta a beauty shop owner that very much becomes its own character in the drama at church leading the choir as she belts out “i’ve been way too low for way too long” carlotta speaks with intent but it’s her eyes that do most of the talking it’s evident that she’s been through the rough and is working constantly to stay out of it though she’s cotton’s mother when star simone and alexandria step foot in her church carlotta’s nurturing and protective instincts are kicked up to a higher degree “it’s always a tricky line between carlotta and those three girls cotton’s ass is slick too” latifah says “i think one of the best things about carlotta is that she has a lot of baggage and it’s not current she’s a constant work in progress she’s ‘bout it bout it’ but she’s really trying to stay on the right side of things but she’s always prepared you know what i mean” many have likened the show to a spinoff of empire the common denominators are indeed music and drama but escapism serves as an undertone of the new series and “rich” is only an idea in the lives of all characters involved “this is some other type of sh–” daniels laughs season  of star kicks off tonight c on fox   latoya “toi” cross is the senior editor of entertainment and

international business skill  synthesis objective    aacsb  analytical thinking    what is the difference between relativism and normativism how do these concepts relate to ethical behavior in international business answer  relativism affirms that ethical truths depend on the groups holding them this makes intervention by outsiders unethical the idea of relativism can be expressed by the statement “when in rome do as the romans do” normativism holds that there are universal standards of behavior based on people’s own values that all cultures should follow making nonintervention unethical managers thus struggle with implementing a “universal” set of truths versus adapting to local conditions on the assumption that every place is different and should be treated differently often a company faces certain pressures to comply with local norms these may take the form of laws that permit—or even require—only certain practices that grant competitive advantages to firms accepting local norms while throwing up roadblocks in front of companies that try to impose homecountry practices in the local arena conversely firms may face certain pressures not to comply from its homecountry government or even from constituencies that threaten retaliatory action if it submits to objectionable foreign practices diff  learning outcome  discuss the role of ethics and social responsibility in international business skill  synthesis objective    aacsb  ethical understanding and reasoning    explain why the argument that “anything that is legal is ethical” is insufficient answer the law is not appropriate for regulating all business activity because not everything that is unethical is illegal the law is slow to develop in emerging areas of concern laws take time to be legislated and tested in courts further they cannot anticipate all future ethical dilemmas basically they are a reaction to issues that have already surfaced the law often is based on moral concepts that are not precisely defined and that cannot be separated from legal concepts moral concepts must be considered along with legal ones the law is often in need of testing by the courts this is especially true of case law in which the courts establish precedent the law is not very efficient efficiency in this case implies achieving ethical behavior at a very low cost and it would be impossible to solve every ethical behavioral problem with a law diff  skill  critical thinking objective   aacsb  ethical understanding and reasoning    what is extraterritoriality why is the concept controversial answer  extraterritoriality takes place when governments apply their laws to the foreign operations of their domestic companies laws vary from country to country often because moral values vary from country to country what some countries accept as illegal may not be considered as such by other countries strong governments can attempt to enforce their laws on their domestic companies operating in other countries this has become very controversial and as argued by some inconsistent with increased globalization and the need to collaborate across national boundaries diff  skill  critical thinking objective   aacsb  reflective thinking    what types of payments are legal and illegal under the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa of the united states provide an example answer  payments to officials to expedite otherwise legitimate transactions officially called “facilitation payments” but sometimes referred to as “speed money” or “grease money” are legal but payments to other officials who are not directly responsible for carrying out the transaction are not facilitation payments take many forms for example payment to a customs official to clear legitimate merchandise is legal whereas a payment to a government minister to influence the customs official is illegal the fcpa allows the former payment because governmental officials in many countries delay compliance of laws indefinitely until they do receive payments even though such payments may be illegal in those countries diff  learning outcome  discuss the role of ethics and social

among international businesses answer  the fcpa outlaws bribery payments by us firms to foreign officials political parties political officials and political candidates according to the act it is illegal to make payments to government officials to directly engage in illegal activity to benefit the briber however it is possible for us companies to make facilitating payments to foreign government officials to expedite legitimate transactions in other words doing what they should be doing not doing something wrong the fcpa is directed toward us companies operating abroad although the provisions of the fcpa were extended in  to include bribery by foreign firms operating in the united states or one of its territories the us government and other governments worldwide are starting to crack down harder on bribery governments want to ensure that individual and corporate behavior are consistent with the best interest of the broader community and also want to be sure that laws are

working hours and freedom of association these issues are especially critical in retail clothing footwear and agriculture where mnes outsource production to independent companies abroad usually in developing countries the challenge for mnes is that they work in an environment with different cultural legal and political rules than what they are used to in their home countries the objective of eti is to get companies to adopt ethical employment policies and then monitor compliance with their overseas suppliers eti’s trading initiative base code identifies the following issues employment is

international business skill  critical thinking objective   aacsb  ethical understanding and reasoning    what motivations do companies have to act responsibly how can codes of conduct help firms to act ethically answer unethical and irresponsible behavior could result in legal sanctions especially in the areas of bribery and product safety unethical and irresponsible behavior could also result in consumer boycotts unethical behavior can affect employee morale good behavior can positively influence both the workers in the developing countries as well as those in corporate headquarters back home who are proud of their company’s behavior companies never know when bad publicity is going to cost them sales a major component of most companies’ strategies for ethical and socially responsible behavior is a code of conduct external codes of conduct are useful only insofar as they give companies some general guidance on how to operate the practical challenge for the company is familiarizing itself with the codes of many different organizations and using them to fashion its own internal code of conduct a code of conduct that is clearly communicated to all employees suppliers and subcontractors should provide global policies that help guide decisions diff  learning outcome  discuss the role of ethics and social responsibility in international business skill  synthesis objective    aacsb  analytical thinking    how have sustainability demands and the kyoto protocol affected international business discuss the controversies surrounding each answer  sustainability refers to the concept of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs proponents of the concept argue that sustainability considers what’s best for both people and the environment however the concept is controversial because sustainability can be interpreted differently by environmentalists and businesspeople the kyoto protocol which requires the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases has not been adopted by all countries and is therefore still limited in its total global impact however companies must adapt to countries that have implemented the protocol countries that have not signed the kyoto protocol argue that the mandatory restrictions may reduce economic growth diff  skill  synthesis objective    aacsb  analytical thinking    how can an mne operating in a developing country have a positive influence on labor policies illustrate your answer with an example answer  mnes operating in countries with very different labor policies succumb to the pressure to simply leave the market usually this turns out to be a shortsighted decision research shows for instance that companies like nike have substantially improved the conditions of workers in overseas facilities granted mnes are in no position to revolutionize the employment practices of the countries in which they operate but they can improve conditions at subcontract facilities and even influence the guidelines set by other foreign investors in the case of ikea carpets make up a small percentage of sales and it would have been easy to simply give up the product line and move out of india but officials at ikea felt a responsibility to the children and decided to do as much as possible to make a difference as ikea got more involved in india it set up the ikea foundation and partnered with unicef contributing over  million in cash and inkind donations to unicef programs to help children and their families ikea’s work with unicef went beyond the issues of the supply chain and moved more into the humanitarian aspect of how to help the children the ikea foundation targets south asia especially india because of its supply chain issues but it also targets that region because of the tremendous need that exists to help the children diff  learning outcome  discuss the role of ethics and social responsibility in
