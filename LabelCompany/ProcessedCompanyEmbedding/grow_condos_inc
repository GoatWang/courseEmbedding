developments of last year and ambitious goalsetting for the year ahead i am pleased to say that  was a year of transformation and tremendous progress for the company in our last quarter in terms of

highly lucrative industry for our shareholders partners and associates we look forward to  and  to be key years in the developing of grow condos in an industry leader in the specialty of real estate tools and education for the marijuana industry industry outlook the legal marijuana industry has never looked better with many experts already labeling it as the fastest growing industry in the country and if the trend toward legalization spreads to all  states marijuana could become larger than the organic food industry industry experts estimate us market for legal cannabis grew  percent in  to  billion up from  billion in  additionally over the next five years the marijuana industry is expected to continue to grow with an estimated  more states will legalize recreational marijuana and two more states will legalize medical marijuana it is estimated by the arcview group publisher of the rd edition of the state of legal marijuana markets that by  all of the statelegal marijuana markets combined will make for a potential overall market worth almost  billion annually california still has the largest legal medical cannabis market in the us at  billion arizona was found to have the fastestgrowing major marijuana market in  expanding to  million up more than  million from the previous year medical marijuana is already legal in arizona and california and recreational legalization measures are likely to appear on the  ballots in both states more than  million shoppers purchased legal marijuana from a dispensary either medical or recreational in  five states now boast marijuana markets that are larger than  million and in colorado and washington — the first states to open retail marijuana shops in the us — consumers bought  million in marijuana products last year oregon and alaska are expected to add a combined  million in retail marijuana sales in their first year of operation the report projects the huge growth potential of the industry appears to be limited only by the possibility of states rejecting the loosening of their drug laws if the legalization trend continues to the point that all  states legalize recreational marijuana the total market value of all states legalizing marijuana would top  billion — more than  billion larger than the organic food industry significant achievements   recapitalize the company’s stock and positioning for
