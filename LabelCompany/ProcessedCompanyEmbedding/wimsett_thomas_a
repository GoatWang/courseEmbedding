few months ago my wife and i sold our business we were at the time using npc and tom wimsett ceo  president  for our credit card processing we followed the proper guidlines to cancel our service with them using a letter in writing and contacting the regional manager mark who was the regional manager advised me that everything was okwell my wife and i had a seperate business account after the sale of the business which only had about  in it we never really checked the account due to the fact is was just there for emergency money if needed we didnt have any atm cards or withdrawal slips so we assumed the money was just collecting interest well  year goes by and we get a overdraft fee in the mail from natinal bank of omaha stating that npc tom wimsett ceo  president  has exhausted our funds and we are now negative  in our account and we need to deposit money to bring it up to a zero balance we were appalled but we had to do it so that our credit wasnt destroyedi contacted tom wimsett ceo  president  and spoke to several people explaining i cancelled over a year ago and we didnt use their services they said they never recieved the letter i said well i sent it to the regional manager they said he is no longer with us so i said fine it is my fault for not being aware of my bank account for  year ill eat the  a month you charged me for  months as well as the  annual fee and they charged me  for pci fee well i said how do i cancel to make sure that i am not charged again they said to send us a fax stating you dont want to use our services any longer tom wimsett ceo  president   the crazy thing about the pci fee is that we never got any service for it and never signd up for it i think this was just a made up fee when i called tom wimsett ceo  president he said this was a insurence program for credit card numbers and thatvisa and master card made the program and i said that i did not have any numbers and that i did not need it but they charged me anyway i did this and then  weeks later i get another overdraft fee from bank of america stating i am  negative tom wimsett ceo  president  charged me a  cancellation fee and then bak of america charged me  in overdraft fees i contacted natinal bank of omaha and their so called fraud dept and they told me there is nothing they can dostay far far far away from this merchant company they will rip you off this report

does your business have a bad reputation fix it the right way corporate advocacy program™ seo reputation management at its best this company enrages me i have had my account closed with them for more than three months however charges continue to be automatically withdrawn from the checking account that was associated with npcnet and tom wimsettthere has been more than  withdrawn in unauthorized transactions everytime i call the company  tom wimsett continues to assure me that nothing else will be withdrawn and that i will be reimbursed for the money they have taken however nothing has been reimbursedtoday was the last straw  tom wimsett withdrew  from my personal checking account unauthorized after i called them today and was assured no further charges would be takenwhen you call the number given on the statements and on the website it says that you are talking to a third party who can do nothing when you actually get a hold of a real person at npc they direct me to the person i supposedly need to talk with tom wimsett  he assures that the unauthorized checking with drawls were made by mistake and that i will have my checking account credited back i have contacted my bank on  occasions they tell me the deductions are being made by a first national bank of omaha when i call there they say they no longer deal with npc that they have sold the account to someone else this company is a ripoff bfont sizefont colorffeditors suggestions on how to get your money back fontfontb     bfont sizehere is what ripoff report suggests you do fontb   go to your bank within  days of the charge or as soon as you know about the charge dont delay and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account  explain that you wish to file a dispute and demand that they assist you in accordance with federal regulation e    according to the majority of victims interviewed by ripoff report those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far  many victims got the following responses from their banks we could not do anything for you or you waited too long it has been more than  days   if the bank is says that you have waited too long explain to them how you called their  number as soon as the charges were found and were told by the bank that nothing could be done  remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the   and instead provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute  tell the bank that its their fault time has expired and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with they will just have to deal with it take the loss and reverse the charges   tell them the truth this was unauthorized and your account was not to be charged keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything  direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on ripoff reportcom  and if youre at the bank walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site  if you are on the phone with them tell them you will wait while they access this site  either way be persistent     bfont sizedo not take no for an answer fontb   let them know nicely that you were advised to report them the bank and this situation to the banking commission in your state  since each state has a different name for the agencycontroller over banks find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face the more knowledgeable you appear to be the further you will get    and just continue to demand the federal regulation e form the bank can must and will reverse the charge  but you must be persistent ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state    let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day that you would much rather they do the right thing as most other banks have by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charges to your account no matter how long ago it was  be sure to call the media if necessary so you are telling the truth   if you have to be loud but nice in front of other customers if you are just calling by phone the above tactics should still work the bank can easily fax or mail to you the federal regulation e dispute form   bfont sizecharges to your credit cardfontb   if the charge was to your credit card not debit card check card or checking account contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges up to  months but it is better to act right away  in this type of situation credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often wont contest the disputed charge  in rare cases credit card companies will review disputes but refuse to reverse the charges  if this occurs complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here     remember dont let them get away with it   make sure they make the ripoff report  ithe more reports filed on a company or individual the more likely it is that the authorities media and attorneys will want to take action i    and good luck let us know how you do   ed
