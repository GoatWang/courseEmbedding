page →   teraphysics corporationteraphysics corporation develops devices that operate in the terahertz band the last unexploited frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum there are numerous frequencies that lie just above and below the thz band such as infrared and microwave and commercially they have led to multibillion dollar industries such as optical fiber satellite communications radar and cell phones because of the difficulty of operating in this band it is frequently referred to as the “terahertz gap” why hasn’t the thz band been exploited it is not because a lack of potential applications in fact many applications in product inspection food safety communications medical imaging and security have been demonstrated in laboratories commercialization has lagged because of the absence of compact sources and amplifiers of sufficient power to enable development of these opportunity areas teraphysics has successfully developed a practical family of miniaturized thz devices capable of generating and amplifying high levels of thz light  teraphysics is closely collaborating with teraview ltd a uk company and global leader in the development and sale of thz products and applications the combination of teraphysics’ amplification capabilities coupled with teraview’s unparalleled applications knowledge and existing product provides a unique opportunity to grow the terahertz market with its technology and key commercial relationships the teraphysics’ goal is to create a vertically integrated entity that will dominate thz commercialization in the coming years with no visible competition on the horizon teraphysics corporation map alpha park cleveland oh ownerlouis s fisipresidentgerald mearinisecurities disclaimerthis website is for informational

shares of the companys common stock involves a high and sometimes speculative degree of risk and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures in addition prospective investors must rely solely upon the advisor to identify investment opportunities and to negotiate any debt financing prospective investors who are unwilling to rely solely on the advisor should not invest in our shares each prospective investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering and should consult with his own legal tax and financial advisors with respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for

terahertz thz frequency the last unexploited region of the electromagnetic spectrum and  the upper regions of the millimeter wave mmw frequency microwave and infrared the frequencies that border these frequencies have led to multibillion dollar industriesoften referred to as the “terahertz gap” the technology has not been brought to commercialization due to the absence of compact sources and amplifiers capable of generating sufficient power thz is a platform technology that will open many market opportunitiesteraphysics recently achieved a revolutionary advancement the first suite of commercially viable high frequency devices capable of generating and amplifying power levels previously unattainable from solid state and laser enabled sources our revolutionary devices are the most powerful handheld thz and mmw devices in existence teraphysics is the sole owner of the critical proprietary technology that bridges the “thz gap”the initial target markets for teraphysics is food processing and safety and wireless communications thz’s unique ability to detect micro contaminants or foreign materials in a variety of different foodstuffs has led to a number of customerdriven high value applications in food safety and processing teraphysics’ mmw technology provides the wireless industry with a killer eband solution for backhaul and the daunting data transmission demands the wireless industry is faced withwith these technologies teraphysics is closely collaborating with global leaders in multiple market verticals in the development and sale of thz and mmw products and applications with its technology and key commercial relationships teraphysics’ goal is to create a vertically integrated entity that will dominate thz and mmw commercialization there is no visible

inspection market including food safety and food processing customerdriven projects in these markets have demonstrated the unique benefits of the company’s products not achievable with current inspection technologies such as xray microwave or optical imaging we recently entered into a longterm and very profitable relationship with one of the world’s largest food producers they intend to

traffic has more than doubled in each of the last  years and it is predicted to expand at an exponential rate for years to come the international wireless consortium predicts wireless data traffic to increase  fold by the year  with expectations of b devices being placed into service over the next  years twothirds of the growth will come from a massive densification of micro cells and our mmw amplifiers will magnify spectrum reuse dramatically this opportunity has all of the elements of a creative monopoly as outlined in peter thiel’s book zero to one also worth noting the manufacturing of
