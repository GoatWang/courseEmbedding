proxy for a is  weaker residual performance residual loss performance for the nmac platform has softened through q infiniti vehicles in particular have played a larger role in driving losses however losses are still well below peak  levels for both the nissan and infiniti brands fitchs bb rv loss expectation is  of base residual evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels will lead to decreased residual

and loss performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations fitch deems nmac capable of adequately servicing a rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of ce and loss coverage levels available to the notes hence fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transactions initial base case rv and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate x and severe x stresses and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity
