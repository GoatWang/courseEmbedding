management inc about us our services our team resources manager commentary top  investing principles information and links news client access  email us client access top  investing principles the ten most important things a person should know about investing develop a welldefined investment plan that is specific about your return goal your tolerance for risk your ability to have exposure to short term market price volatility your time horizon and your need for income if you are saving for retirement understand what amount of income you will need in retirement and work back from there to understand how much you need to save while you are working understand both the average return and the likely range of returns for key investment asset classes — cash bonds and stocks in other words use reasonable return expectations to guide your investment decisions the most important variable in investing is time horizon – the longer the better compounding is the investor’s most powerful weapon and the length of time that you invest has the biggest effect on your ultimate investment results the earlier you start to invest the more capital you will have at the end a  return doubles your money every  years valuation is critical – it is imperative to know how an investment is valued because that tells you about the likely return and risk in that investment use valuation to turn the probabilities of investment success in your favor have a familiarity with the basic tools and metrics of valuation for the investment that you are considering asset allocation of capital between asset classes is more important than individual security selection within asset classes in determining long term investment results allocate more capital to the most undervalued asset classes and rebalance at least annually reversion to the mean is the most powerful force in the capital markets – use it to your advantage diversification is important but overdiversification hurts returns understand risk from as many perspectives as possible credit liquidity business market industry company specific people etc know what you know know what you don’t know and know the difference have a deep understanding of what you are invested in understand psychological risk the inherent biases that lead to suboptimal investment decisions and be vigilant to mitigate it have an investment process that fits your investment goals and risk profile and be disciplined within that process or hire a professional to manage your investments that has an investment philosophy and process that you understand makes intuitive sense and that you are comfortable with if you hire a professional be aware of all costs and expenses have a healthy skepticism and ask questions total costs and fees for investment management should approximate  of the market value of your portfolio annually have a strong bias to quality because over the long run quality wins out   contactbridgesinvcom   west dodge
