duric phdnamed innovators of the year tuesday november   peter j littrup md and neb duric phd of barbara ann karmanos cancer institute and wayne state university wsu school of medicine were named the state’s innovators of the year during the seventh annual michbio expo held nov  in grand rapids the award recognizes excellence in michigans biosciences community during the past year peter j littrup md neb duric phd dr littrup director of interventional radiology and radiology research for the karmanos cancer institute and professor of radiology wsu school of medicine and dr duric coleader developmental therapeutics program for the karmanos cancer institute and professor of oncology wsu school of medicine received the recognition as the cofounders of delphinus medical technologies inc and the cocreators of a breast cancer imaging device called softvue delphinus is a spinoff company of the karmanos cancer institute formed in november  to manufacture softvue a threedimensional fullbreast ultrasound imaging device that effectively differentiates benign from malignant masses in breast cancer cases using a safe comfortable and reliable patented technology this breast cancer screening technology could one day replace mammography dr littrup and dr duric designed the new screening technology which eliminates some of the limitations of mammography by using ultrasound imaging softvue exams do not involve breast compression or radiation exposure instead the breast is submerged in warm water and an ultrasound ring surrounds the breast capturing detailed threedimensional images through the use of sound waves peter littrup md and neb duric phd of karmanos cancer institute and wsu school of medicine with the softvue prototype because it doesn’t use radiation the softvue system is able to perform repeated imaging a necessary tool for the monitoring and assessment of cancer treatment through its threedimensional capabilities softvue can accurately measure breast density a known risk factor for developing breast cancer the detailed images generated allow radiologists to make accurate breast cancer diagnoses the results are similar to those provided by magnetic resonance imaging mri but testing with the softvue system takes only minutes and costs much less this unique technology helps to accurately detect breast cancer in its early stages even in patients with dense breast tissue sometimes missed by mammography in addition because softvue uses multiparametric ultrasound and sophisticated computer algorithms rather than xrays its believed that it will reduce the number of false positives that can occur with mammography thereby reducing unnecessary biopsies softvue is indicative of the way academic medical research translates from the bench to the bedside and benefits local economies delphinus secured  million in venture capital to begin operations delphinus  latin for dolphin which communicates through underwater sound signals  began seeking funding in late  to design and build the first  machines that will be used in clinical settings around the globe softvue’s lead investor is arboretum ventures of ann arbor mich beringea llc coled the

specialist today call us at karmanos  news news back ultrasound breast cancer imaging device created at the karmanos cancer institute one step closer to fda approval sunday january   watch the feature story  softvue the whole breast ultrasound imaging device created by two scientists from the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute and wayne state university school of medicine is currently undergoing review by the us food and drug administration fda for market clearance its anticipated that this first application clearance could come this spring with several other fda submissions to follow over the next couple of years this promising imaging tool has the potential to aid in detecting breast cancer earlier especially in women with dense breasts peter littrup md and neb duric phd of the karmanos cancer institute and wayne state university school of medicine and their team have been working to perfect the softvue technology for more than a decade the karmanos cancer institute spun off a company in  called delphinus medical technologies to help secure funding to bring this device closer to commercialization since then delphinus has grown to  employees many of whom are engineers and plans are underway to gradually increase the sales staff once the first fda market clearance is obtained    softvue cocreators neb duric phd left and peter littrup md center of the karmanos cancer institute and wayne state university school of medicine are joined with bill greenway ceo of delphinus “we are pleased to see the progress of softvue over the past  years first with the concept followed by the prototype created at karmanos a few years later” said gerold bepler md phd president and ceo of the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute “after years of dedication and hard work by cocreators peter littrup md and neb duric phd along with their team we are delighted that karmanos has the first commercialgrade softvue system to offer to our patients information obtained from this new softvue system will continue the next round of clinical research for use in diagnostic breast imaging “softvue is another example of the exceptional cancer research and innovative technology created right here at the karmanos cancer institute in detroit and built in michigan”        rhonda walker news anchor with wdiv local ’s morning show interviews dr peter littrup of karmanos regarding softvue’s technology photos of amber edmunds healthy baby girl hang on the wall of the softvue room at karmanos edmunds was treated for breast cancer while she was pregnant and agreed to take part in the softvue studies more than  million in funding including venture capital and other grants helped turn softvue’s technology into a commercial product – pending fda clearance to market the first round of venture capital funding included michigan companies arboretum ventures altarum institute beringea llc’s investmichigan growth capital fund and north coast technology investors other funding past and present was received from several private donors along with grants from the national institutes of health the susan g komen breast cancer foundation and the michigan economic development corp currently the karmanos cancer institute has the only commercialgrade softvue system in the world     karmanos breast cancer patient amber edmunds shares her story with rhonda walker of wdiv local  edmunds was five months pregnant when she found out she had breast cancer she had just moved back to detroit and her obgyn referred her to the karmanos cancer institute edmunds now age   is currently receiving radiation treatment at karmanos and is grateful for the wonderful care she’s received at karmanos through her journey she gave birth to a healthy baby girl in august    how softvue works softvue uses ultrasound waves rather than xrays which have the potential to aid in detecting early stages of breast cancer even in women with dense breast tissue often not picked up by mammography  the interaction of sound waves with cancerous tissue yields a unique signature that can be measured using the softvue technology the softvue system collects information not often detected by conventional ultrasound imaging resulting in a more accurate and complete image of the tissue characteristics     the softvue exam takes about one minute per exam produces images for the radiologist in less than  minutes does not involve radiation or compression used in mammography – the current gold standard for breast cancer imaging and   is a fraction of the cost of breast mri magnetic resonance imaging  with softvue the breast is submerged in warm water and an ultrasound transducer ring surrounds the breast without touching it the softvue system transmits and receives ultrasound signals around the entire breast that allow it to capture detailed threedimensional images   the system is able to perform repeated imaging a necessary tool for biopsy monitoring and treatment assessment  softvue’s detailed images aid the radiologist in making an accurate breast cancer diagnosis it’s believed that softvue could help reduce the number of false positives that can occur with mammography and thereby reduce unnecessary biopsies next steps once market clearance is received for the first fda submission other softvue systems will be produced for other medical centers that will take part in clinical studies needed to secure further fda approvals for softvue up to now softvue studies were only for diagnostic purposes showing the quality and safety of this technology compared to other ultrasound breast cancer imaging devices  the company plans to carry out clinical trials involving approximately    subjects to support an fda premarket approval application which once approved will give delphinus the green light to sell softvue for breast cancer screening in the united states william greenway delphinus ceo anticipates that could take until  depending on the number of people participating in the clinical studies at various medical centers as well as funding to manufacture the systems  “once we secure this first fda clearance we’ll receive signed commitments from other health centers that have expressed interest in softvue” said greenway “the approximate cost for the softvue machine is  comparable to mammography we anticipate that we’ll need another    million in venture capital to carry out the trials and produce the machines which will be manufactured in michigan”  how to access softvue mammography is still the gold standard in breast cancer screening however for hospitals and medical centers such as the karmanos cancer institute where softvue will be available softvue will serve as a followup to breast cancer screening upon initial fda market clearance  currently softvue is available at the karmanos cancer institute and karmanos patients may sign up to be part of the ongoing clinical studies once the first fda clearance is secured additional softvue systems will be produced and placed in other medical centers interested in this technology  for more information on softvue technology contact delphinus medical technologies at  for

away that night in the bahamas as karmanos and paul screamed and shouted within earshot of the other guestswe went at it paul recalled later there were a lot of expletivesthe public recordkarmanos sued over his firing and was awarded  million in february by an arbitratordetails of the power struggles boardroom drama questionable tactics by hedge fund investors and even a blackmail allegation would have been sealed forever in secret documents if compuwares new private equity firm owner had accepted the arbitrators decision when compuware appealed the award in court the secrecy that typically shrouds such arbitration cases was liftedwhat emerged from the records and interviews with major players is the story of a botched management transition from a proud dominant founder to a new ceo and of a board of directors lurching from one firestorm to another under siege from activist hedge funds looking for compuware to slash expenses and goose its stock pricemostly perhaps its the behindthescenes story of the last tumultuous years of an imposing corporate presence downtown years and out karmanos picks an exit datethis story begins in early  when karmanos detroits mercurial bighearted corporate icon decided it was time to wind down his long compuware careerhe vowed to retire two years later on the th anniversary of the company he cofounded with two friends in  and led to become a large employer in the region and driver of downtown detroits revivalcompuware got its start in a converted southfield motel and was founded as a services firm to help other companies master their new it systems five years later it began selling its own software products and enjoyed nearly  annual growth its first  years in the mids the company became michigans fifthlargest exportercompuware made karmanos the son of greek immigrants immensely wealthy rich enough to own an nhl hockey team the carolina hurricanes to donate more than  million to the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute in memory of his late first wife and to give  million with current wife danialle to create the karmanos center for natural birth at beaumont hospitalcompuware stayed profitable through most of his long tenure at the helm but revenues and employment fell after the it boom of the late s and early s as compuwares traditional mainframe computer customer base became a smaller part of the it worldcompuware acquired new companies and introduced products in cloud computing and other niches to spur growth one of those companies was covisint headed by paul whom karmanos anointed as compuwares new ceo in  karmanos planned to stick around as executive board chairman until march   when hed retire from active dutyid like to leave with a really great flourish at the end karmanos told the free press in a jan   interviewhe had no idea how prophetic — in the worst of ways — that statement would prove to be karmanos did indeed leave compuware in  but in humiliating fashionsmooth start then conflictat first the handoff of leadership to paul and his executive team looked smooth on june   karmanos slipped into the role of executive chairman with an office down the hall from paulnow i can spend the next year and nine months mentoring those guys and helping them through some tough situations they might face karmanos told the free press at the timebut the companys stock price was stuck in neutral — around  a share when paul became ceo then languished between  and  for the next yearthat december new ceo paul unveiled a threeyear business plan to wall street investors designed to cut costs and focus on highgrowth divisions while still tending to the companys cash cow — software and services for the mainframe marketpaul said his relations with karmanos began to sour over costcutting in the ensuing months all of a sudden the relationship changed paul testified during the arbitration this yearkarmanos for his part said that when activist investors including elliott and sandell asset management soon emerged as buyers of compuware stock they were pushing the firm to do stupid things such as paying the firstever dividend since going public in the reason we didnt pay dividends even though i owned a ton of shares was that it would have handicapped the company karmanos said it was cash the company could not afford to pay outkarmanos said he merely gave paul advice — not orders — and sometimes helped paul persuade board members to spend more money not less on strategic acquisitions of small tech companiesi never gave up on him karmanos said of paul i was fighting for him with the board when they wanted him to do things that were stupid like cut too close to the bonepaul however said karmanos was strongly opposed to laying off employees or cutting projects in detroit where about  of the  remaining employees were based in that is part of petes persona he is about detroit regardless paul said as soon as we started to whittle away at that we started impacting friends we started impacting professionals that he had known for years and he didnt want anything to do with itpaul favored selling the compuware building which had cost  million to build in the early s the building was ultimately sold for  million last december to detroit businessman dan gilbert and meridian healththroughout the cost cutting paul said the executive team used code terms so we didnt freak all the employees out instead of talking about layoffs or selling off units or the headquarters building they would tell wall street about efforts to rationalize the portfolio or optimize the balance sheetpaul also wanted to cut costs related to another karmanos passion ice hockey under karmanos direction compuware became a longtime financial supporter of an ice arena in suburban detroit — the compuware arena — that karmanos owned and where his plymouth whalers junior team played karmanos sold the whalers early this year and they now play

 relations between karmanos and paul were unravelingpaul tried to resign during a shouting match with karmanos on sept  — but he never put his intentions in writingformer detroit mayor dennis archer a

stated in an arbitration affidavitbuy photo photo william archie detroit free presspaul said he threatened to resign sept  when karmanos told him he should fire two top executives and paul disagreedit turned into an fu no fu no fu no fu paul testified at the arbitration hearings i wish that conversation had been more civilright after that clash compuwares chief legal counsel dan follis received a phone call as he was leaving the office for a golf outingi think i just resigned from the company paul told himfollis alarmed asked paul if he had put that in writing or told anyone else compuware would have to immediately report such news to the us securities and exchange commissionpaul replied he hadnt and follis said i think you should hold off because it could be potentially damaging to the company to have a ceo resign without a succession plan in placekarmanos gets his way and more moneypaul agreed to stick around as ceo if board members agreed to prevent karmanos still technically pauls superior from torpedoing business plans paul and the board already promised to deliverhe also insisted karmanos move out of the compuware headquarters where he had an office on the same floorpaul got half what he wanted but stayed anywaykarmanos agreed to fully retire by april  but he would not give up his office he also bargained a richer exit package — the postretirement consulting contract — that would pay him  a year for six years his previous package was a fouryear deal worth around  annuallypaul said board members apologized to him for allowing the awkward standoff with karmanos to drag on so longweve left pete in this position too long weve done you a disservice and we apologize paul said he was told by board members who decided karmanos would not be involved in operations but keep the executive chairman title through march  ok thats fine paul said he told the board but he needs to be moved out of this building because its a disruption to me and the rest of the organizationthe board waffled on that office relocation request however telling him were not sure we can do that and blah blah blah paul said laterkarmanos stayed puti think they kept him around because were paying him … a lot of money for six years paul said they had to have him do somethingon oct  compuware filed an k report with the sec that disclosed terms of the new exit package and said gurminder bedi the lead independent board member would become the next chairman after karmanos left on march no news release was issued about the filingnine days later in a free press interview karmanos said he was cutting ties with the board so he could work on some technology ideas while having an arms length relationship with compuwareim smart enough to know who i am karmanos said and ill need to turn the compuware part off otherwise ill be a pestas the holiday season approached in late  an uneasy truce was in place at compuwareit would not last longattack of the hedge fund compuwares business though profitable had been shrinking for more than a decade as it relied heavily on mainframe software and services for the bulk of its revenuesin fall  elliott management an activist investor in publicly traded companies it sees as underperforming or undervalued went on a compuware stockbuying spree ultimately becoming the companys biggest shareholderowned by billionaire financier paul singer with more than  billion in assets under management elliott was also known for its highprofile legal battle with argentina for full bond payments when the country defaulted in  the hedge fund went as far as to detain an argentine naval vesselon dec   elliott made an unsolicited takeover bid of  pershare for all of compuware or  billionbuy photo photo martha thierry detroit free presspaul received word of the surprise offer in a phone call from jesse cohn the hedge funds portfolio managerhe said bob were putting in an offer for your company for  its going to hit the press in  seconds paul said during arbitration proceedingsactivist investors like elliott take stakes in companies they think need improvement and attempt to pressure their boards to make big changes such as slashing costs spinning off divisions paying cash to shareholders or putting the company up for salecompuware was a ripe target for activism revenues had fallen from more than  billion in  to less than  billion and wall street believed the company could easily boost profitability by cutting expenses trimming its workforce and selling off divisionsto help evaluate the buyout offer compuware hired goldman sachs the new york investment bankkarmanos was no fan of either goldman sachs or activist investors like elliottactivists he said during arbitration generally dont act in the best interests of the employees the customers the company or the other shareholders and goldman sachs in karmanos opinion was more interested in extracting fees than the longterm interests of companies it advisedaccording to compuwares lawyers karmanos acted belligerent openly caustic and blatantly disrespectful during goldman sachs presentation to compuwares board on how to respond to elliotts offerkarmanos said he worried the structure of goldmans contract gave wrong financial incentives they made a lot of money if they had a proxy fight or if the company was sold he said and if none of those events happened they made a smaller feekarmanos said he suggested staggering the election years of compuware board seats this classic antiactivist strategy would make it harder for elliott to wage a proxy battle and gain control of the company by keeping more board seats out of reachother compuware board members were cool to that ideapersonal information and intimidationgoldman warned compuwares board that elliott had many tools to get its way — even personal intimidationthey soon experienced this firsthandin arbitration testimony several compuware board members recalled a meeting

to put up with all this stuff grabe said in arbitration testimony so youre dealing with somebody whose tactics it is to intimidate to splinter to do everything they can to be disruptive to the board

car that paul kept at home in his garage that few people knew abouthe said by the way love that english car youre driving  paul recalled how the hell would he know that rightoffer rejected as too lowasked for comment an elliott management spokesman last week told the free press in a statement that the conflicts of interest on the compuware board were well reported and broadly documented despite these issues elliott was pleased to have worked with compuware to reach a successful outcome for the company and for shareholdersin his arbitration testimony earlier this year henderson recalled the hedge funds concerns that compuwares board had too many longtenured directors and some were too close to karmanos elliott also said there werent enough directors with relevant skills and experience in the fastchanging software industryon jan   compuwares board rejected the elliotts buyout offer as too lowyet the rejection was not a fullthroated rebuke to elliott which remained the companys largest shareholder with just under  of the stocktoo many detroiterswhen it turned down the offer compuware also announced plans for the companys firstever dividend to shareholders and launched a costreduction program that quickly resulted in  layoffsseveral weeks before his retirement karmanos fired back at elliotts criticism that compuwares board was parochial with too many detroiters and not enough technology expertshaving the former ceo of general motors on your board is not a good thing karmanos asked in a free press interview having the woman who ran a university those arent good enough credentials to be on our board having the former mayor of the city of detroit a former michigan supreme court judge and head of the american bar association on your board is not a good thing were doing all the right things not all the wrong things with the boardhe was referring to henderson of gm glenda price of marygrove college and former detroit mayor dennis archera hedge fund karmanos said can come in rip apart the pieces of it and try to have a fire sale and maybe make  on their money and they look like heroes and if thats what happens to compuware he surmised whatevers left of the company probably would not be in detroitchaos in paradisethat spring of  as compuwares board was alternately appeasing and trying to fend off the takeover threats from wall street plans were under way for festive events to mark karmanos retirement and the companys th anniversaryone was the may  blacktie dinner at the atlantis paradise island resort in the bahamas as part of an annual trip for rewarding top compuware sales performers photo pr newswirekarmanos and his wife danialle were on hand paul was too along with the sales stars and other compuware executives including denise starr the chief administrative officer and lisa elkin head of marketing and investor relationsstarr and elkin had prepared a humorous roastlike powerpoint presentation for the dinner sprinkled with madeup dialogue that had karmanos sputtering snarky profanitylaced comments about sarbanesoxley act rules for corporate boards and behaviorstarr and elkin also had been working for months with danialle karmanos on plans for two other celebrations to honor peter — a formal gala june  at detroit city airport and an employee event outside the downtown headquarters possibly at campus martiusinitial plans called for compuware to pay for events paul had approved a combined budget of  million a few months earlier after more expensive ideas such as hiring pop stars sheryl crow or kid rock to perform were discardedas time went on paul — aware of potential criticism — proposed spreading the  million in expenses over two fiscal quartersonly a handful of people inside compuware knew about the cost of the parties or that paul had approved the budget — at a time when activist investors were pressuring the firm to cut costs and share more cash with shareholdersthat included most board members that is until they received their invitations in the mail for the vip eventbuy photo photo salwan georges detroit free pressboard members henderson and g scott romney brother of mitt romney would later say that paul erred in authorizing company funding for a gala at city airportthe invites arrived in footlong black envelopes with white cursive lettering announcing the pleasure of your company is requested at an esoteric bacchanalia for peter karmanos jr the attire gown  gloves white jacket tuxedo​alarm bells went off for henderson and others my wife received the invitation and when she opened it she said youre never going to believe this  henderson later recalledhenderson conferred with compuware board chairman bedi and another director bedi phoned paul that morning in the bahamas and said the company couldnt be financing such extravagance when employees were being laid offhenderson who headed gm during the automakers chapter  bankruptcy and us government control in  immediately saw a potential problem in funding a priceylooking party when compuware was a takeover target laying off workers and drawing criticism from activist investors for spending too much moneyi felt like it sent exactly the wrong message he said you almost couldnt do anything worse if youre in an activist campaign but to have an event like this which would undoubtedly be covered publiclyboard member grabe a former ibm executive also was jarred by the party invitation which he recalled was the size of a license platemy reaction was geez its over the top grabe saidif compuware was going to pay for this thing it was insane he added in arbitration testimony were firing people all over the place not because they cant perform but we cant afford to keep them and make moneykarmanos in a recent interview recalled the boards angst over the party this way as it turned out it had nothing to do with the amount of money it had everything to do with optics thats what they were worried about and i said go tell them to take their optics and stuff it  parties and layoffsfrom the newly public arbitration records its clear that compuware officials tried to conceal the companys role in funding the karmanos retirement gala an email from a party vendor stated that she was told it is imperative that no one knows that the gala is being paid for by the companydenise starr a former compuware executive involved with the party planning conceded as much in her arbitration case deposition saying because of all of the things that the company was going through at the time with cost cutting and employees being laid off if it were to be you know on the street that we can afford to be paying for contracts for food or whatever it might not be perceived of properlywhen asked if ceo paul or her other superiors approved of concealing the fact that the company was paying for the gala starr replied yeahmost compuware board members later swore under oath that they didnt know paul had sanctioned a million budget for the retirement celebrations as they found out the decision was made to cancel the partiespaul sent an email to starr and elkin telling them to cancel the fundingstarr informed the party vendor while paul broke the news to karmanos in the bahamasthen came another bombshellkarmanos a blackmailer or is paul a liarin deposition testimony paul claimed that karmanos during their shouting match in the bahamas threatened to join elliotts hostile takeover bid against compuware and advise them on which board members to replace if the party funding was not restoredkarmanos had an upcoming meeting with the hedge funds billionaire owner paul singerkarmanos himself emphatically denies making such a threat he did travel on the compuware jet to meet singer in new york later on may  he said but with different intentionssinger and karamanos were substantial contributors to mitt romneys unsuccessful  presidential campaign so karmanos asked compuware board member scott romney if his brother mitt could arrange a meeting with singerkarmanos soon found himself on singers appointment calendarthe reason for this trip karmanos said was to defuse tensions between elliott and compuwarepaul conceded he didnt immediately sound an alarm or call an emergency board meeting about karmanos threat instead he said he waited until the next morning and told only bedi compuwares new chairmanpaul testified that karmanos put it this way it was just a matteroffact thing im going to new york — and this is screaming – this is what im going to fing do to you e powell miller karmanos lawyer in the later arbitration case described the notion as ludicrous no sooner would churchill join hitler than pete would join with elliott and the activist hedge funds he saidkarmanos had long taken a dim view of wall street hedge funds and analysts as shortterm thinkers looking to make a quick buck it was probably no coincidence that compuware was targeted by activist investors around the time karmanos who would be a fierce opponent declared his intention in  to set a retirement datekarmanos in his own arbitration case testimony described his exchange about elliott very differentlyhe recalled saying to paul what the hell is going on do these guys the compuware board members want me to get involved in some proxy fight against them jesus you know its like theyre telling me i should do that are they trying to goad me into a proxy fightthreat or no threat the karmanossinger meeting in the hedge fund billionaires office proved uneventfuli said  you know these guys the compuware leadership are really working very hard very hard and it would be nice if you could give them some time and patience karmanos recalled telling singer and paul singer says i think we can do that in fact im sure we can do that when paul asked the next day how it went he said karmanos replied well i just told everybody to be patient — and thats pretty much how things played out a standstill agreement where elliott promised to hold off on further bids for the company was subsequently extended twicepaul later said he worried that karmanos wasnt telling him everythingyou dont go meet paul singer right multibillionaire paul singer just to tell him to be patient paul said so my antennas were up trying to figure out whether we were about to engage in a holy warthe next explosion came just a day later — not from a wall street hedge fund but an aggrieved spouse charging that compuware had done her man wrongangry email sets off fireworksdanialle karmanos said she knew nothing of compuwares cancellation of funding for her husbands retirement events she had helped plan until a vendor informed her may  in a preschool parking lot where karmanos was with her four young sonsshe got very angrytwo days later she sent a blistering email to nine compuware board members — and a few detroit journalistsa particularly sinister and vile move she called compuwares withdrawal of funding for the fancy gala at city airport the invitations had already been sent to gov snyder detroits thenmayor dave bing and a host of corporate ceos and other vipsshe lashed out at ceo paul and called him a cowardthe community employee and media perception is that bob is threatened by pete and sabotaged the events to recognize him as a leader she wrotewithin hours danialles email was frontpage news it was also the hot conversation topic at a dinner that night for compuware directors and top officerspaul was extremely upset about the email said laura fournier compuwares chief financial officer at the time adding bob is hanging his head and going i dont know how i can ever go forward because petes around other board members commiserated that a founder ceo like karmanos should not be allowed to stay in the headquarters buildingthe next day paul for the first time put his allegation in writing to board members about karmanos threatening to join elliott in a proxy fight against compuware the email was sent a few minutes before the boards regularly scheduled meetingby then karmanos had already returned from new yorkamid the friction between peter karmanos and paul and the furor over danialle karmanos nowpublic email the board issued karmanos a written warning to behave and ordered him to vacate his office in the compuware buildingscott romney who had been on compuwares board since  would later testify that the companys handling of the aborted karmanos retirement events was certainly an embarrassing situation for the karmanos family and for all of us me includedvacate the officeto this day karmanos insists that compuware was wrong to cancel the retirement eventsthey would have accrued great benefit to the company they would have helped transition all the relationships i had with different business leaders politicians journalists over to bob and the company those are valuable assets karmanos said in a recent interviewkarmanos said the parties had nothing to do with his own egoi didnt need a party to reintroduce myself to people he said adding if i had one director that had a set of balls it would have been nice of them to say you know what i dont give a damn what the optics look like this is the guy that started the company hes been here for  years and is retiring and we have an obligation to have this kind of event a month after karmanos was told to vacate his office at headquarters fournier was fired as chief financial officer bob paul asked me to leave because he didnt think that i could handle the change that was coming up in the company she saidat the arbitration hearing  months after her dismissal fournier reflected on the office tension during the time when paul and karmanos were at oddsbob paul is very insecure she said so that was why if i went to talk to pete in any capacity if i didnt run back and make sure bob knew why i went into petes office there would be backlash bob wanted to control the relationship with pete he was very insecure about itso karmanos was gone from the board of the company he founded banished from his office in the compuware headquarters he had built but he was still on the company payroll collecting a ayear consulting feeand he just couldnt resist one last ranta goodfellows rant the last strawit came on sept   four months after karmanos was tossed out of his office in the compuware buildingkarmanos was guest of honor at the old newsboys goodfellows tribute breakfast where he received the edward h mcnamara goodfellow of the year award before an audience of several hundred business peopleafter the breakfast in response to a reporters question about compuware karmanos said the companys management needs to get their head out of their ass all right and understand they have more responsibility than playing some kind of silly game with some jerks in new york cityif he were still in charge he would tell the hedge fund to go f themselvesbuy photo photo regina h boone detroit free presscompuwares board and management he added were too focused on shareholders ceo means community employees and then the ownersthe comments caught on tape were reported and played by local media including at freepcomat the time compuware was still a tense place the latest standstill agreement with elliott had just expired and board members were bracing for a possible proxy fight for control of the companyceo paul was outraged over karmanos latest barbshe sent an angry email to bedi the board chairman and directors grabe and henderson advocating cancellation of karmanos consulting contracti believe this is the last straw and could be considered disparagement paul wrote adding at some point the employees of this company need to see their new leader stand up to this buffoonthe compuware board met sept  by telephone and after  minutes of discussion voted  to terminate karmanos ayear contract based chiefly on his disparagement of the company and its managementdennis archer who was detroit mayor when karmanos decided to relocate compuware from suburban farmington hills and build a new office tower downtown was the lone dissenting voteralph szygenda a board member who had previously been gms chief information officer asked if the board should explore giving karmanos one more chance a final warning instead of terminating him but no one aside from archer bit on the idea so szygenda joined the majority vote to firelee roberts one of the new board members who joined in  said in an affidavit pete is an embarrassment to himself the company he built and to this board and executivesand scott romney a longtime karmanos friend also voted to terminate his contract saying pete has become a tragic figure time for compuware to go forward and growunknown to some board members their vote to terminate karmanos consulting contract also triggered the cancellation of  million worth of his vested options in company stocktwo months later karmanos sued compuware claiming it acted illegally in canceling the consulting job and stock optionsbreakup and buyout by thoma bravocompuwares final chapter as a publicly owned stock company

managed the headquarters move downtown in the early s she was hired last fall by mayor mike duggan to be detroits director of human resourcespete was a visionary a risktaker and i feel badly that hes never been recognized for all he did for the city she saidin an interview last week paul said the outcome for compuwares employees and shareholders would have been far worse if not for the steps he and his management team took to restructure and ultimately sell the company amid the intense pressure from activist investorsif wed have left the business alone paul said far more jobs would have been
