sovereign wealth funds wealth management disruptive innovation fintech disruptive innovation december  24 a force for strategic change in investment management operations read article and learn about disruption as a changemaker identifying disruptive innovation opportunities disruptive business models and their potential acting on disruptive opportunities in a systematic way about the author matt christensen is ceo and portfolio manager of rose park advisors   matt cofounded rose park advisors with harvard business school hbs professor clayton christensen in  prior to this matt christensen was a strategy consultant at innosight and the boston consulting group he holds a bse in civil engineering from duke university and an mba from hbs   about rose park advisors rose park advisors llc is a boutique investment firm based in boston ma and specializing in identifying investment opportunities by applying the disruptive innovation concept more information at httpwwwroseparkadvisorscom the investment management industry faces constant change we interview matt christensen ceo of rose park advisors for his insights into how firms can learn to identify opportunities for disruptive innovation how disruption is shaping the industry and how to operate successfully within this gamechanging environment  journal please describe rose park’s business activities in the context of the ‘disruptive innovation’ concept as defined by its cofounder professor christensen who as your father is also clearly a source of professional and academic inspiration matt christensen our investment decisions are driven by my father’s theories in disruptive innovation and related fields hence we invest exclusively in companies where his research gives unique and differential insights into the investment thesis so rather than identifying the phenomenon of disruptive innovation in hindsight we look at ways to apply it prospectively for over seven years now we have been investing in companies we believe have the ability to act on disruptive opportunities this could be anywhere in the world and in any industry journal what exactly is disruptive innovation and how does it apply to your operations matt christensen disruptive innovation describes a process by which a product or service takes root in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market eventually displacing established competitors or completely removing competition many of the firms that grow from startups to become industry giants are built around innovations that create new markets or reshape existing ones they enable change just as established firms systematically underestimate how large entrant competitors will become tools of financial analysis systematically underestimate their growth potential because these entrant firms tend to be misunderstood the market misjudges their impact presenting us with an investment opportunity however it is important to note that disruptive product innovation can ensue in large existing companies such as global institutional investment managers just as well as in changing innovative business settings   disruptive innovation – a definition disruptive innovation describes a process by which a product or service takes root in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market eventually displacing established competitors or completely removing competition journal you mentioned change how can disruptive innovation be perceived as a force for change matt christensen in our market change is constant the type of firms we are interested in investing in must be geared to absorb and grow through change we look for companies that are able to successfully manage the processes of identifying disruptive innovation opportunities measuring option value and acting on the outcome of the result analysis our investment approach stretches over years even with public companies so we put a lot of time into the due diligence process and expect to be longterm holders of stocks on the long side we apply the disruptive innovation framework to identify companies whose strategy is well suited to take advantage of change and will consistently beat the market with superior earnings on the short side we identify incumbent companies whose future vitality is threatened by disruptive attackers this investment strategy has enabled our portfolio to consistently achieve superior performance since its inception journal in the article ‘reinventing your business model’ professor christensen asks “why is it so difficult for established companies to pull off the new growth that business model innovation can bring”  drawing on your own experience how does this apply to investment management firms and the type of operating models they choose matt christensen there will always be disruptive activity altering one or another segment of the investment management industry to take one example the introduction of exchangetraded funds etfs disrupted longestablished ways of doing business in the mutual funds sector firms arose that employed disruptive indexfund strategies to gain competitive advantage over their competitors in the sector this process allowed individual investors cheaper and easier access to investment vehicles that were previously the exclusive preserve of professional asset managers there will always be disruptive activity altering one or another segment of the investment management industry journal how and in what ways did the etf example make it hard for firms to reassess their business models matt christensen essentially you were able to tap into a new market that was unattractive to the existing players because an etf’s fee structure is much lower and makes it hard for any firm that does not have enormous volumes to make money doing it if you have an index fund even an actively managed fund or something similar you risk cannibalizing your cash cow the key problem here is always going to be that the incumbent firms have a fee structure they are inclined to protect rather than undermine this is what makes it so hard for them to change – the overhead they have and the processes that have helped them succeed in the past all wind up preserving the existing model rather than reinventing it journal are there any other examples where you see this happening matt christensen it remains to be seen but there’s a good possibility that we will see this happen again with efforts at hedgefund emulation that provide hedged strategies through retail investors it is a model that undermines the fee structure of an incumbent firm and provides a security or a service to a group of investors that is new that has historically been outside of the capital market and that has the opportunity to be disruptive journal how does disruptive innovation assist rose park advisors in its everyday investment management operations matt christensen we have a very broad investment mandate in some ways and in other ways a very narrow one it’s broad in that we’re allowed to invest in any type of security any geography or any industry by far the most important selection criterion is whether the company we choose to invest in matches the framework of disruptive innovation this is critical for us journal what about startups are all startups potentially disruptive and able to succeed matt christensen not all startups follow a model that i would describe as disruptive if your strategy as a new entrant is to leap ahead of incumbents and beat them at their own game it’s a very hard thing to pull off but if you target a new concept a new market or a new business model as a startup i think your chances are much better here i think that what we are really good at is evaluating the disruptive potential of business models we look for companies that have disruptive business models that allow them to target new markets here i think that what we are really good at is evaluating the disruptive potential of business models we look for companies that have disruptive business models that allow them to target new markets journal how can the disruptive innovation framework help investment managers create new growth opportunities are there any basic steps to follow here matt christensen there are two aspects to that one is evaluating the investment the other is trying to serve your clients better or broaden the client base in relation to the first i really think it is not enough to just focus on looking for growth among companies that are seeking out new markets and hoping to grow in these what you should be looking for are firms that are seeking to grow on a sustained basis over the long term by building a new market through addressing different potential needs or product areas journal what benefits does successful application of disruptive innovation bring to the table apart from competitive advantage can you cite any working examples drawn from the investment management industry matt christensen i think some working examples can be found in the industry one is in the area of big data companies that engage in data visualization like tableau software produce interactive data visualization products focused on business intelligence bi what they do is put analytical decisionmaking powers in the hands of middle managers who are usually not particularly sophisticated data analysts by presenting these analytics visually in the way of dashboards and the like they make it easier for frontline managers and others to reach decisions that are based on swift and accurate data it’s also worth mentioning the rapid adoption of realtime payments trading and settlement systems that will foster innovation in the industry and meet client demands for greater ease of use and personalized service in the digital age journal where do you see other potential industryrelated areas for disruptive innovation when it comes to the operating model matt christensen one area for consideration here would be softwareasaservice saas that is targeted at specific industry verticals it’s interesting to observe that if as a manager you had to buy a permanent license for a software suite and the cost was fully paid up in advance you are likely to be more reticent in deploying software solutions because of the high investment required upfront if you buy the license and the software doesn’t work the way your firm wants you can risk your career as an it professional but if a software service exists where you pay by the month you can start to roll it out and if it looks like it’s not working you just cut it off and limit your losses a solution like this lets your it try different things and see what works and what doesn’t journal looking ahead what do you foresee are the main challenges for investment management firms in general – and the growth opportunities matt christensen i think the main challenge in the long term is regulation it would be delusional to think that you could have a market with no regulations but the cost of doing business has grown so much that many opportunities rarely get off the ground because what is required of them from a regulatory perspective seems so onerous however this is also where the opportunity lies you must look for opportunities to proactively use disruptive innovation to turn regulatory change market shocks changing client demand and moves away from regular business models into competitive advantage when you ask about growth opportunities there is no doubt that emerging markets are very attractive here we see markets that lack services and products and you can compete against nothing – now that’s an attractive opportunity in a lot of instances you have to develop a different model to provide the goods or services you are seeking to deliver profitably journal to summarize what do you regard as the steps firms need to take to deliver on the promise of disruptive innovation matt christensen disruption is happening all around us there are many opportunities in the investment management industry as well and it is possible to deal with disruption as the industry continues to experience repeated market shocks client demands and regulatory pressures the success of individual firms will hinge on proactively responding to these changing business conditions those that fail to act will lose – clients business and competitive advantage understanding and using disruptive innovation as a tool can enable investment managers to optimize their business by adding new clients new products and hence securing competitive advantage if you want to harness the growth potential that disruptive innovation offers key is building disruption into your corporate ecosystem and acting on disruptive opportunities in a systematic ritualized way see box on ‘how investment managers can succeed in disruptive innovation’ how investment managers can succeed in disruptive innovation matt christensen ceo rose park advisors based on the framework of “how managers can effectively respond to opportunities for disruptive innovation” as outlined in ‘the innovator’s dilemma’ by clayton christensen professor hbs look for product opportunities in areas that are unattractive for mainstream investors let resources flow to product development and research for business areas in flux legally in terms of risk exposure and technologically utilize an experimental approach to product development start small prepare for rapid scaling experiment in product development learn from factbased analysis and improve rigorously until limits of opportunities are reached or risk turns unknown   ✕ back share this story we use cookies to ensure our website works
