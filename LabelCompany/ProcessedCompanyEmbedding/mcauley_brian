main topic suggested – shop safety while working alone mark shaw – hey guys first off love the podcast and each of your youtube channels keep up the great work a few weeks ago the making it post cast briefly touched on the topic of shop safety when working alone and i was hoping to get your take on this  i think the same is true for most wood workers and hobbyists that we work alone in our shops and some of us have shops in attached garages i often worry about what would happen if i had an accident while alone in the shop or if there were to be a shop fire especially when i am not there  i have a  car attached garage shop do you guys share these concerns how does it impact the work that you do avoiding tasks that have risk stopping when you are tired asking for help and what precautions do you take  i am thinking about first aid kits and being prepared for more than slivers and small cuts and what i should have in there  fire suppression chemical storage integrating smoke detectors with ones in the house for earlier warning method to call for help wireless ip cameras to keep an eye on the shop etc thanks mark mark’s custom wood creations beeton ontario canada guest question none… listener questions email and comments brodie brickey – really enjoyed the ‘self employed’ episode during it brian mentioned a client who kept changing her mind ultimately she wasn’t worth his time due to difficultly does anyone have a contract with the client –sign off design  collect x dollars for materials – completed collect x dollars –finished collect remaining here’s the killer –change made after design sign off comes with a change charge you set the charge  the add on for hours that it takes  with this method your client can keep changing their mind all they want you will still get paid matt thayer – hey guys been loving the show i still listen to it like its my job anyways sean regarding the cedar strip canoe they are not as complicated as they look i am a  year old woodworker that is in between his st and nd year at the international yacht restoration school in newport rhode island i am in the wooden boat building and restoration program i am currently building a roubo workbench for a summer project to complete internship hours and another student is building a cedar strip canoe for his summer project i have been picking his brain about it knowing you wanted to build one and he has built a couple before this one he likes the bear mountain boats plans like nick offerman and jimmy diresta built they have printed out mold patterns which you just glue on and cut on the band saw like most boats there is a ton of setup he made a big strongback to mount the molds on then you have to make the molds he is building a ′ ″ and he got ′ western red cedar boards and i believe he used like  or  sheets of ply he is using the bead and cove method and wood gluing all the edges together then after the strips are laid it gets fiber glassed over that method is the slow method because you have to clamp each strip and let the glue dry if you were to brad nail the strips to the molds and glue the seams you could plank the whole boat very fast the gunnels sheer clamps stems breast hooks and thwarts are all very straight forward and i don’t think you want me to make this damn email any longer then it already is 🙂 the boat we built in the first year a ish’ single mast carvel planked sail boat was so much harder to build and a lot of the students had never even touched a hand plane or a chisel before they are pretty straightforward boats if you can have the patience to make the bed you made for your daughter and do that kind of inlay a canoe is a piece of cake again sorry for the long email and love the show itunes reviews shophumblehome – amazing

question none… listener questions email and comments dave kunkle – hi guys i’ve been an avid listener of your podcast from the beginning and enjoy it very much i wanted to ask a question have you ever built something for a client and not been able to get it into their house or into the room the piece is going i’m in the process of building an  x ″ dining table and matching bench for a client what design considerations do you make for fitting through doorways around corners etc do you build larger pieces of furniture in such a way that they are assembled on site my last project was a map cabinet and i’m thankful that i made the bottom detachable because it was about a ″ too wide to fit through the doorway i had asked the client for the width of his doorway but he measured from the inside of the frame and didn’t allow for the doorstop trim or whatever it’s called i don’t want a similar situation with the dining table thanks for any thoughts you have about this keep doing what you’re doing it’s appreciated dave kunkel wildside woodworking wildsidewoodworking chad mckamey – i have recently started building furniture on the side as extra income shop upgrade money i have had a few large pieces but mostly adirondack chairs which are quick and easy i’m wanting to get into more custom high end pieces using hardwoods and more traditional building methods the problem is that in my local area people are building big box store lumber pieces for ridiculously low prices farmhouse table and benches for  their quality is subpar at best how do i find the clients that are wanting a quality piece and how do i convey my quality to clients so they understand that my product is worth my asking price thank you guys for entertaining me every week love the show and what you do for the

podcast listener questions email and comments robby wright – gents in a recent show you commented about leaving dust collectors running because you can damage the motors by starting and stopping them too much in my experience as a woodworker industrial electrician and an electrical contractor i suggest that you are only partly right most dust collectors that are  hp maybe  hp and smaller have fairly lightweight impellers on them they can be started and stopped frequently without an issue dust collectors with heavy impellers such as the  hp units have a heavier startup load and shouldn’t be started as frequently frequently is more than more than  times an hour i have a  hp taiwanese dust collector that i have used for  years now it is controlled  by a current sensing circuit that turns the dust collector on and off any time a monitored tool such as my table saw bandsaw etc is turned on or off in the initial stages of a project it is not unusual to start and stop both the table saw and dust collector many times in an hour and it hasn’t damaged anything in the motor in those  years remember that the only parts that can be damaged are the starting switch capacitor windings and bearings in a single phase motor the starting switch will wear but that is normal the capacitor doesn’t normally wear as it is engaged for only a few seconds unless the starting switch is welded shut the bearings aren’t going to be hurt from this type of starting and stopping leaving only the heat in the windings to do damage as long as the motor doesn’t overheat you are good to go for three phase motors only heat needs to be worried about when starting the only real load on the motor is the inertia of the impeller the load of the air movement doesn’t occur until the impeller starts to get up to speed even with all gates open the motor is going to be running at less than full rating if properly designed i measured my motor and it only draws about threefourths of its rated current even under maximum load of my dust collection system the more gates that are closed the less load on the system by the way if anyone is interested in a current sensing controller for your dc you can find my article on it in fine woodworking aug  or the fww on small shops book by taunton press enjoy your show – keep up the good work nick hinson – i recently broke my mini lathe and almost died in the process i want to get a full sized one now i’m going to have to go used because i don’t have the moolah to get a new full sized one this means looking up old lathe model numbers and figuring out which one has what i need and if they’re worth the price they’re listed at the problem is i’m not sure i know what all features are needed in a full sized lathe since i’m so used to the tiny bench top one i had what are some musthaves for you guys in a lathe anything that isn’t a must but is super useful to have also any of you guys wanna sell a lathe for cheap 😉 thanks guys arron sparrow – hey guys love your podcast  this comment is a few weeks old so please forgive me  when you were talking about future builds or pieces you would like to build in the future one of you mentioned a canoe  i believe you also talked about how much work a cedar strip canoe would be to build  i am also a dream builder of canoes and here is one i might start with for the following reasons  it looks good in that the above the waterline parts are mostly cedar strips  but the below the waterline parts are plywood this seems to be a good compromise between good looks and ease of build see an example in the following link httpwwwclcboatscomshopboatskayakkitsmillcreekhybridtandemrecreationalkayakkithtml keep up the great podcast aaron sparrow stian johannessen – hey great podcast you guys keep up the good work this is the podcast i look forward to the most during my week my question for you guys is should i now get a cheaper band saw and then see if it works with my workflow or wait  months and just buy the better quality one i have been checking our equivalent of craigslist for the last  months but no good deals there only overpriced low quality stuff been wanting learn how to resaw and use homemade veneer and maybe even use it as a small makeshift mill as a way to start making my own lumberps since i don’t live in the states i can’t leave a review there but here it comes the dusty life is the nr

listener questions email and comments matthew moore –  hey guys first off i stumbled upon your podcast a couple weeks ago and haven’t been able to stop listening to it since keep up the good work i have a dilemma that i was hoping for some advice on i am pretty new to wood working and have been making some cutting boards as well as doing some home projects so far i have a bunch of handmedown stuff from my dad and grandfather which include a craftsman circular saw ” craftsman single bevel miter saw and some hand planes i’ve also recently purchased a ” delta thickness planer and ” pioneer jointer along with some kreg jigs and a router and table as well as various other tools for most projects i can get by with what i have however i am a bit of a perfectionist and it kills me when there are tools that could make certain tasks easier andor more accurate and i don’t have them so my wife came to me a few days ago and told me that for father’s day and my birthday she had enlisted the help of our parents and between them i have  to buy some more woodworking tools i’ve been in the market for a table saw as well as a dust collector and have been scouring craigslist to try and find something worth buying also my shop is in my basement and is pretty small ’ x ’ at the moment with plans to move one wall back so it will be ’ x ’ which brings me to my questions would my money be better spent on a dust deputyshop vac type dust collection system rather than a dedicated dust collector and would i be able to do most things with a good track saw rather than spend the money on a table saw that would take up quite a bit of real estate in my shop i am ripping down sheet goods in my driveway as it is to bring them into my shop through a bulk head so that is where the track saw intrigues me thank you in advance and sorry for being so long winded stay dusty my friends cheers matt itunes reviews ugwgkm – i like donuts –  stars – listening to this podcast is like eating an

listener questions email and comments rob berger –  thanks for the great shows as a new woodworker i really enjoy them as well as each of your youtube channels i had an epiphany as i was listening to your last show about kyle’s veneered globe dream project when you buy a globe buy  identical globes and make sure they don’t have any raised topography cut the first one like you’re slicing an orange and use it as a template for your veneer slices lay them on the second globe as dry fit testing cut the third globe in half or quarters or whatever you want and use the inside of it as a negative image caul to apply even pressure to the veneer pieces once glued stay dusty rob berger johnny tromboukis –  hey guys in reference to kyle’s dream build a super awesome globe i may have found a solution to the tricky situation of clamping the veneer glue up what if you split the globe in half and glue on the veneers to each half in your vacuum bag then obviously glue the two domes together to get your sphere hope this helps marcin szczepanski –  hey dudes thanks for the awesome podcast  appreciate your guys’ relaxed style constant interaction with your audience and even the occasional fbomb and by f i mean fuck ha two questions just got commissioned to build a large dining table made of ash yep it’ll be a big ash table  the top will be ’l x ″w and ″ thick total of bf  having always made things of reclaimed wood this will be my first hardwood order  with the size in mind how much ash would you order for the top taking into consideration waste secondly the customer wants a weatheredtextured finish where you can run your fingers across the top and feel the grain normally with dougfir this can easily be done with a wire wheel to give it that texture  any suggestions on how i could accomplish this with ash  do any of you have experience mediablasting wood before to weather it anyways hope this isn’t too long  thanks for any help and keep up the great work marcin
