investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles a portfolios ownership zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the funds portfolio within the proprietary morningstar style box™ the shaded area represents the center  of the funds assets and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests a centroid plot in the middle of the ownership zone represents the weighted average of all the funds holdings a fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style over a period of time the shape and location of a funds ownership zone may vary the model for the fixedincome style box is based on the two pillars of fixedincome performance interestrate sensitivity and credit quality the three interest sensitivity groups are limited moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high medium and low these groupings display a portfolios effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the funds risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio the sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities while the distribution rate

the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund bond statistic average duration in years expressed in years average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the funds portfolio to a given change in interest rates with respect to individual bonds for example a duration of  years indicates that the price of a bond will risefall by approximately  if rates in general fallrise by  typically bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes bond statistic average life in years expressed in years average life is time weighting the expected principal payments taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments in general it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity eg mortgages mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the funds portfolio bond statistic average yield to maturity a weighted average of all the funds bond holdings yield to maturities yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity based on its
