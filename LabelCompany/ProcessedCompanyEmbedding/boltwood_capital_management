different roles and have different levels of responsibilities to their client although many advisors use different terminology in general advisors come in some version of the following investment managers manage assets according to a particular strategy in a pooled portfolio on behalf of their clients  they have no obligation to make sure the investments they are making are in the best interest for their clients asset allocators these managers outsource investment advice via mutual funds or other investment avenues  more time is spent on vetting managers than on which investments to make registered investment advisors rias  independent managers manage separate accounts on behalf of each client they serve  these advisors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients  ria’s are not compensated for transactions but rather the objective advice they provide their clients as chet boltwood correctly identified decades ago there is a significant difference between the obligation of a registered investment advisor and a broker or other managers  these nonfiduciary advisors are salespeople and like all salespeople they are paid to pitch and ultimately sell a product or service  they have no legal obligation to offer objective advice or act in the best interest of their client here at boltwood capital management we are proud to be a fiduciary
