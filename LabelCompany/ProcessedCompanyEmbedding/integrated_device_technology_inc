a complete reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures all financial references will be nongaap on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise indicated also we have made selected financial information available on webcast live which can be found in the investor relation section of our website now ill turn the call over to greg who will provide fourth quarter highlights and then ill return to give you more specifics on our results for the quarter after that ill elaborate on our outlook for the june quarter greg gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc thank you brian were very pleased to report a strong finish to our fiscal  and even stronger start to fiscal  in particular we believe that the second half of our fiscal  represents the beginning of a major idt product upgrade cycle of sustainable growth driven by market share gains across most of our major product lines revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter totaled  million which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance this was driven by increased sales of our wireless power memory interface and automotive sensor products on a nongaap basis our gross margin was  and our operating margin was  turning now to our major end markets theres now clear progress toward our strategy to increase both vertical market share gains and to simultaneously broaden our customer diversification to establish ourselves as the next industry leader in broadbased diversified analog mixedsignal solutions ill start with our automotive and industrial end market where sales increased by  sequentially to reach  of our total company revenue we are delivering on growth from a number of new automotive program ramps and market share gains with new products for safety emissions control and environmental sensing from a new product innovation perspective we also launched a fullyautomotive qualified family of position sensors with our superior that are superior in their immunity to interference even when used in a noisy automotive or industrial environment these new sensors will be used in a wide variety of transportation robotics and smart automation applications we continue to accelerate crossselling of our automotive and more traditional idt product lines and our outlook is to continue to gain market share and grow this business throughout this year in our cloud computing or data center market segment revenue increase by  sequentially to represent  of total company sales as we indicated last quarter demand is gradually improving with the bias towards the second half of our fiscal year coinciding with the market adoption of intels next generation skylake processor technology we remain very optimistic about current trends in this market in data storage macro trends in general these include an increasingly favorable competitive landscape and the adoption of increasing idt content as we continue to strengthen our leadership position were exceptionally well positioned to benefit from the ramp of skylake class processors when it occurs beyond dram memory interconnect such as ddr were now at the early stages of clearly delivering to our strategy of providing complete system solutions for ultrahigh performance memory interconnect this expands our market opportunity significantly and includes the following elements first our continued industry leadership in dram memory interface and extending that to new standards such as ddr second our new nonvolatile memory interface such as nvdimm and storage class memories third our advanced power management tailored for memory applications and finally something we havent spoken about before which are new proprietary memory interconnect products for certain cloud data center customers the first of these products will provide ultrahighspeed interface devices for highend cloud applications and will enter early production shipments late this fiscal year separately the acquisition of gigpeak was closed on april  and were already seeing strong customer interest in crossselling opportunities with their optical products weve been very successful in establishing idt as a major player in rf an advanced timing for communications infrastructure and data centers and our tier  customers have been encouraging us to enter this market for some time this is a positive financial transaction very quickly and we believe that meaningful revenue growth will result from these products under our brand and channel in our communications infrastructure end market revenue represented  of total company sales in the quarter and declined by  sequentially while communications segment revenues are typically seasonably down in the march quarter last quarter was down more than usual this was specifically due to the burnoff of inventory from a major chinese customer who had increased strategic inventory in the december quarter driven from concerns about trade restrictions placed on another company earlier in the year they are now proceeding to work those levels down which we believe will be easily complete in the june quarter separately we are delivering considerable strength in market share gains of our network timing products and our communications segment revenue is expected to be up in the june quarter as a result in our consumer end market revenue grew by  sequentially and represented  of total company sales this strength was due primarily to the successful launches of samsungs s and lgs g devices as well as a new additional japanese smartphone oem in addition to handset deployments we saw increased traction in automotive wireless power with new designins in both european and chinese oems this quarter for the first time were seeing a notable surge in customer interest to apply wireless power to industrial applications particularly when coupled with our advanced sensor technology we believe our smartphonebased business will grow nicely this year and by next year well see the start of meaningful diversification of this technology into automotive and industrial applications now moving to our q fiscal  guidance for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect revenue to come in at approximately  million plus or minus  million which includes  million from gigpeak gigpeak revenue will be divided between our computing communications and industrial end markets on an annual basis we expect the gigpeak mix to be approximately  computing  communications and  industrial with the inclusion of gigpeak revenue into our computing segment we expect this segment to be up approximately  sequentially excluding gigpeak computing revenue is expected to be relatively flat this type of slight pause before a new processor architecture is completely normal were very confident in a stronger second fiscal half as skylake becomes more widely adopted revenue in our communications end market is expected to be up by approximately  million or  with advanced timing products gaining market share resumption of rf business growth and the addition of gigpeak revenue as i mentioned earlier this segment will be up without gigpeak revenue as well consumer is expected to be up by  million or  million or approximately  from the prior quarter as we see increased proliferation of wireless power and to a wide variety of applications our automotive and industrial segment is expected to increase by approximately  as we continue to ramp new products in this new segment and add in the industrial revenue of gigpeak in summary our ability to leverage differentiated analog mixed signal technologies across vertical end markets such as cloud data centers or automotive and industrial with broad market adoption of our sensors timing and wireless power platforms give us an extremely positive starting point as we enter fiscal  we believe that idt is in position to capture meaningful growth over an extended period coupled with the exceptional leverage inherent in our business model before i turn the call back to brian to discuss our financials id also like to formally welcome chris allexandre who joined us recently as our senior executive leading our sales and marketing team chris joined us from nxp where he was senior vice president of mass market sales and before that was svp and head of sales with fairchild and prior to that led an accomplished career at texas instruments in addition im pleased to announce that mario montana who previously led our sales team but had a long career at idt as a business unit manager prior to that has relocated to germany to run our automotive and industrial business as we continue to build our team and infrastructure for accelerating growth in closing were entering fiscal  with a very positive momentum and very consistent with the longterm strategy that we communicated at our analyst day earlier in the year ill now turn it over to brian for further detail on the company financials brian c white  integrated device technology inc thanks greg as greg mentioned revenue for fiscal q was  million or  above the midpoint of our prior guidance q nongaap gross margin of  was  basis points below the midpoint of our guidance range due to product mix the main drivers of mix impact were lower communications revenue and higher wireless power revenue than previously forecasted nongaap operating expense was  million or  of revenue of that rd expense was approximately  million and sga  million operating expense was approximately  lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance driven by continued expense management favorable operating expense offset lower gross margin to deliver q nongaap operating margin of  which was equal to our guidance midpoint nongaap net interest and other income was  while our nongaap tax provision was approximately  or  of pretax income on our prior earnings call we noted that we were evaluating recent changes to withholding tax laws in malaysia a potential impact to our business we are happy to report that we have finished that process and concluded that there is no material impact to idt nor is there any related change to our prior shortterm or longterm forecast for idt cash tax rate for fiscal q we reported nongaap net income of  million or  per diluted share next ill summarize our result on a gaap basis we reported fiscal q gaap net income from continuing operations of  million or  per diluted share the difference between our gaap and nongaap results nets out to about  million or  per diluted share fiscal q gaap results include  million in stockbased compensation  million in acquisition and restructuring charges  million in noncash interest expense and  million in related tax benefits further information including the detailed reconciliation of gaap to nongaap results is provided in the financial tables of todays press release it can also be found on our website at idtcom ill turn to our balance sheet and cash flow cash and shortterm investments increased  million to  million we generated  million in cash from operations and spent approximately  million on capex free cash flow for the quarter was approximately  million and free cash flow as a percent of revenue was  on a trailing fourquarter basis we expect free cash flow to improve materially as we progress through fiscal  on higher profitability and a substantial reduction in restructuring cost on our share buyback program we spent  million to repurchase  shares at an average price of  net inventory increased  million and days of inventory increased from  to  days to support new product ramps and increasing demand dso increased from  days to  days primarily due to shipment linearity in the quarter now expand on our forecast for the june quarter greg noted that we currently project revenues for our fiscal  first quarter to be between  million and  million or  million at the midpoint the june quarter guidance includes  million related to the gigpeak acquisition net of estimated purchase accounting adjustment of approximately  million at our analyst day in february we presented a longterm revenue growth model that included approximately  million of revenue for fiscal year  with an annual growth rate of  to  per year thereafter we expect that gigpeak will add approximately  million to  million to the current year which would increase the fiscal year  model to be approximately  million with  to  of future annual revenue growth off that new higher base for fiscal q we project nongaap gross margin to increase  basis points sequentially to reach approximately  plus or minus  percentage point driven by change in product mix increased communications revenue and the addition of gigpeak are the primary drivers of the quarteroverquarter improvement for cost reduction initiatives and product mix our objective is to improve gross margins to meet or exceed the high end of our previously stated target model of  to  in the second half of this fiscal year on our last earnings call we said that opex before the addition of gigpeak would increase to the  million to  million per quarter range in fiscal  primarily from the reset of variable compensation accruals to  after a year in which we felt short of our internal revenue and margin objective consistent with that we project that total opex before the addition gigpeak will be  million in the june quarter we project that gigpeak will add an additional  million therefore total opex for the quarter is projected to be  million plus or minus  million rd is forecasted to be  million and sga  million fiscal q nongaap operating margin is estimated to be approximately  at the midpoint of our guidance range our current target is to reach  operating margin in the second half of this fiscal year for both the total company and for the gigpeak business we currently anticipate fiscal q interest and other expense will be approximately  million this includes interest expense on the  million acquisitionrelated term loan which carries a rate of libor plus  basis points our fiscal q forecast for idts nongaap tax rate  which is consistent with our prior outlook of  for base idt plus a  point increase for the gigpeak acquisition we estimate q share count will be about  million shares on a fully diluted basis based on the midpoint of our guidance range we project nongaap eps for the june quarter to be between  and  or  at the midpoint in summary we have increasing confidence in the strength of our growth engines particularly in the second half of fiscal  and we have the opportunity to resume both strong sequential and yearoveryear revenue growth with accelerating earnings with that ill turn the call over to the operator for the qa portion of call questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time well take our first question this will be from harlan sur with jpmorgan harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution intel talked about ramping skylake middle of this year there does appear to be quite a bit of pentup demand from all segments of the compute value chain high performance computing data center and even looks like enterprise i know you guys are probably qualified or being qualified it seems like some of the hyperscalers are getting early shipments of skylake so im surprised that youre not seeing growth in q but does this mean that your memory interface business is just going to see a more meaningful stepup in the calendar second half of this year gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc it does mean that it will be a more meaningful stepup certainly in the fiscal half of the second year as well but harlan where we are is were fully qualified on everything in other words there are no outstanding actions on our part for product readiness anywhere so as skylake ships we will ship along with it and our position could not be better right to take advantage of that ramp so its not our place to comment on another companys ramp we leave that to intel but we are shipping skylakerelated product we have been for some time i think weve mentioned that a couple of calls ago that we had begun production deliveries but in terms of when that actual crossover point and meaningful ramp comes we see that more as a second half of our fiscal year event operator this time we will move to vivek arya with bank of america merrill lynch adam gonzalez  bank of america merrill lynch hi this is adam gonzalez on for vivek thanks for taking my question you mentioned some inventory in the comms business thats been built up by one particular customer just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on that can you quantify how much inventory is left how much is the – a little bit deeper into off  by june gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah no were not going to get into that level of detail but its a very focused strategic – it was purposeful on their part it is a major chinese oem and longtime tier  customer of idt who had elected to build up some strategic inventory not due to us but because of concerns about trade actions at that time this was primarily in our rf product section for instance that inventory is already being drained off we see it very clearly because we see whats being pulled out of largely consignment at this point and are extremely confident that that is completely done i would say by the end of this quarter adam gonzalez  bank of america merrill lynch thanks gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah operator we will now move to quinn bolton with needham  company quinn bolton  needham  co llc hey guys just wanted to ask your thoughts on the potential for samsung or any other large wireless charging customers to potentially insource that product and then second as you look out at the opex for the rest of fiscal  brian you mentioned that were going to see a stepup in variable expenses in q kind of wondering whether that holds flat beyond q or do you see sort of some roll off of those variable expenses as you get into later quarters in the fiscal year thanks gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah ill take the first question quinn and turn over to brian for the second we wake up every day being hungry and paranoid about securing future business and our products were always vigilant on that but i would say our outlook in wireless power across all of our major companies including samsung for this cycle is extremely robust we are very confident in our competitive position there id say there was a bubble of news and reports around this a few weeks back which created i think somewhat of a stir that is not new news at all to us in other words its completely nonnews on that so id reflect that we are quite confident in our position in this product cycle and the second part brian brian c white  integrated device technology inc yeah hey quinn on your question regarding opex you did see a stepup in our fiscal q for the reasons that we talked about in terms of how to think about that for the rest of the fiscal year i would model that relatively flat in the range of approximately  million to  million a quarter quinn bolton  needham  co llc thank you gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc okay thanks quinn operator at this time well hear from harsh kumar with stephens harsh v kumar  stephens inc yeah hey guys i think you might have answered part of my question so second half i think brian you mentioned youre expecting to go back to  operating margins and i wanted to get at some of the two or three of the top levers that youre going to be able to pull one obviously sounds like growth it seems like youre not taking a shot at the opex that much so what would be some of the other areas that you are very excited about in the back half brian c white  integrated device technology inc yeah harsh its really two things one were going to keep the opex relatively flat we believe but revenue growth looks very strong in the second half relative to what we can see today and in combination with that we think that theres an opportunity for gross margin expansion so were guiding here a little over  in our prepared remarks we talked about an objective of getting to the highend of our model which is – highend of that model with  or exceed that in the second half of fiscal year so its really two things its revenue growth and its gross margin expansion harsh v kumar  stephens inc thanks gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc and to add on to that harsh with respect to the gross margin expansion heres one perspective thats happening all over in the company is if you take the time it takes to go from a new product idea starting development to extracting first revenue it really takes three years so the investments that we made in  with many many new product sets were now starting to just beginning to capture revenue with all of those new products across those product lines and their gross margins are higher than the ones that they replace harsh v kumar  stephens inc thanks gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yep operator well now move to edward snyder with charter equity research edward snyder  charter equity research thanks brian you said gm expansion in the second half of the year is part of your plan to get your operating margin to  and i imagine a lot of thats going to be mix can you give us some idea other than memory because obviously memory is going to be in the second year  what product shifts do you expect to help you on mix in the second half of the year and greg if i could on the wireless charging just kind of whipsawed you guys around on the press  line anyway not so much on the revenue line and i know you said for a long time that once apple releases the wireless charging product in their phones it seems like its going to be this year theres a lot of oems that will follow – that have been waiting to release to see which way apple would break if they in fact do a custom solution as many are expecting to do why should we expect the oems that follow them to break that way also and since you didnt want the apple business because it was custom and something you couldnt catalog should we expect that some of the other oems you wouldnt be chasing either because of the same reason gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah let me kind of do those in reverse orders first with respect to wireless power heres what i think gives us confidence about the wireless power what large companies like the one you mentioned do or dont do is certainly beyond our control we grow that business just fine without any new infusion from anybody so if you look at kind of the – just extrapolating from where we are that business just does fine now if theres other announcements later this year that cause other suppliers to get more busy in wireless power thats very great for us were in a superior position to capitalize on that but since its hard to forecast for everybody including us we suggest that that doesnt need to get into the model so in other words the  to  model that brian is talking about going into next year does not assume right nor depend on any major upside in wireless power right so i think the range of outcomes for us is from good to great but were just not largely dependent on what any one oem might or might not do the second thing with respect to our aversion towards doing undifferentiated custom asics that will remain in this market segment and pretty much all others we can capture business otherwise now before i get into – we get into the rest of your questions i just want to make sure i corrected something i thought you said  with a  in front of it for operating margins we said  with a  and i may have heard you incorrectly but if thats the case i wanted to correct that edward snyder  charter equity research no i tried to move your guidance up for you but that didnt work gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc okay well we appreciate it on that but with respect to product mix and if you take a look at the overall product mix youve seen an increase in the overall gross margin performance i believe almost without exception from almost every major idt product line right so theres not as much variance theres not a whole lot of variance in those product lines from what we had before but certainly comms tends to lead for us in gross margins and we do see some healthy market share gains going on even independent or not even counting on comms market growth in the second half of the year in a nutshell if you take a look at our two leading products in comms for instance which will be radio frequency and advanced timing the timing business was very penetrated into european and north american providers theyre very underpenetrated in asia radio frequency exactly the opposite and both of those product lines gain share where they were not as we move into the second half of the fiscal year edward snyder  charter equity research great thank you gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yep operator this time well move to charlie anderson with dougherty  company charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc yeah thanks for taking my questions i wonder if you guys could rank order because it looks like were going to have a pretty big jump from the first half to the back half in absolute dollars which categories maybe the top three that you think will contribute to that and then ive got a followup gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc well i think certainly memory interface weighs up there charlie in terms of breaking the other ones like im not going to rank them but ill – if you take a look at even the results were currently getting we think that most if not all of the major product lines are growing gain share in the second half of the year so the memory interface area obviously timing broadly rf broadly automotive and industrial broadly which is already putting some good growth and just to put it in perspective if youll all recall the first quarter after we had purchased zmdi that would be in the march quarter of  the revenue in that entire business was approximately  million thats from memory so you want to crosscheck me on that but thats about right and then the quarter that we just concluded that was meaningfully higher than that in the high s million right so we are already even without the benefit – which will accelerate with the benefit of new product racking up some decent growth out of that segment as well so id say that growth is very broad based and not in fact reliant on just one or two things charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc okay perfect and then you did make a mention in your prepared remarks about a proprietary memory interface for a cloud customer i wonder if you maybe just expand on that opportunity and is that one customer or is that multiple customers thank you gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah at this point is one customer and likely to become more im not at liberty to give a lot of details about it but as one of the – what we strive for in our solutions is not just to be a chip supplier but an architectural provider to our key customers so this is a very major cloud data provider who has decided in this case to do a very specialty form of their own memory modules and we will be supplying the exclusive memory interface which is a nonstate of memory interface as part of that charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc great thanks so much gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yep operator well now move to blayne curtis from barclays blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question greg just wanted to followup im not sure i understood the answer to the prior question on wireless charging so youre currently in the samsung version so i guess i was trying to figure out what you meant by what not news is and then maybe you just broadly as you go to the consumer into the next fiscal year whether you think that business can grow gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yes i do think it can grow into next year is the answer to the first one what i was referring to blayne is there was a report issued a few weeks ago that raised concerns about samsung insourcing wireless power towards samsung lsi division their internal division and my comment was exactly this theres no surprise nor news to us about our position relative to any competitor including samsungs internal and i was projecting confidence in terms of our product position for at least the rest of this product cycle with samsung blayne curtis  barclays capital inc okay yeah i think the call was that itd be in a future generation but you still feel like you could grow your consumer revenue next year gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc i do in fact when we talk about – i do and listen we have now carried a significant majority of the samsung wireless power business for two full generations which is very unusual and considering that idt wasnt even on the approved vendor list of companies like samsung not long ago which its a real credit to the team when we put forward in future years company growth of  to  we assume that we will not have this type of almost  share at samsung at some point in the future and if we end up with that itll be an upside blayne curtis  barclays capital inc perfect thanks for the clarification gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yep operator well now move to suji de silva with roth capital suji de silva  roth capital partners llc hi greg hi brian so on automotive its grown pretty nicely here and youve talked about it at the analyst day  to  growth above the corporate average can you talk about the visibility into the programs that help that ramp and how far that visibility extends for you guys to keep the mix growing there gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc the visibility to program ramps across the company is very high because if you take a look at the great majority of our products theyre solesourced or at least meaningful now memory interface would be an exception so theres always one more source on that maybe not at the same point in time but if you look at the rest of the analog and mixedsignal portfolio key customers really depend on us for these products so while theres no perfect forecast our visibility in new program ramps i would say is very high suji de silva  roth capital partners llc okay thanks guys operator well now move to chris rolland with susquehanna christopher rolland  susquehanna financial group lllp hey guys thanks for the question has increasing memory prices affect your market at all and then outside of market pricing is there perhaps a change in workloads or dynamics that could actually increase the lrdimm attach rate from here gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah were not calling an increase to lrdimm attach rate so we dont see that i wouldnt factor it – its not in our thinking right now the broad answer to your question is probably not do we see an increase at a very very high level maybe chris because dram prices are definitely up that means that there is more motivation for the dram manufacturers to put capacity and ship those drams where as last year it might have been lower this indirectly helps our memory interface since wed still be a lot more out of dram than anything else but i mean this is a second order effect or a third christopher rolland  susquehanna financial group lllp great and if you could talk about any changes in your market you mentioned ddr perhaps we can talk about that and then also as we move from four channels to six channels here i know youve talked about – i think youve said in the past revenue perhaps up  or  there why not  is there an expectation that people wont fill all those slots how do you think about ddr and then the fill rate per server gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc i think ddr is sufficiently far in the future its just not relevant to the nearterm investor case i mean its something that we are investing heavily in i expect to have a very commanding lead in that standard as well but if you take a look at the ddr area chris its years in the future i mean this is – this year is id say first prototyping work in the industry theres jedec standards that need to be resolved for this sort of thing and then youve got a – i mean ddr will be a major memory architectural shift at a time when even microarchitectures like skylake are just beginning to get out of the box on this so its going to be a great opportunity it will bring increased memory content tam for people like ourselves but this is a years out christopher rolland  susquehanna financial group lllp great and on the four to six channels how do you see it – how do you gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc i think thats too detailed for an investor call chris thats sort of the dialogue i defer to you guys but in general memory content will gradually increase as it already has christopher rolland  susquehanna financial group lllp great thanks operator well now move back to blayne curtis with barclays blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey thanks for letting me ask another i was just curious brian the tax rate  is that the goforward tax rate and then if you could just – whats the gaap reconciliation charge is going to be from the deal brian c white  integrated device technology inc so prior to the gig acquisition we had forecasted  for base idt and that remains intact gig layer is on  point with an underlying assumption that the income generated by gig is basically – its something close to a full us tax rate so thats how you get to the  and yes we would expect the  to prevail for probably two or three years as we have previously expected the  to be in place for a number of years as well over the very long haul that will gradually creep up to low single digits all in the absence of any changes that could impact out from us tax reform blayne curtis  barclays capital inc and then just the added amortization from the deal brian c white  integrated device technology inc i dont have that number right in front of me blayne curtis  barclays capital inc yeah thanks operator well now move to harlan sur with jpmorgan harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks for taking my followup i wanted to focus on enterprise ssd your largest customer which i think is the largest enterprise ssd supplier globally they drove nice quarteronquarter growth i think their business was up  yearoveryear in march just wondering if you guys are tracking along the same growth trajectory and although we all know that theres tightness in nand supply enterprise ssd continues to be the fastest growing segment within that market is this going to be one of the drivers also in the second half of your fiscal year gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc we are tracking harlan good question and specifically this is on the full ssd side so for us the content changes a little bit there its no longer memory interface to do well its more of the very smart power management type sockets weve got on that now that business is up yearonyear i think were looking up to see the tracks in the quarter on that but yes that business does increase nicely this year so that business right now is a very differentiated very high margin and sticky business but still pretty nichey in terms of its relatively small size it is starting to get some growth traction and the real opportunity in that harlan is further customer adoption and more sku adoption as we go forward now right now even though its difficult to forecast and we have encouraged people to keep it out of their models we do expect to have the second tier  ssd vendor in production with that same class of technology by the very end of this fiscal year its difficult even for us to know how much of that we get in the march quarter or not but customer number two we do believe enters this fiscal year harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yep operator well now move to harsh kumar with stephens harsh v kumar  stephens inc yeah hey thanks for the opportunity for a followup question a couple of them actually greg if you dont mind you dont have to give us a number or anything like that but if you dont mind telling us how the wireless charging business performed in the march quarter it should have been up i think that was the expectation quite a bit and then what is your expectation sequentially in the june quarter for that business or just colorwise how do you want us to look at that business then ive got one or two more gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah it was up quite a bit harsh in the march – go ahead brian c white  integrated device technology inc yeah harsh brian so wireless charging in the march quarter was approximately  million and we see that growing into the june quarter gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yep harsh v kumar  stephens inc hey guys thanks for putting a number on that that helps a lot for modeling and then greg would you just talk about for memory interface for skylake do you see an asp increase or do you see content increase or do you see both gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc you see at least an asp increase and this would be common in the industry so if you get another major revision such as skylake asps do reset and that is meaningful now on content this is back to kind of the early question is how do cloud data centers really provision memory with skylake do they use more memory channels does this enter into more dimms being used the answer is probably but its not crystal clear to anybody exactly how that goes so its at least an asp reset and possibly theres some content gains as well but thats harder to call harsh v kumar  stephens inc fair enough thank you and then one last one and i promise ill move away you mentioned you expect your comm business to snapback primarily because i think some of the inventory that was built up gets burned off i assume that is serial rapidio business mostly correct gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc no that was mostly rf business harsh actually this is not serial rapidio it was mostly radiofrequency and theres kind of two things so our march quarter comms performance was weaker than seasonality would imply certainly weaker than that thats the strategic buildup and the reason im very confident about that being burnt off is we see exactly what they are pulling out of inventory most of this is consignment and its already almost burned off right so thats about as high confidence as we can get that that comes back in addition and running counter to that we are definitely gaining share with advanced timing and comms infrastructure and that is growing nicely despite that so thats where we sit on comms harsh v kumar  stephens inc thanks thanks greg operator well now move to edward snyder with charter equity research edward snyder  charter equity research thanks greg the auto business grew  that is still very robust i was just trying to get a feel i know weve talked a lot in the past about idt crossselling some of your sensors into auto versus just organic growth which was i think around  when you bought zmdi although they were smaller how is that playing out now i know the pipeline for auto was so much longer than most of your other businesses but is idt still getting a lot of traction with sensors if you kind of played out with that is that going to become an increasingly large portion of the story and how is the margin profile on those products versus similarly organic products coming out of zmdi gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc yeah thank you ed the traction of sensors specifically we put a stake in the ground even though that sensor business is small for us today we intend to emerge as a market leader in sensors in years to come and its a big deal over here and we think weve got the technology and the early traction to go do that so the migration of sensor technology is mainly from the automotive group into industrial and other segments so youll see – for instance this position sensor that we just had announced recently thats a very differentiated fullposition sensing technology that gives a very precise location you can use on a robot arm you can use it in automotive it actually does not require a magnet as most computing solutions do so its very immune to interference or – and you would know this well ed electromagnetic interference so thats an example of a sensor we didnt have a year ago so youll see a lot more from us on sensors and the gross margins are at least as good as the company average is right now these industrial businesses as you all know take a long time to build up so the design win funnel is extremely robust were getting design wins all over to the point where were actually starting to shift our sales coverage to better serve some of these middletier customers and we remain very bullish on it now with respect to the core automotive business we are getting terrific crossselling of classic idt products like wireless power and other things into automotive in fact ahead of what we expected a year ago edward snyder  charter equity research and then could you remind us real quick on the d xpoint stuff that intel is working on and now shipping some of it idti provides products to that just i know this is the first installment that theyve just started now that is your lower content product and then follow on next year when they get some of the nonvolatile stuff out you have a significantly higher content on that or do you expect to be same or do you even know yet gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc no we do know exactly and it will be a significantly higher content yeah and let me be perfectly clear on this because i want to have complete transparency about how we see the likely future trajectory of our business and business growth so when we talk about  to  growth in the future for instance after this year weve also identified that therere a fairly large handful of what we call lottery tickets that are not in the model so in other words since these are inherently hard to predict we encourage people to keep them out of the model but they would actually be upsides potentially to that  to  now d xpoint as well as what we call storage class memories are one of those theyre not in the model and theyre very hard to predict lidar which weve announced a number of very advanced developments and rapid traction on full sensors were really not baking a lot of sensor success that we may actually get into the   automotive pmic which is one of the best crossselling activities that weve had successfully starting last year non – wireless power and different things it just kind of goes on millimeter wave which we had talked about and are now actually sampling in different customer bases is another one so the handful of what i call option cards weve got right now is getting interesting edward snyder  charter equity research great thanks operator well take a question from quinn bolton with needham and company quinn bolton  needham  co llc hey brian just wanted to ask you had mentioned the acquisition of gigpeak will add  million of revenue to the june quarter but you said something to the effect of net of  million just wondering is that a sort of exclusion of the video compression software that you cant recognize or is there some other factor going on just hoping for a little bit more detail on what that  million comment meant brian c white  integrated device technology inc yeah quinn generally youre going to have some amount of revenue in an acquisition that gets lost in the ether associated with things like deferred revenue royalty contracts nre contracts and so on so its a combination of those types of things i think youll generally see that in the acquisition so the majority of that would hit in the first quarter its possible there is  or  that would hit us next quarter something like that and then that should be the total amount quinn bolton  needham  co llc got it thank you brian c white  integrated device technology inc you bet operator and that concludes that qa session ill turn things back over to ceo greg waters for closing remarks gregory l waters  integrated device technology inc right thank you operator and thank you everybody for attending we look forward to meeting with many of you over the next quarter later in may well be participating at the jpmorgan tmt conference in boston the craighallum conference in minneapolis and in early june well be in san francisco for the bank

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
