found it 👏 talk 📱 products herman miller eames chair  i have craigslist alerts for eames chairs when i stop moving and sort of settle down i’m going to get the lounge chair i just need to find one with the ottoman too i’m not truly relaxed if i can’t have my feet up the kindle  i was resistant to make the switch away from actual books but it turns out the kindle really is all it’s cracked up to be my favorite part about it is that it doesn’t feel like an actual screen which is one of the many reasons why i enjoy reading it’s good to take a break from the screen ❔ whois i’ve worked in startup land since before going to art school at uconn to concentrate in communication design the combination of art school while learning on the job proved to be quite helpful and i stayed at my first job for over  years before moving on to automattic when i’m not working on improving woocommerce i’m outside either snowboarding or mountain biking i also enjoy traveling netflixing and visiting my family
