sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of ibms computer sales the company made little profit on these sales but as tom jr said it enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else and to train thousands of new workers in electronicscitation needed tom jrs decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune magazine called ibms  billion gamble in the end paid off organizational structuresedit perhaps watsons most enduring contribution to ibm was its organizational structure since new products no matter how successful carry a company for at most a few years in  in a move that became a biannual event he reorganized ibm on divisional lines to give a decentralized organization with five major divisions in the us the new structure comprised data processing division — selling to and servicing commercial customers federal systems division — selling to and servicing the us government systems manufacturing division components manufacturing division research division smaller units were electric typewriter ibm world trade service bureau corporation supplies division and time division sold off in  watson said we had a superb sales organization but lacked expert management organization in almost everything elsecitation needed his goal was to redirect ibm to absorb the shocks of change including change from its own innovation he introduced the terminology line and staffcitation needed in his words by the mids just about every big corporation had adopted the socalled staffandline structure it was modeled on military organizations going back to the prussian army in napoleonic timescitation needed his organization  provided ibm executives with the clearest possible goals each operating man was judged strictly on his units results and each staff man on his effort toward making ibm the world leader in his specialtycitation needed the final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in armonk new york this was said by him to be in order to be near his family he lived in connecticut where taxes were lower but kept his staff across the border in new york state so it has been suggested that ibm would not be seen as similarly evading taxes cynics said it was his fear of nuclear warfare he owned a fallout sheltercitation needed his first book in  discussed his management philosophy honorsedit watson received the silver buffalo award from the boy scouts of america in  for his service to youth he was the national president of the bsa from  to  his father had also served on the national executive board and was international commissioner in the s lyndon b johnson in september

americas nuclear defense policy he was an avid sailor and pilot he named  successive sailboats after palawan the last in  watson sailed his sailboat palawan further up the northern coast of greenland than any nonmilitary ship had done previously for which he won the new york yacht clubs highest award and the cruising club of americas blue water medal he traveled the route of captain cook in

time zones of the soviet union a route he had previously done as a pilot ferrying general bradley in a jet he piloted himself watson had homes in greenwich connecticut north haven maine stowe vermont

university  see also  references  further reading  external links early lifeedit thomas watson jr was born on january   just before his father was dismissed from his job at ncr then two sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of ibms computer sales the company made little profit on these sales but as tom jr said it enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else and to train thousands of new workers in electronicscitation needed tom jrs decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune magazine called ibms  billion gamble in the end paid off organizational structuresedit perhaps watsons most enduring contribution to ibm was its organizational structure since new products no matter how successful carry a company for at most a few years in  in a move that became a biannual event he reorganized ibm on divisional lines to give a decentralized organization with five major divisions in the us the new structure comprised data processing division — selling to and servicing commercial customers federal systems division — selling to and servicing the us government systems manufacturing division components manufacturing division research division smaller units were electric typewriter ibm world trade service bureau corporation supplies division and time division sold off in  watson said we had a superb sales organization but lacked expert management organization in almost everything elsecitation needed his goal was to redirect ibm to absorb the shocks of change including change from its own innovation he introduced the terminology line and staffcitation needed in his words by the mids just about every big corporation had adopted the socalled staffandline structure it was modeled on military organizations going back to the prussian army in napoleonic timescitation needed his organization  provided ibm executives with the clearest possible goals each operating man was judged strictly on his units results and each staff man on his effort toward making ibm the world leader in his specialtycitation needed the final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in armonk new york this was said by him to be in order to be near his family he lived in connecticut where taxes were lower but kept his staff across the border in new york state so it has been suggested that ibm would not be seen as similarly evading taxes cynics said it was his fear of nuclear warfare he owned a fallout sheltercitation needed his first book in  discussed his management philosophy honorsedit watson received the silver buffalo award from the boy scouts of america in  for his service to youth he was the national president of the bsa from  to  his father had also served on the national executive board and was international commissioner in the s lyndon b johnson in september

union serving from october   to january   prior to this service he was the chairman of the general advisory committee gac which was set up by president kennedy to give advice to the president about americas nuclear defense policy he was an avid sailor and pilot he named  successive sailboats after palawan the last in  watson sailed his sailboat palawan further up the northern coast of greenland than any nonmilitary ship had done previously for which he won the new york yacht clubs highest award and the cruising club of americas blue water medal he traveled the route of captain cook in exploring the pacific he flew aircraft from helicopters and jets to stunt planes and he was the first private citizen to receive permission from soviet premier mikhail gorbachev in  to fly to all the time zones of the soviet union a route he had previously done as a pilot ferrying general bradley in a jet he piloted himself watson had homes in greenwich connecticut north haven maine stowe vermont

decision was justified in the longer term it redirected ibm to its later position dominating the computer market even in the short term it paid off for revenues more than tripled in six years from  million in  to  million in  this dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years a better than  compound growth rate that tom jr maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of ibm it was a record even better than that of his father despite the presence of his son thomas sr kept a firm grip on the reins until  tom jr described the position of his father as he wanted to make me head of ibm but he didnt like sharing the limelight tom jr took over effective control in a dramatic moment though the formal handover took place a few months later the occasion was signing the consent decree which was offered by the government after its latest antitrust investigation tom jr saw that the consent decree which sought to strip ibm of half its cardmaking capacity was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers not cards there was another condition ibm had to sell machines outright as well as lease them this had repercussions in the late s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created behind this decision was another spending more on research and development ibm was only spending  on research and development when other high technology companies were spending between  and  tom jr learned the lesson and thereafter — at least until the s when even then gerstner only dropped it to  — ibm consistently spent  by comparison the equivalent figure for japan was  though its high technology companies exceeded even the ibm level with the  spending for canon being  and that for nec being  this training program was to take him over the next five years through many of ibms operating groups tom jr believed his most important influence was albert lynn williams a cpa who became president of ibm in  although the initiative and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution must go to tom jr considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who despite his long commitment to internal funding backed his son to the hilt reportedly with the words it is harder to keep a business great than it is to build itcitation needed research and developmentedit of the two brothers tom jr made the most obvious impact on ibm as a whole while dick ran the international business prior to his time ibm had primarily emphasized the sales organization with a reasonable range of products tom jr however promoted the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry it was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up to a point where in the late s they contained nobel prize winners and to the point where the research and development function could stand on an equal footing with marketing true to his original objective when tom jr started this process in  ibm was reportedly two years behind its main competitor univac in the s it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area this was not so obvious to the outside world because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the s and pursued very profitably until recently despite the hype about prereleasing products which did not yet exist only when the market was sufficiently developed and a launch was financially justifiable did ibm commit its marketing resources in the labs though they were able to plan speculatively for the future decades in advance independent and untroubled by commercial demands it was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher and highly productive for ibm the first result of this was the ibm  stretch program to develop a transistorized supercomputer a hundred times more powerful than the vacuum tube  it failed to meet its price and performance goals at a reported cost of  million although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world it would not however be the last ibm computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in ibms terms and the experience gained was invaluable one of ibms strengths was that until the s it really did learn from experience most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes and never use the invaluable information they have gained ibm however made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons the three computer families that eventually emerged from  onwards comprised the ibm  and ibm  for large government business the ibm  for the scientific community and the ibm  for commercial use despite the fact that many observers believed that tom jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up these new ranges were remarkably successful doubling ibms sales once more over the six years from   billion to   billion maintaining ibms dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching  compound the effect was that ibm had become independent of outside funding in the early s he oversaw the ibm system project which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals since the  line was incompatible with ibms previous products it represented an enormous risk for the company despite delays in shipment the products were wellreceived following their launch in  and what fortune magazine called ibms  billion gamble in the end paid off organizational structuresedit perhaps watsons most enduring contribution to ibm was its organizational structure since new products no matter how successful carry a company for at most a few years in  in a move that became a biannual event he reorganized ibm on divisional lines to give a decentralized organization with five major divisions in the us the new structure comprised

organization but lacked expert management organization in almost everything elsecitation needed his goal was to redirect ibm to absorb the shocks of change including change from its own innovation he introduced the terminology line and staffcitation needed in his words by the mids just about every big corporation had adopted the socalled staffandline structure it was modeled on military organizations going back to the prussian army in napoleonic timescitation needed his organization  provided ibm executives with the clearest possible goals each operating man was judged strictly on his units results and each staff man on his effort toward making ibm the world leader in his specialtycitation needed the final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in armonk new york this was said by him to be in order to be near his family he lived in connecticut where taxes were lower but kept his staff across the border in new york state so it has been suggested that ibm would not be seen as similarly evading taxes cynics said it was his fear of nuclear warfare he owned a fallout sheltercitation needed his first book in  discussed his

university  see also  references  further reading  external links early lifeedit thomas watson jr was born on january   just before his father was dismissed from his job at ncr then two sisters were born jane and helen before the youngest child arthur kittredge watson was born he was raised in the short hills section of millburn new jersey both sons were immersed in ibm from a very early age he was taken on plant inspections — his first memory of such a visit to the dayton ohio factory was at the age of five — business tours to europe and he made appearances at ibm hundred per cent club meetings annual gatherings for the companys elite sales representatives even before he was old enough to attend school at home his fathers discipline was erratic and often harsh around the time he was thirteen tom jr suffered for six years with what might now be called clinical depression talking to a reporter in  watson jr described his relationship with his father my father and i had terrible fights  he seemed like a blanket that covered everything i really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me but this relationship was not all negative i really enjoyed the ten years working with him in his book he says i was so intimately entwined with my father i had a compelling desire maybe out of honor for the old gentleman maybe out of sheer cussedness to prove to the world that i could excel in the same way that he didix watson jr attended the hun school of princeton in princeton new jersey he claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a strange defect in his vision that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them as a result watson struggled in school and he acknowledged that brown university reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father he obtained a business degree in  he married olive cawley – in  they had six children after graduating watson became a salesman for ibm but had little interest in the job the turning point was his service as a pilot in the army air force during world war ii brother dick arthur watson had dropped out of yale as a major in ordnance tom jr became a lieutenant colonel flying military commanders tom jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot piloting came easily to him and for the first time he had confidence in his abilities toward the end of his service watson worked for major general follett bradley who suggested that he should try to follow his father at ibm watson regularly flew bradley the director of lendlease programs to the soviet union to moscow during the war on these trips he learned russian which would later serve him well as the american ambassador to the soviet union watson returned to ibm at the beginning of  he was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that he became executive vicepresident in  ibm presidentedit watson became president of ibm in  and was named as the companys ceo shortly before his fathers death in  up to this time ibm was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products watson sr had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable except for oneofakind projects such as the ibm ssec tom jr took the company in a new direction hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers many of ibms technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential cuthbert hurd brought in from the atomic energy commissions oak ridge national laboratory to determine if there was a market predicted  he could find customers for as many as thirty machines even so until the late s the custombuilt us air force sage computerized
