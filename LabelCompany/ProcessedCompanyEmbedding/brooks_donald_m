my th pair and i will continue to buy them as long as they are available yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ i would buy this again   new jersey  runs like the wind performing as advertised lots of cushioning and spring yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ sleek design  just needs improved grip for the outsole   nyc  zac  everyday great aesthetics only qualm is the grip of the outsole specifically in wet weather conditions slightly less grip than a nb pair of shoes but aesthetically more pleasing yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ extremely comfortable shoe   pittsburgh pa  bucky i dont run but walk  to  miles a day this is the best shoe i have ever ownedi knew it the moment i tried them on yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ best running shoe i have ever owned   chicago  jms i suffer from shin splints and have tried other support shoes from competitors nothing compares to this shoe yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ great shoe   forney tx  donald the marine so light its almost like its not there tongue is a tad wider than the beast which i like yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ same great shoeonly snugger   rochester ny  goldy ive been wearing the adrenaline gts series for at least  years i use this running shoe for its versatility im not a runner but the great cushioning helps my knees and hips when i walk work or occasionally shoot hoops not play basketball just shoot hoops the only drawback to the  model is it seems a little snugger in length than previous versions but not enough to return for a larger size unless my feet grew which doesnt seem to be the case as my other footwear fit fine yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ happy overall   salem or  happy customer this shoe is really comfortable with a great deal of support the support is there without being overly corrective nice shoe the only thing i would change is the interior height of the shoe i could use a little more room in the middle of the shoe i struggle with toe pain and arch pain brooks is the only shoe that works for me yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ first time buying a real running shoe   minneapolis mn  erik the goat ive always enjoyed running but never invested in an actual running shoe until now it has held up well to running upwards of  miles a week and has been perfect for training for my first marathon fairly light while giving plenty of support looks good feels fast yes i would recommend this ★★★★★ ★★★★★ unbelievablely comfortable   dallas tx  dave h i took these on vacation with me because i knew i would be walking at least  miles a day on rough cobblestone roads they worked out better than i anticipated these are an excellent pair of shoes yes i would recommend this displaying reviews    next  donald
