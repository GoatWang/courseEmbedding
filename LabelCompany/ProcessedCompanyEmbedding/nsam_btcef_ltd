not issue or sell any senior security if immediately thereafter the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the funds may be prohibited by section c as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses  section i of the act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock applicants state that multiple classes of shares of the funds may violate section i of the act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely

company early withdrawal charges  section c of the act provides in relevant part that no registered closedend investment company shall purchase securities of which it is the issuer except a on a securities exchange or other open market b pursuant to tenders after reasonable opportunity to submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be purchased or c under other circumstances as the commission may permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of investors  rule c under the act permits a registered closedend investment company an “interval fund”

rule d the commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  rule d under the act provides an exemption from section d and rule d to permit openend investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule b under the act applicants request an order under section d and rule d under the act to the extent necessary to permit the fund to impose assetbased distribution andor service fees applicants have agreed to comply with rules b and d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a fund financing the distribution of its shares through assetbased distribution fees for the reasons stated above applicants submit that
