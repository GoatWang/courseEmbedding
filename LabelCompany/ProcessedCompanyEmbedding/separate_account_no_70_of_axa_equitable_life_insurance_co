the federal tax law definition of life insurance limits your ability to pay certain high levels of premiums in addition if your cumulative premium payments exceed certain amounts specified under the internal revenue code your policy will become a modified endowment contract mec if your policy is a mec the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment but you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the life of the insured you can ask your financial professional to provide you with an illustration of policy benefits that shows you the amount of premium you can pay based on various assumptions without exceeding these tax law limits what policies are grandfathered from becoming modified endowment contracts life insurance contracts entered into before june   are generally grandfathered from this premium limit test however certain changes made to the contract could invalidate the policys grandfathered status and subject it to premium limit testing what changes could cause a loss of grandfathered status a face amount increase the addition of a rider or an increase in its amount a reduction in rating a change to nonsmoker status or a substitution of insured are all considered material changes and could result in a loss of grandfathered status with the change a new pay period is started effective with the date of the transaction and a new pay premium is determined premiums will need to be limited to the pay premium for seven years following the change in order to avoid modified endowment contract mec status what is the effect of a mec modified endowment contract if your policy is a mec modified endowment contract the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment however you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the lifetime of the insured any distribution from a policy that is a mec will be taxed on an incomefirst basis distributions for this purpose include a loan including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan or withdrawal any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent there is gain in the policy at the time of distribution that is the distribution will be includible in income up to the amount your account value exceeds your basis in the policy a  penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most preage   distributions from a policy that is a modified endowment contract when will the  penalty apply to a distribution from a mec a  penalty tax will apply to the taxable portion of most distributions from a policy that is a modified endowment contractthe penalty tax will not apply to distributions to taxpayers whose actual age is at least   distributions in the case of a disability as defined in the code or distributions received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic annuity payments for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the taxpayer and his or her beneficiary how is mec status determined a modified endowment contract mec is a life insurance policy that has had cumulative premium payments made during the first seven years that exceed a limit defined in the tax code this limit is called the pay limit and depends in part on the amount of the policys death benefit and the age of the insured at any point in time during the first seven policy years premiums paid cannot exceed the sum of the annual pay limits or the policy will become a mec this means your total limit will increase each of your first seven policy years after seven years mec testing will not apply unless at any point in time a material change requires your policy to start a new  pay testing period with new  pay limits whenever there is a material change under a policy the policy will generally be a treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the policy is a modified endowment contract and b subjected to a new pay period and new pay limit material changes include a face amount increase the addition of a rider or an increase in its amount a reduction in rating a change to nonsmoker status or a substitution of insured and all could result in a loss of grandfathered status there are also changes considered reductions in benefits during a pay test period that trigger a retroactive recalculation and testing of premiums a reduction in benefits during a pay test period causes the policy to be retested as if the policy had been issued at the reduced level of benefits this could cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract based upon premiums paid prior to the reduction in benefits what is the basis in a life insurance policy your basis sometimes also referred to as your investment in the contract generally will equal the premiums you have paid less the amount of any previous distributions from your policy that were not taxable for modified endowment contracts your basis is also increased by the amount of any prior loan under your policy that was considered taxable income to you what are taxable events if your policy is not a mec modified endowment contract upon full surrender any amount by which the proceeds we pay including amounts we use to repay any policy loan and unpaid loan interest exceed your basis in the policy will be includible in income if a policy terminates after a grace period the repayment of any thenoutstanding policy loan and unpaid loan interest will be treated as a distribution and could be subject to tax to the extent the distribution exceeds your basis in the policy if you make a partial withdrawal during the first  years of your policy all or part of the withdrawal may be taxable if there is gain in your policy even if the withdrawal does not exceed the cost basis if you make an assignment of rights or benefits under your policy and the policy is a mec or subject to a policy loan you may be deemed to have received a distribution from your policy all or part of which may be taxable if you reduce your benefits under a policy it is possible that amounts previously paid as premiums will exceed the amount the tax law permits for your policy to be treated as life insurance this could cause amounts to be forced out of the contract to keep its qualification as life insurance these forceouts could be required at the time of the reduction andor in future years all or a portion of any amounts forced out may be taxable to the extent there is gain in your policy all amounts includible in income under a life insurance policy will be considered ordinary income as opposed to capital gain if your policy is a mec any distribution from your policy will be taxed on an income first basis distributions for this purpose include a loan including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan or withdrawal a  penalty tax also will apply to

page how is the value of the investment options determined amounts that you allocate under your variable life policy to any of the investment options are invested in a corresponding portfolio that is part of eq advisors trust the value of your variable investment option is measured in units each unit has a unit value while the unit value relates to the net asset value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio there is not a onetoone correlation in the dollar amount for example if at the time of the portfolios inception the net asset value of the portfolio was  per share the unit value of the corresponding investment option may actually have been  per unit if the portfolios net asset value grew to  per share the next day the unit value of the corresponding variable investment option would have increased proportionately but not by the exact same dollar amount the value of each unit will increase or decrease each day and reflect all reinvested dividends and distributions from the corresponding portfolio the daily unit value calculation will also take into account the deduction of any mortality and expense risk charges that apply under your contractpolicy the number of your units in any variable investment option does not change unless there is an event or transaction under your contractpolicy that involves moving assets into or out of that option whenever any amount is withdrawn or deducted from one of your contractpolicys variable investment options we redeem the number of units that has a value equal to that amount on the effective date of the redemption this happens for example when all or a portion of monthly deductions and transactionbased charges are allocated to that option or when loans transfers withdrawals and surrenders are made from that option your investment results in a variable investment option will depend on those of the related portfolio any gains will generally be tax deferred and the life insurance benefits we pay upon the death of the insured will generally be federal income tax free daily unit values are available online for most variable life and annuity contracts through the axa web site login or register  what is

performance information how can i obtain performance information the axa web site displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within most of our variable life and annuity contracts select the view link under performance information on the portfolio summary page performance information is a twopage report showing the monthend and the quarterend annualized rates of return of the eq advisors trust portfolios to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the numbers that are presented it is essential that you read both of the reports and the footnotes on each use the page down key or the scroll bar to view the second reportsome information to keep in mind as you review these reports annualized rates of return are based on the percentage change in net asset value with dividends and capital gains reinvested investment performance of the equitable advisors trust the trust is a mutual fund which holds portfolios that correspond to the investment options available under your variable life policy is calculated after deduction of investment management fees and direct operating expense of the trust this performance calculation is not representative of the actual return you would receive under your variable life insurance policy changes in policy values depend not only on the investment performance of the trust but also on the insurance and administrative charges sales charges and the mortality and expense risk charges applicable under a policy these policy charges effectively reduce the dollar amount of any net gains and increase the dollar amount of any net losses the investment options available under your variable life contract are not publicly traded mutual funds as such they do not have security or ticker symbols like publicly traded mutual funds and cannot be accessed via public mutual fund lookup sites please note that while some of these investment options may have similar names investment managers and investment objectives as publicly traded mutual funds they are completely separate portfolios that are collectively administered through the equitable advisors trust in general you should be aware of the differences when comparing performance of mutual funds and their variable annuity or variable life counterpart portfoliosmajor factors that can contribute to these differences include the portfolios underlying fee structure management and administrative expenses insurance and contract related charges in addition to management expenses not applicable to mutual funds the timing of the portfolios purchase and sale of securities differences in cash flows new sales and redemptions other strategies employed by the fund manager for tax purposes not applicable to variable portfolios given their taxdeferred status why does the rate of return differ between different variable products for the same investment option annualized rates of return may differ because the fees and expenses associated with the particular investment option are different under the two products check your policycontract prospectus for detail on the fees and expenses of the investment portfolios note that annualized rates of return are not representative of the actual return you would receive under your policy changes in policy values depend not only on the investment performance of the various options but also on applicable insurance and administrative charges applicable sales charges and the mortality and expense risk charges that are deducted premiums or contributions made to your policy as well as any loans or withdrawals will also affect its values investment transactions can i automatically rebalance the amounts in the investment options asset rebalancing is a feature that has been added

portion of the death benefit from your policy if the insured person is medically diagnosed with a condition limiting life expectancy to six months or less twelve months or less in vermont and oklahoma how do i include living benefits in my policy when introduced living benefits was made automatically available  free of charge  to almost all axa policies with face amounts of  or more that were issued prior to march   or the date of state insurance department approval if later on an as needed basis today generally speaking if you apply for an axa life insurance policy with a face amount of at least  and which is subject to underwriting the living benefits rider is automatically included  unless you specifically asked to have it excluded there is no charge if the rider is included at issue if however you initially excluded the living benefits rider and wish to add it after the policy has been issued you will be charged an administrative fee of  in addition we may require that the insured undergo blood testing and provide evidence of insurability to add the rider at a later date how much money can i get as living benefits generally you can receive any amount between  and  of the proceeds  in vermont oklahoma and illinois that would be payable at death up to a maximum of  if you own more than one policy the combined maximum you may request for all policies issued by each axa subsidiary is  if i receive a living benefits payment does it affect how much is left to my beneficiaries yes a living benefits payment acts as a lien against your policy it reduces the death benefit payable to your beneficiaries it also reduces the amount of money available for loans as well as the cash value of your policy the lien equals the amount of the living benefits payment you receive plus accrued interest is a living benefits payment taxable to me it may be you should consult with your personal tax advisor on this issue what happens to my policy if i receive a payment and the insured person lives longer than expected nothing unless the amount of the lien including interest plus policy premiums advanced by axa if any reaches a point where it equals the total death benefit payable under the policy in this case you may repay the lien or let the policy terminate premium payments how can i confirm my premium payment amount online through the axa web site login or

funds and do not appear in the mutual fund listings that are published in many daily newspapers barrons a financial weekly newspaper does include a listing for variable annuities and life accounts in its market week section the unit price fourweek percent total return and a  week percent total return is reported as of a specified date for the investment portfolios available for selected axa variable life policies can i download values into quicken programs like quicken and microsoft money use ticker symbols of publiclytraded stocks and retail mutual funds to gather their data neither your axa policies nor the funds that back them are retail mutual funds and therefore do not have ticker symbols the investment portfolios that you have access to within your policy or contract do not have ticker symbols so you wont be able to look them up on mutual fund sites to determine their most current price the axa web site your online information source for the status and current values of your axa life and annuity contracts does provide you with the most recent closing price for all the investment portfolios you have available to you in addition eqaccess also displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within our variable life and annuity contracts login or register please remember that while several of your variable investment options do indeed have substantially similar investment strategies and policies of publicly traded mutual funds they are subject to different management fees and expenses furthermore the actual performance under your individual policy or contract reflects insurancerelated charges which would not apply in a typical mutual fund in general you should be aware of the differences when comparing performance of mutual funds and their variable annuity or variable life counterpart portfolios major factors that can contribute to these differences include the portfolios underlying fee structure management and administrative expenses insurance and contract related charges in addition to management expenses not applicable to mutual funds the timing of the portfolios purchase and sale of securities differences in cash flows new sales and redemptions and other strategies employed by the fund manager for tax purposes not applicable to variable portfolios given their taxdeferred status why is unit value shown as na in the axa web site due to a technical problem the axa web site is currently unable to retrieve the value of units in that fund this is only a temporary problem and you should try again later why do the unit values for the same investment option differ unit values for the same investment option under different variable products may differ because the types or level of charges deducted before the unit value is calculated may differ by product check your policycontract prospectus for detail on charges for the particular product the policiescontracts were introduced in different years and a new set of unit prices was established note that although the two products may have different unit values for the same investment option the annualized rates of return for the products may in fact be the same you can access performancerate of return information from the portfolio summary screen of the axa web site find a financial professional have a
