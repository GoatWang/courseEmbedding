frederick m baron and brent m rosenthal dallas for petitioners elizabeth m thompson houston for celotex corp gary d elliston and kevin j cook of dehay  blanchard dallas for nat gypsum co us gypsum corp keene corp and gaf corp gonzalez justice this asbestos products liability case is one of first impression in texas petitioners concede that they are unable to identify the specific manufacturer of a product and therefore seek to impose collective liability against a number of possible tortfeasors suit was brought by the survivors of ethel gaulding deceased against celotex corporation national gypsum company united states gypsum company keene corporation and gaf corporation five alleged manufacturers of asbestoscontaining board the petitioners claim that the board was defective and unreasonably dangerous and was marketed without an adequate warning alerting users of the hazards of asbestos exposure they further claim the board was negligently designed and labeled the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and the court of appeals affirmed  swd  we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals petitioners john gaulding carolyn wylie and barbara pryor are the surviving adult children of ethel gaulding they allege that their mother died from mesothelioma which is cancer of the lining of the lungs caused by exposure to asbestos mrs gauldings exposure to asbestos occurred in june of  and thereafter when her husband built a vanity cabinet out of asbestoscontaining board the board had been purchased at a salvage yard which is no longer in existence mrs gaulding died in march of  over twentyeight years after her initial exposure to the board in their sole point of error the petitioners contend that the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial courts summary judgment because under the doctrines of joint and several liability and res ipsa loquitur and the various theories of collective liability alternative liability concert of action enterprise liability and market share liability genuine issues of material fact exist in this case a fundamental principle of traditional products liability law is that the plaintiff must prove that the defendants supplied the product which caused the injury see armstrong rubber co v urquidez  swd   tex borel v fibreboard paper products corp  fd   th cir flatt v johnsmanville sales corp  fsupp   edtex gray v united states  fsupp   sdtex j sales product liability law in texas  n   in borel it was uncontroverted that the plaintiff was injured from inhaling asbestos dust and that he was in fact exposed to the products of all of the defendants borel  fd at  in the case before us however it is undisputed that mrs gauldings survivors have not established who manufactured the asbestos board used in the gaulding home instead they named the five respondent companies as defendants which they claim dominated the market of asbestoscontaining wallboard at the time of mrs gauldings exposure the petitioners further admit that they have not joined all possible tortfeasors as defendants petitioners contend that since texas courts have adopted joint and several liability and res ipsa loquitur the collective liability theories they advance should also be adopted concerning joint and several liability the petitioners rely on landers v east texas salt water disposal co  tex   swd   in landers the plaintiff was the owner of a small lake which had been drained cleaned and stocked with fish two defendants an oil company and a pipeline company allegedly permitted salt water and oil to escape from the pipeline into the lake killing the fish the plaintiff sought to enjoin further pollution of his lake and to recover damages from these two defendants based on the defendants pleas of misjoinder the trial court ordered a severance so that each defendant could be tried separately when the plaintiff refused to replead separate claims against each defendant the trial court dismissed the suit and the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court this court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court concluding that the plaintiff had properly pled a claim for joint and several liability against alleged tortfeasors whose separate acts produced the indivisible injury unlike in the instant case there it was unequivocally alleged that each of the two defendants contributed to the overall injury see thompson v johnsmanville sales corp  fd   th cir the petitioners reliance on res ipsa loquitur is also misplaced this doctrine is applicable only when the following two factors are present  the character of the injury is such that it would not have occurred in the absence of negligence and  the instrumentality which caused the injury is shown to have been under the sole management and control of the defendant porterfield v brinegar  swd   tex mobil chem co v bell  swd   tex inherent in the latter factor is the requirement that the defendant be proved to have some causal connection with the plaintiffs injury in a situation such as the one before us when the petitioners admit they cannot identify the responsible tortfeasor res ipsa has no applicability the petitioners further assert that collective liability is supported by the texas legislatures exemption of toxic torts from recent reform of joint and several liability see texcivprac  remcode ann § c vernon supp however this provision specifically states this section does not create a cause of action id § d emphasis added we will now discuss the collective liability theories advanced by petitioners alternative liability alternative liability initially adopted by the california supreme court in summers v tice  cald   pd   relaxes the plaintiffs burden of identifying the actual tortfeasor and thus may allow the plaintiff to prevail when the traditional rules of causation would prevent recovery under this theory of liability which is embodied in the restatement of the law of torts second when independent acts of negligence are simultaneously committed by two or more tortfeasors and only one act results in injury the plaintiff is relieved of his burden of proof restatement second of torts § b  the burden shifts to the defendants to exculpate themselves a crucial element to alternative liability is that all possible wrongdoers must be brought before the court abel v eli lilly  co  mich   nwd   cert denied  us   sct   ledd   starling v seaboard coast line rr  fsupp   sdga when a plaintiff fails to join all possible defendants alternative liability does not apply goldman v johnsmanville sales corp  ohio std   ned    vigiolto v johnsmanville corp  fsupp   wdpa  affd  fd  d cir because the petitioners in the instant case concede they have not joined all possible tortfeasors as defendants alternative liability is not applicable concert of action under concert of action those who are in pursuit of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act and actively participate in it or lend aid cooperation or encouragement to the wrongdoer are equally liable prosser and keeton on the law of torts §  w keeton th ed  this theory developed in cases in which innocent bystanders were injured during illegal drag races see eg bierczynski v rogers  ad  del hood v evans  gaapp   sed   concert of action is also embodied in the restatement of the law of torts a common plan design or express agreement alone will not result in concert of action liability the defendants must participate in acts of a tortious character in carrying out the plan or agreement restatement second of torts §  comment b  j sales at  most jurisdictions that have considered this theory have rejected its application to latent disease product liability cases which involve numerous manufacturers in sindell v abbott laboratories  cald   calrptr   pd  cert denied  us   sct   ledd   the california supreme court rejected concert of action in a diethylstilbesterol des case and concluded that this theory requires more than mere communication and cooperation among the members of a particular industry it was held that when manufacturers customarily rely on the experience of others producing the same product such conduct will not be construed as even a tacit understanding to engage in tortious activity id  cal rptr at   pd at  but see bichler v eli lilly  co  add   nysd   affd  nyd   nysd   ned   modified version of concert of action in a des case was allowed to be submitted to a jury when the manufacturers took part in conscious parallel conduct cf collins v eli lilly  co  wisd   nwd  cert denied  us   sct   ledd   allegations did not support theory that defendants tacitly agreed to produce and market des without warning of dangers the petitioners rely on a recent delaware supreme court case nicolet inc v nutt  ad  del in nicolet it was held that a cause of action exists against a party whose asbestos products did not cause the purported injury but who allegedly conspired with other asbestos manufacturers to intentionally misrepresent and suppress relevant information regarding the health hazards of asbestos there has been no such allegation nor summary judgment proof in the present action enterprise liability under enterprise liability each manufacturer is held accountable because of adherence to an industrywide standard this theory was originally formulated in hall v ei dupont de nemours  co  fsupp  edny in hall the plaintiffs were unable to identify the specific manufacturer of blasting caps which exploded and injured a number of children the plaintiffs brought suit against all six american blasting cap manufacturers and their trade association the court held that enterprise liability will apply when it is shown that the defendants were jointly aware of the risks at issue and possessed a joint capacity to reduce or affect those risks id at  in order to prevail the plaintiff need not identify which of the defendantmanufacturers made the injurycausing product so long as it is demonstrated that it is more probable than not that an injury was caused by a product manufactured by one of the named defendants id at  enterprise liability as embodied in hall has been rejected by virtually all other jurisdictions that have considered this concept mulcahy v eli lilly  co  nwd   iowa  martin v abbott laboratories  wnd   pd    zafft v eli lilly  co  swd   mo sindell  calrptr at   pd at  cummins v firestone tire  rubber co  pasuper   ad    namm v charles e frosst  co  njsuper   ad    the prominent reason for declining recovery under this theory is its limited application to cases which involve only a small number of manufacturers in a highly centralized industry the hall court recognized this limitation and stated what would be fair and feasible with regard to an industry of five or ten producers might be manifestly unreasonable if applied to a decentralized industry composed of thousands of small producers hall  fsupp at  another reason some courts have rejected enterprise liability is the inability to prove the defendants collectively controlled their conduct by jointly imposed safety standards mulcahy  nwd at  sindell  calrptr at   pd at  cummins  ad at  the petitioners in the instant case have failed to establish the criteria for imposing enterprise liability there is no proof that it is more probable than not that mrs gauldings injury was caused by board manufactured by one of the five defendants furthermore there is no allegation nor evidence that the risks inherent in asbestos board products were jointly controlled by the defendants thus we decline to apply this theory to the case before us market share liability the final theory urged by petitioners is market share liability in a des case the california supreme court first applied this theory by fashioning an apportionment of liability based on the relative market share of the defendant manufacturers sindell  calrptr   pd  the sindell approach requires that a plaintiff join manufacturers of a substantial share of the des produced or marketed in the relevant geographical area and prove a prima facie case on every element except identification of the direct tortfeasor at that point the burden shifts to the defendants to prove that they did not cause the plaintiffs injury if a defendant is unable to do so then it is held liable for a market share percentage of the plaintiffs damages recently the california court further explained its application of market share liability in brown v superior court  cald   calrptr   pd   other courts have also applied variations of market share liability see hymowitz v eli lilly  co  nyd   nysd   ned   westlaw collins v eli lilly co  wisd   nwd  cert denied  us   sct   ledd   george v parkedavis  wnd   pd   martin v abbott laboratories  wnd   pd   shackil v lederle laboratories  njsuper   ad  appeal granted  ad  nj based on the particular facts of this case we will not apply market share liability or any variation of it it is undisputed that the asbestos board to which gaulding was exposed was purchased at a salvage yard there is no way to know whether this product was initially sold in texas or whether it was placed into the stream of commerce someplace far away conceivably the board could have been manufactured in some distant state during a time period years earlier than the time that gauldings husband purchased it ultimately the board was discarded by someone and made its way to the salvage yard however the practical impossibility of determining where or when the product was marketed makes insurmountable the problem of identifying the defendants relevant market shares we conclude that no variation of market share liability could be applied rationally and fairly on the facts of this case we express no opinion on the question of fungibility in this case conclusion we are not to be construed as approving or disapproving alternative liability concert of action enterprise liability or market share liability in an appropriate case we do however hold that these theories do not apply to the facts of this case consequently as the respondent companies have shown the inapplicability of the collective liability theories to the facts of this case summary judgment in their favor was proper for the above reasons the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed footnotes  in summers the plaintiff was struck in the eye when two hunters negligently fired their shotguns because the defendants fired simultaneously the plaintiff was unable to identify which defendant was actually responsible for the injury the california supreme court shifted the burden of proof to the defendants to offer evidence to determine which one caused the injury summers  pd at  comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is under no obligation to do so or

which they claim dominated the market of asbestoscontaining wallboard at the time of mrs gauldings exposure the petitioners further admit that they have not joined all possible tortfeasors as defendants petitioners contend that since texas courts have adopted joint and several liability and res ipsa loquitur the collective liability theories they advance should also be adopted concerning joint and several liability the petitioners rely on landers v east texas salt water disposal co  tex   swd   in landers the plaintiff was the owner of a small lake which had been drained cleaned and stocked with fish two defendants an oil company and a pipeline company allegedly permitted salt water and oil to escape from the pipeline into the lake killing the fish the plaintiff sought to enjoin further pollution of his lake and to recover damages from these two defendants based on the defendants pleas of misjoinder the trial court ordered a severance so that each defendant could be tried separately when the plaintiff refused to replead separate claims against each defendant the trial court dismissed the suit and the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court this court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court concluding that the plaintiff had properly pled a claim for joint and several liability against alleged tortfeasors whose separate acts produced the indivisible injury unlike in the instant case there it was unequivocally alleged that each of the two defendants contributed to the overall injury see thompson v johnsmanville sales corp  fd   th cir the petitioners reliance on res ipsa loquitur is also misplaced this doctrine is applicable only when the following two factors are present  the character of the injury is such that it would not have occurred in the absence of negligence and  the instrumentality which caused the injury is shown to have been under the sole management and control of the defendant porterfield v brinegar  swd   tex mobil chem co v bell  swd   tex inherent in the latter factor is the requirement that the defendant be proved to have some causal connection with the plaintiffs injury in a situation such as the one before us when the petitioners admit they cannot identify the responsible tortfeasor res ipsa has no applicability the petitioners further assert that collective liability is supported by the texas legislatures exemption of toxic torts from recent reform of joint and several liability see texcivprac  remcode ann § c vernon supp however this provision specifically states this section does not create a cause of action id § d emphasis added we will now discuss the collective liability theories advanced by petitioners alternative liability alternative liability initially adopted by the california supreme court in summers v tice  cal d   pd    relaxes the plaintiffs burden of identifying the actual tortfeasor and thus may allow the plaintiff to prevail when the traditional rules of causation would prevent recovery under this theory of liability which is embodied in the restatement of the law of torts second when independent acts of negligence are simultaneously committed by two or more tortfeasors and only one act results in injury the plaintiff is relieved of his burden of proof restatement second of torts § b  the burden shifts to the defendants to exculpate themselves a crucial element to alternative liability is that all possible wrongdoers must be brought before the court abel v eli lilly  co  mich   nwd   cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   starling v seaboard coast line rr  f supp   sdga when a plaintiff fails to join all possible defendants alternative liability does not apply goldman v johnsmanville sales corp  ohio st d   ned    vigiolto v johnsmanville corp  f supp   wdpa  affd  fd  d cir because the petitioners in the instant case concede they have not joined all possible tortfeasors as defendants alternative liability is not applicable concert of action under concert of action those who are in pursuit of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act and actively participate in it or lend aid cooperation or encouragement to the wrongdoer are equally liable prosser and keeton on the law of torts §  w keeton th ed  this theory developed in cases in which innocent bystanders were injured during illegal drag races see eg bierczynski v rogers  ad  del hood v evans  gaapp   sed   concert of action is also embodied in the restatement of the law of torts a common plan design or express agreement alone will not result in concert of action liability the defendants must participate in acts of a tortious character in carrying out the plan or agreement restatement second of torts §  comment b  j sales at  most jurisdictions that have considered this theory have rejected its application to latent disease product liability cases which involve numerous manufacturers in sindell v abbott laboratories  cal d   cal rptr   pd  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   the california supreme court rejected concert of action in a diethylstilbesterol des case and concluded that this theory requires more than mere communication and cooperation among the members of a particular industry it was held that when manufacturers customarily rely on the experience of others producing the same product such conduct will not be construed as even a tacit understanding to engage in tortious activity id  cal rptr at   pd at  but see bichler v eli lilly  co  add   nysd   affd  nyd   nysd   ned   modified version of concert of action in a des case was allowed to be submitted to a jury when the manufacturers took part in conscious parallel conduct cf collins v eli lilly  co  wis d   nwd  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   allegations did not support theory that defendants tacitly agreed to produce and market des without warning of dangers the petitioners rely on a recent delaware supreme court case nicolet inc v nutt  ad  del in nicolet it was held that a cause of action exists against a party whose asbestos products did not cause the purported injury but who allegedly conspired with other asbestos manufacturers to intentionally misrepresent and suppress relevant information regarding the health hazards of asbestos there has been no such allegation nor summary judgment proof in the present action  enterprise liability under enterprise liability each manufacturer is held accountable because of adherence to an industrywide standard this theory was originally formulated in hall v ei dupont de nemours  co  f supp  edny in hall the plaintiffs were unable to identify the specific manufacturer of blasting caps which exploded and injured a number of children the plaintiffs brought suit against all six american blasting cap manufacturers and their trade association the court held that enterprise liability will apply when it is shown that the defendants were jointly aware of the risks at issue and possessed a joint capacity to reduce or affect those risks id at  in order to prevail the plaintiff need not identify which of the defendantmanufacturers made the injurycausing product so long as it is demonstrated that it is more probable than not that an injury was caused by a product manufactured by one of the named defendants id at  enterprise liability as embodied in hall has been rejected by virtually all other jurisdictions that have considered this concept mulcahy v eli lilly  co  nwd   iowa  martin v abbott laboratories  washd   pd    zafft v eli lilly  co  swd   mo sindell  calrptr at   pd at  cummins v firestone tire  rubber co  pasuper   ad    namm v charles e frosst  co  njsuper   ad    the prominent reason for declining recovery under this theory is its limited application to cases which involve only a small number of manufacturers in a highly centralized industry the hall court recognized this limitation and stated what would be fair and feasible with regard to an industry of five or ten producers might be manifestly unreasonable if applied to a decentralized industry composed of thousands of small producers hall  fsupp at  another reason some courts have rejected enterprise liability is the inability to prove the defendants collectively controlled their conduct by jointly imposed safety standards mulcahy  nwd at  sindell  calrptr at   pd at  cummins  ad at  the petitioners in the instant case have failed to establish the criteria for imposing enterprise liability there is no proof that it is more probable than not that mrs gauldings injury was caused by board manufactured by one of the five defendants furthermore there is no allegation nor evidence that the risks inherent in asbestos board products were jointly controlled by the defendants thus we decline to apply this theory to the case before us market share liability the final theory urged by petitioners is market share liability in a des case the california supreme court first applied this theory by fashioning an apportionment of liability based on the relative market share of the defendant manufacturers sindell  cal rptr   pd  the sindell approach requires that a plaintiff join manufacturers of a substantial share of the des produced or marketed in the relevant geographical area and prove a prima facie case on every element except identification of the direct tortfeasor at that point the burden shifts to the defendants to prove that they did not cause the plaintiffs injury if a defendant is unable to do so then it is held liable for a market share percentage of the plaintiffs damages recently the california court further explained its application of market share liability in brown v superior court  cal d   cal rptr   pd   other courts have also applied variations of market share liability see hymowitz v eli lilly  co  nyd   nysd   ned   westlaw collins v eli lilly co  wis d   nwd  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   george v parkedavis  washd   pd   martin v abbott laboratories  washd   pd   shackil v lederle laboratories  njsuper   ad  appeal granted  ad  nj based on the particular facts of this case we will not apply market share liability  or any variation of it it is undisputed that the asbestos board to which gaulding was exposed was purchased at a salvage yard there is no way to know whether this product was initially sold in texas or whether it was placed into the stream of commerce someplace far away conceivably the board could have been manufactured in some distant state during a time period years earlier than the time that gauldings husband purchased it ultimately the board was discarded by someone and made its way to the salvage yard however the practical impossibility of determining where or when the product was marketed makes insurmountable the problem of identifying the defendants relevant market shares we conclude that no variation of market share liability could be applied rationally and fairly on the facts of this case we express no opinion on the question of fungibility in this case conclusion we are not to be construed as approving or disapproving alternative liability concert of action enterprise liability or market share liability in an appropriate case we do however hold that these theories do not apply to the facts of this case consequently as the respondent companies have shown the inapplicability of the collective liability theories to the facts of this case summary judgment in their favor was proper for the above reasons the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed notes  in summers the plaintiff was struck in the eye when two hunters negligently fired their shotguns because the defendants fired simultaneously the plaintiff was unable to identify which defendant was actually responsible for the injury the california supreme court shifted the burden of proof to the defendants to offer evidence to determine which one caused the injury summers  pd at  john
