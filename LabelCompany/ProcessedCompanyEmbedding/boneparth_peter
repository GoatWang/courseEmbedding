expect to see from jones in the first halfpeter boneparth the first half of  is going to be marked by a good deal of uncertainty theres the consolidation of department stores and lots of closings on the horizon i feel that we really have a great relationship with federated and may so im confident that we will do well also we feel very good over the long term about the strength of our brandswwd how do you expect to deal with the federatedmay mergerpb the increasing competitiveness at retail especially with this merger will only make us faster and more fashionright we are working on offering more exclusive product and coming out of  i see us having a tremendous growth opportunity with federated they are looking to do business with those companies that have the kind of backend support that
