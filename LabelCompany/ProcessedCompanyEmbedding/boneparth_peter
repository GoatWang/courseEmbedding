jones in the first halfpeter boneparth the first half of  is going to be marked by a good deal of uncertainty theres the consolidation of department stores and lots of closings on the horizon i feel that we really have a great relationship with federated and may so im confident that we will do well also we feel very good over the long term about the strength of our brandswwd how do you expect to deal with the federatedmay mergerpb the increasing competitiveness at retail especially with this merger will only make us faster and more fashionright we are working on offering more exclusive product and coming out of  i see us having a tremendous growth opportunity with federated they are looking to do business with those companies that have the kind of backend support that jones has they are getting rid of the unproductive real estate and trying to sell more goods at regular price i think we are much aligned with them in that regardwwd how is the growth of barneys new york goingpb we

barneys are looking for luxury and i believe that customer isnt as affected by the economy the way other shoppers are they are not focused on price and have high levels of disposable income as well as net worth our biggest challenge here is how do we stay cool while becoming more commercial with that said we are not looking to make barneys the size of neimans or saks but we do want to grow the
