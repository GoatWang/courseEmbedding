in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons he assembled and led the initial team of writers consisting of john swartzwelder jon vitti george meyer jeff martin al jean mike reiss jay kogen and wallace wolodarsky simon has been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles such as bleeding gums murphy one of his contributions to the shows character development was his proposal that waylon smithers should be gay but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the shows history ryan j budke of tv squad described the segment as one of the most refined simpsons pop references ever and knows people that consider this the point that they realized the simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent simon cowrote the episode two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish with swartzwelder an episode which tom shales of the washington post has described as a bullseye political satire the final episode he cowrote for season two was the way we was alongside jean and reiss while reiss and jean took over as showrunners simon remained on the writing staff for seasons three – and four – for the third season he cowrote treehouse of horror ii and conceived the story for the sideshow bob episode black widower together with mystery author thomas chastain hoping to construct a full mystery story vitti wrote the episodes teleplay

writing credit was for the dial z for zombies segment of treehouse of horror iii although they initially worked well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received particularly the praise for the shows writing simon felt that groenings involvement was limited and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show simon later spoke well of groenings influence particularly on the shows positive tone as well as groening simon was often at odds with brooks and production company gracie films while working on the simpsons he and brooks had cocreated the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs relationship simon left gracie films and the simpsons in  simon commented that he wasnt enjoying it anymore wished to pursue other projects and that any show ive ever worked on it turns me into a monster i go crazy i hate myself before leaving he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the shows profits every year particularly from home media and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since  the deal means he made over  million a year from the simpsons he later told stanford magazine that tens of millions was a closer figure simon commented when i was there i thought i was underpaid i thought i wasnt getting enough credit for it now i think

commented when i was doing the simpsons people couldnt see how smart it was because of the low moments theres something about this show people who like it say its classy they dont see how vulgar it is carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with simon on his own website carlin wrote of the show always check mental health of creative partner beforehand loved the actors loved the crew had a great time couldnt wait to get the fuck out of there in his final book the posthumously published last words  carlin elaborated i had a great time i never laughed so much so often so hard as i did with cast

simpsons simon codeveloped the animated series the simpsons which premiered on the fox network in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons he assembled and led the initial team of writers consisting of john swartzwelder jon vitti george meyer jeff martin al jean mike reiss jay kogen and wallace wolodarsky simon has been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles such as bleeding gums murphy one of his contributions to the shows character development was his proposal that waylon smithers should be gay but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the shows history ryan j budke of tv squad described the segment as one of the most refined simpsons pop references ever and knows people that consider this the point that they realized the simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent simon cowrote the episode two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish with swartzwelder an episode which tom shales of the washington post has described as a bullseye political satire the final episode he cowrote for season two was the way we was alongside jean and reiss while reiss and jean took over as showrunners simon remained on the

well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received particularly the praise for the shows writing simon felt that groenings involvement was limited and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show simon later spoke well of groenings influence particularly on the shows positive tone as well as groening simon was often at odds with brooks and production company gracie films while working on the simpsons he and brooks had cocreated the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs relationship simon left gracie films and the simpsons in  simon commented that he wasnt enjoying it anymore wished to pursue other projects and that any show ive ever worked on it turns me into a monster i go crazy i hate myself before leaving he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the shows profits every year particularly from home media and an executive producer credit despite

low moments theres something about this show people who like it say its classy they dont see how vulgar it is carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with simon on his own website carlin wrote of the show always check mental health of creative partner beforehand loved the actors loved the crew had a great time couldnt wait to get the fuck out of there in his final book the posthumously published last words  carlin elaborated i had a great time i never laughed so much so often so hard as i did with cast members alex rocco chris rich tony starke there was a very strange very good

work on the simpsons simon codeveloped the animated series the simpsons which premiered on the fox network in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons he assembled and led the initial team of writers consisting of john swartzwelder jon vitti george meyer jeff martin al jean mike reiss jay kogen and wallace wolodarsky simon has been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles such as bleeding gums murphy one of his contributions to the shows character development was his proposal that waylon smithers should be gay but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the

well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received

the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs

work on the simpsons simon codeveloped the animated series the simpsons which premiered on the fox network in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons he assembled and led the initial team of writers consisting of john swartzwelder jon vitti george meyer jeff martin al jean mike reiss jay kogen and wallace wolodarsky simon has been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles such as bleeding gums murphy one of his contributions to the shows character development was his proposal that waylon smithers should be gay but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the shows history ryan j budke of tv squad described the segment as one of the most refined simpsons pop references ever and knows people that consider this the point that they realized the simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent simon cowrote the episode two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish with swartzwelder an episode which tom shales of the washington post has described as a bullseye political satire the final episode he cowrote for season two was the way we was alongside jean and reiss while reiss and jean took over as showrunners simon remained on the

well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received particularly the praise for the shows writing simon felt that groenings involvement was limited and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show simon later spoke well of groenings influence particularly on the shows positive tone as well as groening simon was often at odds with brooks and production company gracie films while working on the simpsons he and brooks had cocreated the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs relationship simon left gracie films and the simpsons in  simon commented that he wasnt enjoying it anymore wished to pursue other projects and that any show ive ever worked on it turns me into a monster i go crazy i hate myself before leaving he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the shows profits every year particularly from home media and an executive producer credit despite

work on the simpsons simon codeveloped the animated series the simpsons which premiered on the fox network in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons he assembled and led the initial team of writers consisting of john swartzwelder jon vitti george meyer jeff martin al jean mike reiss jay kogen and wallace wolodarsky simon has been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles such as bleeding gums murphy one of his contributions to the shows character development was his proposal that waylon smithers should be gay but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the shows history ryan j budke of tv squad described the segment as one of the most refined simpsons pop references ever and knows people that consider this the point that they realized the simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent simon cowrote the episode two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish with swartzwelder an episode which tom shales of the washington post has described as a bullseye political satire the final episode he cowrote for season two was the way we was alongside jean and reiss while reiss and jean took over as showrunners simon remained on the writing staff for seasons three – and four – for the third season he cowrote treehouse of horror ii and conceived the story for the sideshow bob episode black widower together with mystery author

proposed the land of chocolate sequence from burns verkaufen der kraftwerk simons final writing credit was for the dial z for zombies segment of treehouse of horror iii although they initially worked well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received particularly the praise for the shows writing simon felt that groenings involvement was limited and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show simon later spoke well of groenings influence particularly on the shows positive tone as well as groening simon was often at odds with brooks and production company gracie films while working on the simpsons he and brooks had cocreated the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs relationship simon left gracie films and the simpsons in  simon commented that he wasnt enjoying it anymore wished to pursue other projects and that any show ive ever worked on it turns me into a monster i go crazy i hate myself before leaving he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the shows profits every year particularly from home media and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since  the deal means he made over  million a year from the simpsons he later told stanford magazine that tens of millions was a closer figure simon commented when i was there i thought i was underpaid i thought i wasnt getting enough credit for it now i think its completely the opposite i get too much credit for it and the money is ridiculous subsequent media

low moments theres something about this show people who like it say its classy they dont see how vulgar it is carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with simon on his own website carlin wrote of the show always check mental health of creative partner beforehand loved the actors loved the crew had a great time couldnt wait to get the fuck out of there in his final book the posthumously published last words  carlin elaborated i had a great time i never laughed so much so often so hard as i did with cast members alex rocco chris rich tony starke there was a very strange very good

work on the simpsons simon codeveloped the animated series the simpsons which premiered on the fox network in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons he assembled and led the initial team of writers consisting of john swartzwelder jon vitti george meyer jeff martin al jean mike reiss jay kogen and wallace wolodarsky simon has been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles

it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the shows history ryan j budke of tv squad described the segment as one of the most refined simpsons pop references ever and knows people that consider this the point that they realized the simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent simon cowrote the episode two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish with swartzwelder an episode which tom shales of the washington post has described as a bullseye political satire the final episode he cowrote for season two was the way we was alongside jean and reiss while reiss and jean took over as showrunners simon remained on the

well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received particularly the praise for the shows writing simon felt that groenings involvement was limited and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show simon later spoke well of groenings influence particularly on the shows positive tone as well as groening simon was often at odds with brooks and production company gracie films while working on the simpsons he and brooks had cocreated the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs relationship simon left gracie films and the simpsons in  simon commented that he wasnt enjoying it anymore wished to pursue other projects and that any show ive ever worked on it turns me into a monster i go crazy i hate myself before leaving he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the shows profits every year particularly from home media and an executive producer credit despite

work on the simpsons simon codeveloped the animated series the simpsons which premiered on the fox network in  and has remained on air ever since the show is regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time with time magazine naming it the th centurys best series the premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in  as part of the tracey ullman show on which simon was a writer and executive producer alongside james l brooks with whom simon had worked on taxi the cartoons were developed into a full series two years later for the simpsons simon served alongside matt groening who conceived the show and the five main characters and brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the shows first – and second – seasons and was creative supervisor for

been credited with developing the shows sensibility former simpsons director brad bird has described him as the unsung hero of the show while vitti has stated to leave out sam simon is to tell the managed version of the simpsons history because he was the guy we wrote for writer ken levine called simon the real creative force behind the simpsonsthe tone the storytelling the level of humor – that was all developed on sams watch levine says that simon brought a level of honesty to the characters and made them threedimensional adding that his comedy is all about character not just a string of gags in the simpsons the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles what are they thinking—that is sams contribution the stories come from the characters simon crafted much of the world of springfield and designed the models for many of the shows recurring characters including mr burns dr hibbert chief wiggum and eddie and lou as well as many of the onetime and guest star roles

it smithers sexuality became one of the shows longestrunning gags simon saw the simpsons as a chance to solve what he didnt like about the saturdaymorning cartoon shows he had worked onhe wanted all the actors in a room together not reading their lines separated from each other the simpsons would have been a great radio show if you just listen to the sound track it works the simpsons utilized a process of collaborative script rewriting by the shows whole writing staff this meant the credited writer may not have been responsible for the majority of an episodes content nevertheless simon was credited with cowriting the season one episodes the telltale head the crepes of wrath and the season finale some enchanted evening some enchanted evening was intended to be the shows premiere but was delayed due to poor animation simon adapted edgar allan poes the raven for the third segment of the season two episode treehouse of horror groening was nervous about the raven because it did not have many gags and felt it would be the worst most pretentious thing they had ever done on the show nevertheless the segment has often been praised as one of the best treehouse of horror stories in the shows history ryan j budke of tv squad described the segment as one of the most refined simpsons pop references ever and knows people that consider this the point that they realized the simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent simon cowrote the episode two cars in every garage and three eyes on every fish with swartzwelder an episode which tom shales of the washington post has described as a bullseye political satire the final episode he cowrote for season two was the way we was alongside jean and reiss while reiss and jean took over as showrunners simon remained on the

well together simon and groenings relationship became very contentious according to groening simon never expected the show to be a success often proclaiming to fellow staff members were thirteen and out—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season therefore he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do whatever they wanted to make the simpsons as good a show as possible regardless of network or public opinion because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed he elaborated in  that really i was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone i was just saying lets just go out and make  episodes that are really good and really funny however groening interpreted it as meaning simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not as simons career would survive whereas his own would not in  groening described simon as brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers ive ever worked with although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced according to john ortveds book the simpsons an uncensored unauthorized history when the show became successful simon resented the media attention groening received particularly the praise for the shows writing simon felt that groenings involvement was limited and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show simon later spoke well of groenings influence particularly on the shows positive tone as well as groening simon was often at odds with brooks and production company gracie films while working on the simpsons he and brooks had cocreated the series sibs  and phenom  as part of a multiseries deal for abc simon did not want to work on either series both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled which put a strain on the pairs relationship simon left gracie films and the simpsons in  simon commented that he wasnt enjoying it anymore wished to pursue other projects and that any show ive ever worked on it turns me into a monster i go crazy i hate myself before leaving he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the shows profits every year particularly from home media and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since  the deal means he made over  million a year from the simpsons he later told stanford magazine that tens of millions was a closer figure simon commented when i was
