then the market crashed i couldn’t find anyone to buy it so i decided to flip the house i hired a contractor who never did any work i heard about armando montelongo from one of his tv shows and watched a lot of people flipping properties i watched all of his episodes took a bunch of notes then realized i was ready to flip the house i hired a new contractor and flipped the house and made  fast forward to  i heard about his real estate training program it was going to be  no one believed that this was a good thing everyone told me it was a waste of time but i’d made  just from watching armando’s tv show so i went and was totally blown awaywhat was undeniable was how much i learned in those first three days of the seminar that i decided to go to the bus tour everyone told me that was just their way of upselling me into spending more money but i knew it was the only way i was going to get out of the rat race the bus tour was everything and beyond i ate up all the information i took pages and pages of notes it was an amazing experience when i get back home i knew i had the education i needed to get going i realized i needed to take the wholesaling class to be more prepared to get goingi spent all summer after that hustling my first deal was  my next deal was  i realized that i needed a good realtor so i could see them without delay and get comps etc but after working with a few i realized it would be best if i became a realtor so i could acquire and sell the properties i flip myself so thats what i did armando montelongo literally changed my lifearmando montelongo companyjeree s ratedi went to the free seminar and signed up for the program however due to my work i was never able to get away to the next part wow working so hard with no days off  years went by so fast one day i was feeling pretty regretful about not being able to follow through and attend so i was really happy when they called me within weeks of that and offered me another opportunity to get involved i jumped at the chance i was going to get to that meeting in sacramento no matter what and it was powerful i couldnt imagine going back home to my same life and not being a part of the team and life changing opportunity i went on the bus tour training and other trainings and its been an absolutely fantastic decision there is a lot of information and armando is well versed in a multitude of learning techniques including keeping it fun and therefore easier for the information to become a part of you he listens and values his students putting a lot of effort into making sure we are successful by providing ongoing trainings plus almost daily real time online trainings and all the hands on help you could ask for by his superb team since the bus tour i have taken other trainings also armando has also provided crucial support in other related areas like asset protection it is such a positive and caring organization friends and family know what i am doing and are excited and are involved and supportive in various ways referring properties to me as well as people who need help i know that with this program you can be guaranteed that the outcome is equal to the effort you put into it i believe you cannot ask for more than that i’m very satisfied with the training and i would highly recommend it as the best there is everarmando montelongo companyjeffrey k ratedi first heard about armando montelongo in january of  through an internet ad it caught my attention because i had just gotten my real estate license in new york i had recently left  years of being a facility and construction manager in manhattan i went to the free event in my area and from there to the threeday seminar this even was where i thought armandos people help you decide if you are ready to commit to the next level of investment the presentation was about changing your mindset clearly everyone there wanted to be successful but they help you determine if you are ready to change your habits so that you can be successful they helped us understand if youre sitting on the fence whether youre ready to move on to the next level chris sanders was probably the most dynamic speaker who had the ability to electrify the room he taught us about the rule of  which opened my eyes to how long it would take for the money in my k to double i realized that i needed to do something differenti did the bus tour that april in dallas and master mentor in may the bus tour was kind of a party atmosphere which i think helps people learn how to break down barriers with strangers in the end it was the bus tour which helped me really understand the flip process another valuable aspect of the armando program is the facebook group where we can connect and speak a common language about real estate i went back to san antonio for asset protection and i think that is all the training ive done with them so far ive put some bids out on foreclosures and online auctionsarmando montelongo companyjavier o ratedi did my first flip a few years ago before i had any knowledge or experience in real estate but we managed to make about  from it so i was interested in learning more thinking that if i can do that without knowing very much imagine what i could do with some real training when i saw the infomercial for armando montelongo’s program on tv i decided this would be a good way to goi went to the  day free event with my wife i was ready to get into it and she was a little bit hesitant it was very informative and it was something that i was very interested in my wife started to become more and more interested at that point and we went to the bus tour together in scottsdale arizona the bus tour was very encouraging i didn’t expect all the energy but it made it very exciting to learn it goes from morning until night not just  nonstop energy we made some great friends at the event who we stayed friends with to this day we do a monthly meetup in arizona that we oversee we get anywhere from  people at those meetings now my wife is fully on board in fact she’s the one who signed us up for the training on commercial deals we’ve been working on a couple of deals and this weekend were finalizing our first wholesale dealthe support we received from the mentors has been top notch you just have to reach out and they are there there’s a ton of support they don’t just give you the information and then it’s done you can always call and get help which is huge for us i’m now doing this full time and in a few months my wife will be full time as wellarmando montelongo companyjustin s ratedi heard about armando montelongo’s program on latenight television back in  i have been interested in getting involved in real estate for over  years and thought it was time to get started in it the threeday event was phenomenal the speakers were clear and enthusiastic the material was fairly new to me although i do have a background in construction i had always wanted to flip houses but had never considered the possibility of passive income the bus tour was next and again great information and the ability to see it in person while walking through the houses one of my main takeaways was the systematic approach that armando takes there really isn’t any guesswork involved you keep in mainstream and simple you leave your emotions out of it i keep updated with armando’s webinars and have kept in touch with some of the people i’ve met along the way since the bus tour one of my big push was finding an investor i was able to see that the people i know who have of money understand that it takes money to invest and that they are likely to be interested in working together i’ve worked with a lot of millionaires and i worked up the courage to ask them to invest with me now i’ve done  wholesale deals  flips and now i have  rentals it kind of amazes me i literally spent everything i had to go through this training because i knew it was exactly what i wanted to do if you simply take action and follow the system you’ll be successfularmando montelongo companyjulie e ratedi heard about armando montelongos real estate program from an infomercial and was very interested in it i have a background in real estate and wanted to learn more i had just aquired my first rental property at the time and was interested in having more rentals for the income the speakers at the threeday event were absolutely wonderful they seemed to have done what they were teaching which made it feel more doable the bus tour was great i liked it a lot im not very outgoing so the party jump up and down atmosphere was different for me i did ok with it though although i enjoyed going through the houses more seeing the houses and applying the system to them was great education they broke us up into teams and had some friendly competition i guess they are trying to help people like me who are more introverted and to get comfortable with networking the support that ive received from armandos group has been incredible ive been working with a mentor who is there to help in any way i need i was working on a deal and my mentor was with me every step of the way he spent so much time with me he was able to work with me on my computer remotely and was out of this world in his help ive also taken the master mentor threeday class i think the master mentors class was the best investment out of all the armando courses ive been working on a couple of deals so far and feel that soon something will go through i would recommend this programarmando montelongo companygina r ratedi first heard about armando’s program back in  from an infomercial we were in the middle of an investment when we saw the program we went to the oneday event which caught my attention and we went to the threeday event we learned that there are so many different directions to take this program there are people out there with money looking to invest and there are people who are ready to invest in properties but need funding we learned that we had options because we are a stable couple who have a lot of people who trust us and who would work with uswe took the bus tour in orlando florida knowing that we would have support after we left the bus tour was huge there was so much to learn we knew we would need follow up afterward the bus tour was just awesome i don’t have the best memory in the world but the fact that the speeches and information is stuck in my brain because of the way that he taught it was the enthusiasm and the chance we had to go experience it going through the houses was a way to connect what we had been learning we’ve made many connections with our local people and are able to work together with them we’ve done the master mentors and have kept up with the webinars we just bought our twelfth house we have one cash flow property but we’re mostly flipping we used hard money on one deal out of those twelve but the rest has been private fundingarmando montelongo companylisa marie s ratedi found out about armando montelongo last december  i had been up late at night and saw something on facebook about armando my husband and i had been thinking about flipping houses and since it was a free seminar i thought why not my husband works in construction and i’m studying for my real estate license so it made sense for us the training was a very enlightening experience they know their business informative energetic awesome experience it was good enough that we decided to do the bus tour in january in dallas texas it was a little crazy on the bus tour but it was a lot of fun educational and fun at the same time armando is an amazing individual he’s up front and honest and so far everything he’s told us has been true it’s all been a great experience if you don’t put skin in the game you won’t get it done i’ve been talking with people in the wolf pack i just sold my personal home and we purchased a new home the whole buying and closing simultaneously was crazy but our education helped immensely with the process armando’s teachings helped us decide what to pay to have someone else do the work on the house instead of doing it all ourselves besides the bus tour we’ve done asset protection tax lien master mentors and in june will be doing cash flow support from armando’s company has been amazing tremendous individuals ready to helparmando montelongo companygus j ratedmy wife and i were looking for an opportunity to learn about real estate when we saw armando on tv talking about his free seminar we did that and also the threeday seminar it was informative there wasnt any type of pressure to buy anything they just gave a lot of information the presenters seemed to be talking from experience we went down to miami for the bus tour because we felt that there was still some information that we needed that we didnt get at the threeday seminar the education we had at the bus tour was phenomenal the energy levels were great and it felt like a family it was enjoyable all questions were answered we had a great time and got the best educational experience weve ever had weve went to a long island meeting a while back and met some people who also do the program who weve kept in touch with we still do the webinars and conference calls those are the things were still doing with the armando montelongo program we have completed one flip and the process went well things work a little bit differently in new york so once we were acclimated to how things run here it was fine were now looking to find another property to flip phenomenal support from mentors when we need it they helped talk me through the deal their help relieved the little bit of anxiety that i had and helped me to make the dealarmando montelongo companyjessica r ratedmy business partner and i had never done anything involving real estate before but his father told us we should check this out so we decided to attend armando montelongo’s free event based on his recommendation we went on to the day event as i was interested in doing something different than my  job i was attracted to the idea of working for myself and having freedom as well as endless opportunities that are available in real estate the speakers shared their experiences and success stories which i very much could relate to i felt that because they didn’t come from a real estate background and they were doing it we could toothey got us really hyped up at the bus tour and got us to think differently about life and your potential my main takeaway was that you shouldn’t limit yourself they broke it out for us how simple it is yet at the same time a challenge to flip houses i’ve joined a couple of local groups in dallas to keep in touch and network with other people that armando has trained weve even had a few folks that weve met at these trainings stop by to visit with us while theyre in our city and have had the pleasure of showing them some of our housessince we have flipped  houses so far we’ve done pretty much all of the trainings available and have been highly satisfied with his systemdid you knowtypes of attorneysthe legal profession is vast with each

examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if

you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication
