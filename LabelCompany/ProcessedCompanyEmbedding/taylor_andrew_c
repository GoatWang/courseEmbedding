businesses many industries use open mouth bags to distribute their products and provide a crisp clean aesthetically appealing product at the point of sale  the wide top end of the open mouth bag allows for a variety of different products with widely varying mesh sizes bulk densities and flow characteristics to be packaged  the open mouth bagging scales that fill these containers can be either gross weigh or net weigh scales open mouth bags are typically constructed of kraft paper poly woven mesh plastic film or burlap all of these bags need to be closed after filling by using a sewing head heat sealer or pinch bag closer the process of open mouth bag filling begins with the placement of an empty bag on or below the fill spout of the bag scale for gross weighing the fill spout of the packer is suspended from an electronic load cell that accurately weighs the amount of product in the bag in net weigh applications the material is preweighed in scales above the open mouth bag filler then discharged into the open mouth bag the bag can be placed on the fill spout by hand or by an automated open mouth bag placer  once the bag is filled it is released and drops to the sewing conveyor belt transfer methods open mouth bag fillers can use a variety of methods to transfer the product from the bulk bin to the bag some of the most common techniques are as follows gravity scales use the bulk density and flow characteristics of the product to fill the open mouth bag by use of cutoff gates these gates close when the bag has reached the desired weight free flowing granular products such as grains fertilizer salt and small pellets are packaged on these scales vibratory feeder scales utilize side to side movement of the vibratory tray to transfer the product into the bag these scales use varying vibratory speeds to move difficult materials or to provide precise accurate measurements of granular material materials that do not flow easily or have irregular shapes such as ground coffee light density grass seed or granola usually incorporate vibration in open mouth bag fillers belt feeder scales are used for packaging material that tends to stick to itself during the fill process the belt feeder uses adjustable product height and speed settings to deliver the product into the open mouth bag accurately sweet molasses based cattle feed mulch and topsoil are bagged on belt feeder units auger packers feature a screw or auger that moves the product into the bag powders to granular material can be packaged with an auger packer open mouth bag filling using auger
