advice on managing the crc as a business opportunity the crc energy efficiency scheme also referred to as the ‘crc scheme’ or ‘crc’ is a mandatory carbon emissions reporting and pricing scheme to cover large public and private sector organisations in the uk excluding state funded schools in england from april  that use more than mwh per year of electricity and have at least one halfhourly meter settled on the halfhourly electricity market the scheme is managed on behalf of the uk governments department of energy  climate change decc by the environment agency in england by natural resources wales in wales by the scottish environment protection agency in scotland and by the northern ireland environment agency in northern ireland   the scheme is divided into a number of phases with each phase lasting five years currently the scheme is in its second phase running from april  to march  the uk government announced in  that the crc energy efficiency scheme will be abolished following the  compliance year    how it works the crc comprises three primary elements  emissions reporting requirement participants in the crc need to measure and report their electricity and gas supplies annually via the online crc registry following a specific set of measurement rules the crc registry then calculates crc emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide co from the data submitted for each participant the crc scheme applies to emissions not already covered by climate change agreements ccas and the eu emissions trading system eu ets in addition to reporting their electricity and gas supplies organisations are required to answer a set of corporate responsibility questions and keep evidence with records of their supplies as well as other relevant information    a carbon price the scheme requires participants to buy allowances for every tonne of carbon they emit relating to electricity and gas as reported under the scheme participants are required to buy allowances from the government or if available from the secondary market each year to cover their reported emissions this means that organisations that decrease their emissions can lower their costs under the crc a failure to surrender sufficient allowances will result in a financial penalty during phase  which started in april  there are two sales of allowances for each compliance year the first sale at the start of a compliance year is based on predicted emissions at a lower price the second is a buy to comply sale after the end of the compliance year at an expected higher price the price of the allowances for the  compliance year was set at £ per tonne of co for the forecast sale and £ per tonne of co at the “buy to comply” sale all future allowance prices will be published on the uk government crc web pages  publishing of information on participants energy use and emissions the energy use and emissions of all participants are published for each compliance year as part of the annual report publication arp which will also report emissions from previous years for all participants background to the scheme the sectors targeted by the carbon reduction commitment energy
