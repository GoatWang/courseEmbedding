addition a  administration charge is deducted under both contracts on the contract anniversary security benefit also assesses a premium tax charge to reimburse itself or premium taxes that it incurs in connection with a contract  an optional extra credit rider the “rider” under the contract makes available a credit enhancement “credit enhancement” which is an amount added to contract value by security benefit a contract holder must purchase the rider at issue if purchased a credit enhancement of   or  or purchase payments as elected in the application will be added to contract value for each purchase payment made in the first contract year any credit enhancement will be allocated among the subaccounts in the same proportion as the purchase payment is allocated  security benefit deducts a charge for the rider for a period of seven years from a contracts date of issue after the end of seven years from a contracts date of issue security benefit will no longer assess a charge for the rider and the credit enhancements will be fully vested the charge for this rider which is equal to a percentage on an annual basis of contract value varies based upon the interest rate selected by the contract holder as set forth below interest rate percentrider charge percent  the contracts permit contract holders to cancel their contracts and to receive a refund during the freelook period the freelook period generally is a day period beginning on the day a contract holder receives his or her contract if a contract holder returns a contract during the freelook period the contract will be canceled and treated as void from the contract date  in most instances a contract holder who returns a contract during the freelook period is entitled to a refund of his or her contract value plus any charges deducted from such contract value as of the end of the business day on which the contract is received for cancellation a contract holder will also receive a refund of any amounts that may have been deducted to pay for state premium taxes andor other taxes as is disclosed in the contract prospectus the value of any credit enhancement added to the contract value will be deducted if the contract holder returns the contract during the freelook period  in the event of a full or partial withdrawal under a contract with a rider in force security benefit will recapture all or part of any credit enhancement that has not yet vested an amount equal to  of the credit enhancement will vest as of each anniversary of the contracts date of issue and the credit enhancement will be fully vested at the end of seven years from that date the amount to be forfeited in the event of a withdrawal is equal to a percentage of the credit enhancement that has not yet vested the percentage is determined for each withdrawal as of the date of the withdrawal by dividing the amount of the withdrawal including any withdrawal charges by the contract value immediately prior to the withdrawal  the contracts provide for a death benefit upon the death of the contract holder prior to the annuity start date the death benefit proceeds will be the death benefit reduced by any outstanding loan balance including loan interest any pro rata account administration charge and any uncollected premium tax if a contract holder dies before the annuity start date the amount of the death benefit generally will be the greater of a the sum of all purchase payments not including credit enhancement if an extra credit rider was in effect less any reductions caused by previous withdrawals including withdrawal charges “purchase payment death benefit” or b the contract value on the date due proof of death and instructions regarding payment are received by security benefit less the amount of any credit enhancement applied during the  months prior to the date of the contract holders death if an extra credit rider was in effect “contract value death benefit” if a contract holder dies prior to the annuity start date and due proof of death and instructions regarding payment are not received by security benefit at its home office within six months of the date of the contract holders death the death benefit will be the contract value death benefit if a contract holder has purchased one of the following riders the death benefit will be as determined under the terms of the applicable rider a annual stepped up death benefit b guaranteed growth death benefit c combined annual stepped up and guaranteed growth death benefit and d combined guaranteed growth death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit each of those riders also excludes credit enhancements from any purchase payment death benefit and reduces the amount of any other death benefit by an amount equal to any credit enhancements applied during the  months prior to the date of the contract holders death  applicants seek exemptions pursuant to section c from sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the sbl insurers with respect to the contracts to a deduct from any full or partial withdrawal a proportionate amount of any credit enhancement that has not yet vested and b deduct from any death benefit except the purchase payment death benefit the amount of any credit enhancement applied during the  months prior to the date of the contract holders death the requested exemptions would also apply to any future contract funded by the separate accounts or future accounts that recapture credit enhancements provided that any such future contract is substantially similar in all material respects to the contractsstart printed page  applicants legal analysis  subsection i of section  of the  act provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such separate account except as provided in paragraph  of that subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless “a such contract is a redeemable security”  section a of the  act defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his or her proportionate shares of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants state that the amount paid in the event of a full or partial withdrawal excludes a proportionate amount of any credit enhancement conditionally applied to the contract in the seven years prior to the date of the full or partial withdrawal the amount of any death benefit that is based upon contract value does not include the amount of any credit enhancement conditionally applied to the contract in the  months prior to the date of the contract holders death in each instance the contract holder arguably is not receiving his or her proportionate share of applicable separate accounts thencurrent net assets applicants submit however that the recapture of the amount of any credit enhancement conditionally applied to the contract during the sevenyear period beginning on the date of issue of the contract or the month period prior to the date of the contract holders death would not deprive a contract holder of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets until or unless the credit enhancement is vested security benefit retains a right and interest in the credit enhancement the prospectus clearly discloses that for purposes of withdrawals a credit enhancement will vest only at the end of the sevenyear period beginning on the contracts date of issue the prospects also clearly discloses that for purposes of the death benefit a credit enhancement will vest only if it has been added to the contract value of a contract holder as of a date more than  months prior to the date of the contract holders death  applicants submit that annuity contracts unlike life insurance contracts are not intended to insure against the risk of the premature death of the insured instead annuity contracts are intended to provide an income stream to the contract holder or a named beneficiary for the life of the annuitant or for a period of years the risk to an insurer under an annuity contract typically is that the annuitant lives longer than the insurers prediction  according to the applicants if credit enhancements are applied unconditionally to the death benefit under an annuity contract before a minimum period of time has elapsed from the time that a credit enhancement has been credited the insurer runs the risk of adverse selection the insurer runs the risk that for example a terminally ill contract holder will make a large purchase payment in order to leverage the amount of money he or she is able to transfer to the beneficiary applicants that requiring a year to elapse before a credit enhancement may be included in a death benefit is an appropriate means to ensure that the contracts are not used as a riskfree vehicle for persons to leverage the amount of money they wish to transfer to a beneficiary  section c of the  act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c thereunder prohibits a registered investment company issuing a redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  applicants state that security benefits recapture of the credit enhancement with respect to the contracts in instances in which a a withdrawal is made and fewer than seven years have elapsed since the issue date of the contract or b a death benefit is paid other than the purchase payment death benefit and fewer than  months have elapsed between the time that the credit enhancement has been applied to the contract and the death of the contract holder might arguably be viewed as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the applicable subaccount of a separate account in other words because any such credit enhancement paid by security benefit is immediately added on a conditional basis to the contract value of certain contract holders and further because these amounts are allocated to certain subaccounts for the benefit of the participating contract holder the net asset value of each subaccount arguably is affected by these credits  applicants content however that the recapture of the credit enhancement under the circumstances described in the application should not be deemed to be a violation of section c and rule c to the extent that the recapture practices described in the application are considered to be technical violations of these provisions applicants request relief from section c and rule c in order to recapture credit enhancements as discussed above for the contracts and future contracts to the extent that an sbl insurer has provided credit enhancements to a control holder within a seven years of a full or partial withdrawal or b  months of the contract holders death before the annuity start date where the death benefit is not a purchase payment death benefit  applicants assert that the recapture of the credit enhancement does not involve either of the practices that rule c was intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable namely a the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or their redemption or repurchase at a price above it and b other unfair results including speculative trading practices  applicants submit that the proposed recapture of the credit enhancement poses no threat of dilution to effect a recapture of a credit enhancement security benefit redeems and the other sbl insurer will redeem interests in the subaccounts at a price determined on the basis of the current accumulation unit value of each of the subaccounts of the separate account in which the contract holders contract value is allocated the amount recaptured in the event of a full or partial withdrawal or death benefit will be equal to the amount of the credit enhancement paid out of the general account assets of security benefit that amount will be redeemed at the current accumulation unit value of the applicable subaccounts as of the date start printed page of receipt of the death claim or withdrawal request in proper order thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of a credit enhancement  applicants also submit that the second practice that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the credit enhancement conclusion for the reasons summarized above applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
