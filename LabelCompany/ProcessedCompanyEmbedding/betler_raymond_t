quarter last year key leaders albert j neupaver executive chairman raymond betler president and ceo patrick d dugan senior vice president and chief financial officer email newsletters sign up for one of our email newsletters raymond betler typically doesnt find new college graduates clamoring to work in the rail industry they dont consider it sexy enough said betler the ceo of wabtec corp a wilmerdingbased provider of rail industry products and services “people want to work for apple and google and at those places that have exercise rooms and glass windows and swimming pools” he said but his industry offers job security and innovation he said “its constantly changing it has compelling dynamics  it will grow in technology it will need to grow in productivity and at the same time it is a very stable industry” publicly traded wabtec is experiencing record sales earnings and margins — in part because of demand for its air braking equipment for freight cars and locomotives and the company continues to invest in product development and global expansion betler said “it is a very wellmanaged company with a very  basic strategy that they execute on” said art hatfield analyst and managing director of transportation research in the memphis office of raymond james financial inc “i think also oftentimes in business people overcomplicate things wabtec doesnt do that” diversification allowed the company to continue to post solid earnings results hatfield said though it has competitors in various products it doesnt have one competitor that competes in all of the products wabtec offers he said in addition to braking equipment wabtec produces electronics compressors brake shoes and pads door systems and current collectors it makes cooling systems for locomotives and the power generation market some of its biggest customers are general electric caterpillar inc union pacific corp bnsf railway co and new york city transit spokesman tim wesley said every locomotive freight car subway car or bus in north america probably contains some wabtec products he said seven years ago wabtec had  employees and  billion in sales betler said it now has more than  employees about  of whom are in western pennsylvania and  billion in sales betler cites four strategic growth initiatives global and market expansion new product development aftermarket products and services and acquisitions market expansion can mean going to untapped areas such as russia where wabtec is developing products to upgrade technology used with the countrys freight cars wabtec has an opportunity to customize brake pads for russias fleet that uses cast iron brake shoes he said wabtecs operations in more than  countries sell products to more than  countries it has about  percent of the market share on all transit agencies braking systems in north america and is expanding that reach worldwide for example after partnering with passenger rail agency of south africa a few years ago wabtec now supplies  braking systems for vehicles used in its rail system more than  acquisitions over eight years have supplemented the companys growth about  billion in business has been acquired in the past decade among its significant acquisitions was last years  million purchase of fandstan electric group ltd a londonbased company that makes power collection products such as those used to power trolley systems it helped wabtec to expand into europe and add a product to its portfolio the  million acquisition of park ridge illbased standard car truck a rail equipment supplier in  allowed wabtec to increase its overall portfolio in the freight area now its shortterm goal is to continue improving and its longterm goal is to double revenue in five years betler said challenges vary by location in north america its the dramatic price drop in oil and gas which has led to a decline in the transportation of energyrelated products in russia its geopolitical issues and in greece economic instability also overall shipping volumes in the rail industry have been down for several months “so we may have kind of hit a cyclical peak in that” hatfield said customers often ask if wabtec has gone as far is it can with expansion betler said but he said “our economy is totally dependent on the industry were just blessed to be part of it” tory n parrish is a trib total media staff
