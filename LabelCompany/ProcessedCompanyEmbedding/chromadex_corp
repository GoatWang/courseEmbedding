products immulina anthorigin patents   niagen®—the world’s first and only commercially available nicotinamide riboside nr what is niagen® niagen® also known as nicotinamide riboside nr is a very unique member of the vitamin b family the body converts nr into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad which is an essential molecule found in every living cell why is nad so important nad enables cells to convert the food that we eat into the energy that we need nad is also the communication molecule between the cell nucleus and the mitochondria which are the energy producing factories in the cell if nad levels are low then communication may be impaired and mitochondria dysfunction may result when this occurs everything begins to breakdown boosting nad levels promote cellular metabolism mitochondrial function and energy production   why is niagen® so revolutionary the cruel reality is nad levels are highest at birth and decreases dramatically with age also certain lifestyle choices such as overeating or a sedentary routine deplete nad levels in a recent human study one serving of niagen® increased nad levels by  in  hours   claims supported by science increases nad levels in cells and tissues supports healthy skin promotes mitochondrial function which is an important component of aging promotes beneficial effects on blood lipids by maintaining healthy cholesterol levels

results confirm that nr increases the mitochondrial coenzyme nad and is safe   full study results to be peer reviewed for scientific publication  irvine calif feb   prnewswire  chromadex corp otcqx cdxc announced today that the initial results of the first human clinical study for the companys niagen® nicotinamide riboside nr has met its primary endpoint the results demonstrated that a single dose of nr resulted in statistically significant increases in the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad in healthy human volunteers the study shows for the first time a similar conversion of nr into nad as has been shown in prior animal studies maintenance of sufficient levels of nad is key to cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function if nad levels go down or are redirected as in cancer cells mitochondrial function erodes creating numerous adverse effects for example results of a mouse study conducted by the national institutes of health nih in collaboration with chromadex published in november  indicated that nr was effective at restoring nad levels in mitochondria and rescuing phenotypes associated with a devastating accelerated aging disease known as cockayne syndrome cs the researchers concluded that nr showed promise as a potential therapy for the disease as well as for other agerelated neurodegenerative conditions in the first human clinical study of niagen® nad metabolomic analyses were completed in blood for various time points over a hour period for the first time the study also established an effective dose range for nr in humans a preliminary analysis of the results did not reveal any safety issues with nr which is consistent with previous safety results demonstrated in numerous cell and animal studies the full results of the study will be submitted for peer review in the scientific literature the nad metabolomics analyses were performed in the laboratory of dr charles brenner the roy j carver chair of biochemistry and professor of internal medicine at the university of iowa in  brenner who was then a faculty member at dartmouth college discovered nr to be a vital precursor of nad which is made available by nicotinamide riboside kinases nrks that are conserved between yeast and humans in  dr brenners lab discovered a second pathway by which nr is converted to nad and showed that nr can extend the lifespan of yeast cells by virtue of elevating nad levels and increasing the activity of the naddependent sir enzyme  dr brenner commented the results of this study constitute a significant milestone in the translation of nr technologies as it is the first time an increase in nad in humans has been demonstrated through nr supplementation as noted in numerous scientific studies the potential health and therapeutic benefits of nr as a precursor to nad are significant the results of this clinical study should encourage more studies and research regarding the possible health benefits of nr in humans nobel laureate dr roger kornberg who chairs chromadexs scientific advisory board commented demonstrating that nr is an effective precursor to increase nad in humans has significant positive implications and may be a cornerstone to developing solutions to delay or reverse the effects of aging obesity and disease frank jaksch jr founder and ceo of chromadex commented we believe the confirmation that a single dose of nr increases nad in humans is a landmark result and a significant bridge between the numerous animal studies previously conducted that have demonstrated not only an increase in nad but also a broad range of therapeutic benefits jaksch continued dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism in mitochondria is increasingly implicated in diseases of aging autoimmune diseases muscle wasting neuropathies and other conditions and this study opens the door to the development of both consumer products and pharmaceuticals addressing these conditions chromadexs niagen® is the only commercially available form of nr and is supported by five patents issued and several pending with patents rights acquired from dartmouth college cornell university and washington university published research has shown that nr is perhaps the most effective precursor to boost the coenzyme nad in the cell nad is arguably the most important cellular cofactor for improvement of mitochondrial performance and energy in recent years nad has also been shown to participate as an extracellular signaling molecule in celltocell communication nad is essential in supporting healthy cellular metabolism including the efficient conversion of blood glucose into energy  as organisms age nad levels drop which leads to a decrease in mitochondrial health this in turn leads to agerelated health issues low nad levels limit the activity of a group of enzymes called sirtuins which are believed to play key roles in longevity nad levels can be depleted by many of the stresses of life by boosting nad nr can increase mitochondrial health and induce creation of new mitochondria about nicotinamide riboside nrsometimes referred to as the hidden vitamin nr is found naturally in trace amounts in milk and other foods and is a more potent noflush version of niacin vitamin b researchers around the world are studying the effect of nr on mitochondria the powerhouses of the cell where macronutrients are converted to energy the cell can use mitochondria also play an important part in the aging process scientists hope that the stimulation of mitochondrial function with nr may result in increased longevity as well as other health improvements researchers worldwide are continuing to make  seminal discoveries characterizing the unique properties of nr in a wide range of health benefits including increased mitochondrial health increased muscle endurance neuroprotection sirtuin activation protection against weight gain on highfat diet protection against oxidative stress and improvement of blood glucose and insulin sensitivity while scientists have known for decades that mitochondria produce energy for cells it is only recently that mitochondrial function has been linked to general health aging and numerous disease conditions key to mitochondrial function is the maintenance of sufficient levels of nad which is used to generate energy efficiently and allows overall mitochondria function such as signaling immune regulation and cell death to proceed properly if levels go down or are redirected as in cancer cells mitochondrial function erodes creating numerous adverse effects scientists have begun to show in animal models that the stimulation of mitochondrial function with nr may result in increased longevity as well as other health improvements at the same time mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly linked to a broad range of disease conditions including autoimmune diseases macular degeneration cancer alzheimers and other central nervous system diseases duchenne muscular dystrophy and others a study by researchers from harvard medical school conducted in conjunction with the national institute on aging and published in december  in cell demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction a hallmark of aging in aging mice is due to a disruption in sirtuindependent nuclearmitochondrial communication the study further showed that a reduction in nad levels is responsible for this disruption excitingly the study demonstrated that this mitochondrial dysfunction is readily reversible by the administration of a nad precursor the study reported that one week of treatment with a compound that boosts nad levels is sufficient to restore the mitochondrial homeostasis and key biochemical markers of muscle health in a monthold mouse to levels similar to a sixmonthold mouse indicating that some aspects of aging may be theoretically reversible separately findings from a  study conducted by researchers at weill cornell medical college and the ecole polytechnique federale de lausanne switzerland showed that mice on a highfat diet that were fed nr gained  percent less weight than mice eating the same highfat diet without nr moreover unlike the mice that were not fed nr none of the nrtreated mice had indications that they were developing diabetes and their energy and lower cholesterol levels improved all without side effects the swiss researchers were quoted as saying the effects of nr on metabolism were nothing short of astonishing about chromadex        chromadex is an innovative natural products company that

from university ars march   by admin oxford miss – a natural products chemistry company has licensed the rights for a promising botanical compound from the university of mississippi and the agricultural research service which is the principal intramural scientific research agency of the us department of agriculture chromadex corp has signed an agreement for the commercial development of pterostilbene terostillbean a compound found in blueberries grapes and other small fruits as well as the bark of some trees in laboratory tests it shows promise for improving cardiovascular health glucose levels and cognitive function “pterostilbene has the potential to be one of the most significant new ingredients the dietary supplement field has seen in a long time” said frank l jaksch jr cofounder and ceo of chromadex “based on the technology we licensed from the university of mississippi and the usda chromadex will be announcing the commercial application of this ingredient marketed as pteropure pterostilbene in the coming weeks” pterostilbene is chemically related to resveratrol a compound that is plentiful in the skins of red grapes resveratrol is thought to be at least partly responsible for the health benefits attributed to drinking red wine which include cardiovascular health and cancer prevention research chemist agnes rimando first encountered pterostilbene when she was a graduate student at the university of chicago rimando works with the usda agricultural research service natural products utilization research unit housed in the um national center for natural products research when studies in the s suggested that resveratrol provided substantial health benefits rimando began experimenting with pterostilbene in hopes of finding similar activity in  rimando asked dennis feller former um professor and chair of pharmacology and wallace yokoyama at usdaars western regional research center in albany calif to collaborate on studies of the compound targeting a particular protein in cells that is involved in fatty acid metabolism and transport results of their work were presented at the american chemical society meeting in  and attracted widespread attention including coverage on national and international tv and radio stations and mentions in time parade and other consumer magazines the development of pterostilbene as a potential dietary supplement demonstrates the value of collaborations between the school of pharmacy ncnpr and usdaars said barbara g wells dean of the um pharmacy school “these types of projects allow us to share expertise and help solve problems related to the health and wellbeing of people everywhere” wells said “we actively seek partnerships with other academic institutions and state and federal agencies and we are pleased that this particular partnership has yielded such encouraging results” the licensing agreement with chromadex is a prime example of how academic research can promote economic development said walt chambliss um director of technology management “chromadex is just the kind of company we want to work with” chambliss said “they know the value of our research and that’s the key ingredient in a partnership like this “um and usdaars researchers working at ole miss share a common desire to translate research into commercial products we couldn’t be happier about our agreement with chromadex it’s just further testament to the ability of our researchers to do work that attracts commercial interest” chromadex corp otcbb cdxc based in california is a leader in the development of phytochemical and botanical reference standards and the creation of associated intellectual property the public company is committed to sustainable “green chemistry” and provides the dietary supplement food beverage nutraceutical and cosmetic industries with analytical tools products and services the national center for natural products research a unit based in the um school of pharmacy is the nation’s only university research center devoted to improving human health and agricultural productivity through the discovery development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals derived from plants marine organisms and other natural products the usdaars natural products utilization research unit focuses on discovery of natural productbased pest management
