a gripping adventure yarn and a poignant satisfying againstallodds romance the authors breathe vibrant life into a lesserknown period of colonial history presenting memorable engaging characters i have really loved this entire series this is the third book and i highly recommend reading the first two books by the third book you have fully invested in the characters and are very interested in every aspect of their stories out of the three daughters of harwood house books lilys plight is my favoritelaity and crawford address the dangers of battle and how families in the early settlements needed to work together to succeed the struggle with faith love and family are woven throughout the novel it was a beautiful conclusion to the harwood family this was a satisfying conclusion to an enjoyable trilogy set in the early days of colonial settlement an avid history buff i thoroughly enjoyed the inclusion of the american militia’s struggle against invading french and indians the tense action between the indians and homesteaders and the struggles our early colonists faced  i most enjoyed the deep emotional battles that lily and john faced on an almost daily basis they feel guilt pain reaffirmation of faith and a myriad of other emotions the authors have done an excellent job in writing a gripping historical page turner filled with anxious moments and ultimately the peace and love that two people can find with god’s grace product reviews▼▲  stars out of   out of   stars   stars   stars   stars   star  quality  out of   out of  value  out of   out of  meets expectations

i enjoyed the story the second book mariahs quest was not so good and i would not read it again i was hoping that this third book would get back to the likes of the first book for me well it was not as bad as the second but still not a favorite of mine i have this book  stars i though the characters were well portrayed but sometimes their personalities conflicted with what they actually did i just could not fall in love with them and that makes it hard to read about their lives i would recommend you read the others in the series first but it is not a necessity i would recommend this book

female quality  value  meets expectations  lilys plight the third and final installment of the harwood house trilogy written by sally laity and dianna crawford and published by barbour press closes the stories of three british sisters who for their own individual reasons sold themselves into indenturement in america lily harwood the youngest of the sisters served the waldon family willingly and with joy for the four years of her indenturement she cared for susan waldon the beloved and terminally ill wife and mother as well as mothering the four young waldon children placed in her care the only dark spots in her life are the constant threat of indian attacks on the wilderness settlement and her burgeoning love for the waldon family patriarch john with john often gone from the homestead serving in the colonial militia the burdens of farming homemaking and warriorlife fell to lily when her chance comes to leave the homestead lily must decide where she truly wants to be  with john and his children or with her nowwealthy sister mariah enjoying a life of ease more suited to her upbringing i was thrilled to be given the opportunity to review lilys plight i truly enjoyed laity and crawfords earlier series freedoms holy light and knew that this newest series would carry the rich historical detail genuine characters and wellpaced plot that i was accustomed to from their earlier work i did not have a chance to read the first two books in the harwood house series roses pledge and mariahs quest but i didnt find that this hindered my reading of lilys plight the historical detail was a very accurate in some ways i wished laity and crawford would have softened the emotions of the settlers toward the raiding indians just to make it a little easier to read however their characterizations of both the indians and the colonials as pawns in the war between the french and british was spoton i think a little modernism may have been added when treating the possible romantic entanglements for lily it seemed to me that the young men were quite forward in both speech and mannerisms but then again life on the frontier did not have the ultracivilized restrained atmosphere of a colonial city the romantic tensions between lily and john were wellplayed out through the whole story thankfully as expected laity and crawford did not leave that tension as the only one family disputes indian attacks military fiascoes and spiritual growth all work together to move the story of lily along at a moderate pace no breakneck racing toward the finish line of this story but neither does the book bog down at any point i am very interested in picking up a copy of both roses pledge and mariahs quest to find out these sisters stories i give lilys plight  stars was this review

quality  value  meets expectations  sally laity  dianna crawford in their new book lilys plight book three in the daughters of harwood house series published by barbour publishing inc brings us into the life of lily harwood in the turbulent  from the back cover their greatest challenge is yet to come lily harwood always considered herself a good christian lass but after years of serving the waldon family and despite the fact that she loves them dearly her life has grown increasingly difficult and frightening daily she watches susan waldons health deteriorate and with john waldon away with the militia protecting them from attack by the french and indians lily is responsible for the entire farmstead ever since johns last child was born over four years ago hes had to watch helplessly as his beloved wife suffers with a mysterious and debilitating illness and because of the drawnout conflict hes torn between wanting to be with his family and knowing that thwarting the enemy on the frontier is the best way to protect them but when he returns home on a short furlough both john and lily face a deeper more profound plight they find themselves falling in love caught between passion and sorrow in harrowing times their only hope lies in the promises of god the dictionary defines plight as a solemnly given or an unfortunate difficult or precarious situation lily harwood lives up to both definitions she gave her solemnity or promise to serve in the waldon household and her situation is proving difficult as she is now in love with a married man can you imagine selling yourself into servanthood to pay off your fathers debt lilys sister rose thought so and the three sisters came from england to america to do so rose and mariahs stories were told in the previous two books now it is lilys turn i like history and lilys plight is loaded with it it is set against the background of the french and indian war and lily is an indentured servant trying to hold together a family that is seemingly falling apart lily has come to love this family however she has come to love john more and this is dangerous because he is married to susan can she remain pure while the war happens around her and her own emotions threaten to overwhelm her i wont give it all away except to say that the thrill ride that this story turns out to be has some real surprises before we find out that answer lilys plight is a great read filled with drama romance history and suspense i recommend this book highly i am sorry to see this series end but i am looking forward to more from these very talented authors disclosure of material connection i received this book free from barbour publishing inc i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have expressed are my own i am

flag as inappropriate english lady uk age  gender female  stars out of  about average fare january   english lady uk age  gender female this review was written for lilys plight harwood house series  ebook this novel is a last in a trilogy though the first i have read by these authors so i was not familiar with the background of the story or the characters or with their writing style reading it also represented something of a new experience for me as i generally opt for books of this genre set in europe or in the medieval period i am british and a medievalist in training so i prefer these and i am not really familiar with american history the period when this story is set in general this said i have to say i was not greatly impressed by this story i have read quite a few historical romances in my time and this one seemed about the average run of the mill type of story in this genre it was enjoyable enough but i would say nothing special even the hint of ã¢â¬ëforbidden love in the sense of lily falling for her master in spite of herself when she knows she shouldnt and him doing the same has been ã¢â¬ëdone before and felt perhaps felt a little clichãâd so lily and johns love story is sweet but rather predictable in spite of both parties trying to suppress and quash their feelings for one another in spite of them being separated by war and hardship in spite of everything was almost inevitable that they would eventually get their happy ending the religious content seemed to be woven into the story well and there was nothing that seemed objectionable or questionable in a theological sense without intending to be irreverent or disrespectful i would say the theme and subject matter was about standard fare for inspirational historical novels of this kind not that i suggest or expect that christian authors should change the christian content or write anything ã¢â¬ënew to pander to readers the point as that this like the novel is just about the same as a lot of others of this type the one aspect that did stand out for me was the question of why god does not always seem to answer prayer and sometimes seems to let bad things happen if felt this was addressed sensitively decisively and rather well another aspect which seemed to be a reflection of the time period was the depiction of the native americans as barbarian savages people now might find this objectionable but i did not personally as it seemed a plausible enough presentation of the way that people living in the environment and circumstances of the characters might have viewed them if the only contact they had with native americans was when they saw or heard of them raiding and burning settlements killing people or kidnapping their children it did not seem surprising that they would view them in such a way then there was the setting itself it seemed to me a very idealised and romanticised version of good old fashioned rural american life with characters who could have stepped off the set of little house on the prairie the honest decent robust hard workin folk of beaver cove might have been pleasant enough but they seemed to lack depth and be a little too perfect and sweet to be real yes they faced hardships but they all muscled in together to help each other out and everythin came alright in the end not like wealthy them city who are almost all presented as living in luxury and as being too concerned with trivial things like clothes and balls and their social status or elegant wives to worry about much else that is important the british almost universally seemed to be depicted as cowards weaklings or bungling fools whose commanders could or would not defend the their territory or help each other and seemed to do little except sit in their fortresses and surrender at the first hint of an attack and who literally had to be forced to take any kind of decisive action in the war it was of course the tough rugged ã¢â¬ëcolonials in other words the americans who did most of the real fighting and the ones who seemed to make the real difference the stereotyping went further when the brits like the city folk were almost all depicted as genteel types from rich or affluent backgrounds who never did much tough physical labour like the waldons of beaver cove lily is presented as having been thus before she came to america and adopted the good life eye  roll inducing stereotyping once again where i had hoped the depiction of nonamerican people might be more informed or objective then there were the accents as stated before i am not american i am british so i am not familiar with the nuances of regional american accents yet i could not help questioning whether there really would have been such a pronounced difference between the accents of americans and british people at this time as there was in the story somehow the accents of the american characters seemed a little too modern and their use of some anachronistic terms and phrases which did not exist in the mids seemed to confirm this the only two major nonamerican characters as stated before were lily and scotsman who served as the preacher or pastor in beaver cove he spoke with what seemed to be a ridiculously exaggerated accent and lilys was little better overall this novel was enjoyable enough but it was really not my proverbial ã¢â¬ëcup of tea there did not seem to be anything much to set it apart from other novels in this genre but it is passable enough a light clean and moderately enjoyable read i am interested in perhaps reading the preceding two novels though i dont think i would buy them if you like these authors and novels set in this period it might be for you thanks to netgalley and barbour for providing me with a free electronic copy of

pay her fathers debt that plan included selling herself as bond servant to the colonies a dirty old man named smith bought rose to become his cook the man is a fur trader and lives on a trading post

rose to the trading post and starts to have feelings for rose rose is a dedicated christian and nate isnt so shes trying to guard her heart but is attracted to him nevertheless it took me a while to get into the story but once i did i really liked the story i loved reading about the untamed wilderness how they traveled and crossed rivers always on guard for enemy indians and frenchmen also interesting to read was how the fur trading was done i liked to read how rose adapted to life in the wilderness how she learned the fur trade and became a tough lady for the lover of historical

interdisciplinary approach ark of civilization refugee scholars and oxford university  edited by sally crawford katharina ulmschneider and jaś elsner description in the opening decades of the twentieth century germany was at the cutting edge of arts and humanities scholarship across europe however when many of its key thinkersleaders in their fields in classics philosophy archaeology art history and oriental studieswere forced to flee to england following the rise of the nazi regime germanys loss became oxfords gain from the mids onwards oxford could accurately be described as an ark of knowledge of western civilization a place where ideas about art culture and history could be rescued developed and disseminated freely the citys history as a place of refuge for scientists who were victims of nazi oppression is by now familiar but the story of its role as a sanctuary for cultural heritage though no less important has received much less attention in this volume the impact of oxford as a shelter a meeting point and a center of thought in the arts and humanities specifically is addressed by looking both at those who sought refuge there and stayed and those whose lives intersected with oxford at crucial moments before and during the war although not every great refugee can be discussed in detail in this volume this study offers an introduction to the unique conjunction of place people and time that shaped western intellectual history exploring how the meeting of minds enabled by libraries publishing houses and the university allowed oxfords refugee scholars to have a profound and lasting impact on the development of british culture drawing on oral histories previously unpublished letters and archives it illuminates and interweaves both personal and global histories to demonstrate how for a short period during the war oxford brought together some of the greatest minds of the age to become the custodians of a great european civilization show
