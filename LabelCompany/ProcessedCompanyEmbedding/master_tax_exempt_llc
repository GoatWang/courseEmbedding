fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality shortterm taxexempt securities these securities consist principally of taxexempt notes and commercial paper shortterm taxexempt bonds taxexempt variable rate demand obligations and shortterm taxexempt derivatives certain shortterm securities have maturities that are longer than  days but give the fund the right to demand payment from a financial institution within that period the fund treats these securities as having a maturity of  days or less the funds dollarweighted average maturity will be  days or less and the dollarweighted average life of all of its investments will be  days or less   under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its assets in shortterm taxexempt securities or so that at least  of the income it distributes will be exempt from federal income tax including the federal alternative minimum tax the fund also may invest up to  of its assets in shortterm municipal securities which may subject investors to federal alternative minimum tax throughout this prospectus interest paid on taxexempt andor municipal securities may be referred to as taxexempt   the fund does not presently intend to invest more than  of its total assets in shortterm taxexempt securities of issuers located in a single state    principal risks of investing in the fund   taxexempt fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve its objectives   an investment in the fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the fund could lose money if the issuer of an instrument held by the fund defaults or if shortterm interest rates rise sharply in a manner not anticipated by fund management although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at  per share it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund the following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the fund   n   credit risk  credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the funds investment in that issuer   n   income risk  income risk is the risk that the funds yield will vary as shortterm securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest rates   n   interest rate risk  interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise in general the market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter term securities     additionally securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity however due to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of such securities may vary during the period shareholders own shares of the fund   n   market risk and selection risk  market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the fund invests will go down in value including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by fund management will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies this means you may lose money   n   municipal securities risks  municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation the relative lack of information about certain issuers of municipal securities and the possibility of future legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities certain municipal securities including private activity bonds are not backed by the full faith credit and taxing power of the issuer additionally if events occur after the security is acquired that impact the securitys taxexempt status the fund and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax liabilities   n   taxability risk  future laws regulations rulings or court decisions may cause interest on taxexempt or municipal securities to be subject directly or indirectly to federal income taxation or may otherwise prevent the fund from realizing the full current benefit of the taxexempt status of such securities any such change could also affect the market price of such securities and thus the value of an investment in the fund   n   variable rate demand obligations and municipal or taxexempt derivatives risk  investments in variable rate demand obligations or shortterm municipal or taxexempt derivatives involve credit risk with respect to the financial institution providing the fund with the right to demand payment or put sell the security while the fund invests only in shortterm municipal or taxexempt securities of high quality issuers or which are backed by high quality financial institutions those issuers or financial institutions may still default on their obligations shortterm municipal or taxexempt derivatives present certain unresolved tax legal
