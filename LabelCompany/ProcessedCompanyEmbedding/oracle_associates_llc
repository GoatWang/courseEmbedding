penetration with webfocus food industry aggregator uses information builders solutions to create global view of critical information topco associates llc a privately held grocery cooperative provides innovative business solutions for its food industry memberowners and customers focused on developing procuring and delivering storewide product and service solutions primarily focused around a retailer’s private label offerings topco leverages the collective volume knowledge and commitment of its  memberowners to create a competitive advantage in the retail marketplace and boasts annual sales in excess of  billion topco recently selected information builders to resolve its business intelligence bi data integration and information integrity challenges – the backbone of a fiveyear information technology modernization project the goal of this initiative is to enhance information intelligence practices that in turn will speed time to market and improve results for members topco purchased information builders’ webfocus bi platform to create and deliver intelligent dashboards that produce insight at a glance and reports that provide topco management with a simpler and more effective way of answering questions without constant assistance from the it staff “we wanted to standardize our data upstream so we can present it more easily and accurately downstream” says russell mann a director of finance at topco associates “after a careful evaluation we engaged information builders to construct a data lifecycle management framework that helps us deliver accurate information for both operational and reporting needs” exposing the data topco’s business goals include reducing product costs and increasing private label penetration to help its members compete with larger national competitors one of the project’s early objectives was to expose operational and sales data in ways the business could quickly assess and respond getting to basic data was not easy due to topco’s diverse backend infrastructure the company has numerous departmental database applications along with about two dozen offline data marts serving specific needs for example it stores the core operational information in an ibm db database on an as4 computer product information in various microsoft sql server databases and domainspecific information about certain product categories in a cloudbased solution from an application service provider asp lacking data governance standards it wasn’t clear which department was responsible for which data “our previous information management practices were labor intensive and inefficient” admits mann “over the years different groups had begun to use the data in different ways without always taking the time to coordinate their activities according to internal estimates the cost to maintain master data was four times higher than it should be and it took too long to develop new products which was limiting growth” the grocery industry operates on extremely slim margins averaging  percent to  percent operational expenses are always scrutinized and it dollars must be spent carefully while some consultants advised topco to implement a new enterprise resource planning erp system the topco team was leery of embarking on such a project instead mann and his colleagues decided to engage information builders to help them improve the information systems that they already have and to create a framework of data that will support new technologies when necessary information builders competed against all of the other players in the bi segment topco picked information builders because of the robust solutions for business intelligence and data governance which are flexible enough to work with and bring together existing technologies it is this unified data framework created by the information builders’ technologies that will support topco’s business transformation into a true datadriven company “now we are using data to drive our business transformation” explains mann “information builders’ integrated suite of solutions let us expose data consistently so people can respond to changes in a fast and effective way” leading with business intelligence mann and his team are approaching the modernization project with two initial phases during phase one they created a sales data warehouse that feeds webfocus dashboards branded “topfacts” this dashboard has several different tabs for monitoring sales by program customer and brand along with an analysis tab that lets program managers buyers and analysts examine the sales data embedded charts and graphs are dynamically updated with new data so people don’t have to go looking for information topfacts includes canned reports as well as an ad hoc reporting tab that permits detailed drilldowns several reports address fill rates allowing users to analyze information about items that have been warehoused ordered shipped and received from vendors employees across the organization use the new bi environment about  suppliers their memberowners and customers will access it in the near future webfocus can access many databases directly alleviating the need to build and maintain multiple data warehouses “we liked webfocus because it can work across multiple platforms to combine information both online and offline and we look forward to utilizing this as we develop on their platform” says mann in phase two topco is turning its attention to data quality and data governance by creating a single reference point for common data elements such as vendor member item and price topco is improving its fundamental processes for ensuring data accuracy streamlining data exchange and creating a flexible data framework for new technology applications “there is no point in deploying new bi technology without first standardizing the data” explains mann “otherwise you will end up with unique reporting domains that lack consistency with each other” expanding the scope of analysis on the bi front topco is adding customer service data to the warehouse and creating new dashboards for products customer service labeling and other domains the company plans to use infoassist to replace microsoft access and excel applications with a more cohesive enduser reporting environment “creating reporting objects from the data warehouse then pointing infoassist at those objects will improve consistency by eliminating private applications and data sources that don’t always agree with each other” explains mann mann also looks forward to the new analytic capabilities in the most recent release of webfocus for example he wants to use maps to frame results and a tagword cloud to visualize call center data so customer service personnel can more easily spot common skus and vendors in support threads similar to sentiment analysis this type of patternmatching could help customer service personnel to detect recurring problems quickly topco is eliminating several thirdparty reporting environments as it standardizes on the information builders product set including an oracle hyperion environment for operational sales and purchasing reporting that it plans to enhance and replace with webfocus performance management framework pmf analysts are defining key performance indicators and cascading scorecards that extend from corporatelevel goals to departmental directives pmf facilitates this process with predefined templates for dashboards analytics and user management along with multilevel scorecards to help managers monitor performance against stated targets “instead of measuring progress year over year we will be able to roll out a granular performance management environment that lets us set interim goals and extend accountability throughout the business” says mann while topco is just beginning to see the fruits of its extensive modernization efforts mann believes that their early success with webfocus proves that they are on the right path “the tools are all in place” he sums up “as we improve the quality and consistency of our data the potential impact on the business will be tremendous” the organization topco associates provides procurement quality assurance packaging and other services for its  memberowners the challenge reduce product costs and increase private label penetration to differentiate topco’s members from large national competitors boost the average fill rate to  percent to create a leaner distribution model the strategy create a single reference point for common data elements improve fundamental processes for ensuring data quality develop reports and dashboards to access information from production databases the results topco’s business intelligence bi initiatives
