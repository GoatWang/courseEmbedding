my research lies at the boundary between cosmology particle physics and astrophysics  in particular i am interested in dark matter dark energy cosmological inflation and particle astrophysics  i have

information regarding eligibility including academic and english language requirements is available from the online prospectus   for further details contact prof malcolm fairbairn and or the postgraduate tutor dr cedric weber   phd projects the world of cosmology and particle physics can move quite quickly and it is difficult to say precisely what a student will be working on at any given moment two years in the future  there are however common features of all phd theses undertaken with me  you will certainly work on more than one topic i will try and ensure you have expertise in more than one area of the subject by the time you come to write up your thesis you will develop and employ a range of both analytic and numerical skills to attack particular problems  students are always encouraged to come up with their own research ideas within the thesis either by taking an idea i give them and then expanding upon it or by coming up with something completely original on their own  i will help them winnow down ideas and bring good ones to fruition having explained this approach i will list some areas within which my students and i are active there is plenty of new work to be done in each  the dark matter  lhc connection it is thought that there is  times as much invisible dark matter in the universe as there is normal matter there are three ways of detecting this dark matter the first is by producing it at a collider the second is by detecting it as it interacts with baryonic targets in experiments and the third is when we look for the particles produced when two dark matter particles collide and annihilate with each other in order to understand the nature of dark matter work needs to be done to make a link between these three different approaches work which involves astrophysics cosmology and some particle physics inflation a period of exponential expansion in the early universe solves many problems in cosmology including why the cosmos is so large and uniform  many people think this could be due to an inflaton field which dominates the energy density in the early universe quantum fluctuations in this field end up forming the seeds of structure we see today such as galaxies   the main aim is to make a link between what can be observed and physics in the early universe especially now we are learning more about the higgs field and potentially physics beyond the standard model from observations at the lhc  work in this area would involve cosmology general relativity and hopefully particle physics since the ultimate aim of the inflationary program is to understand the particle physics of the inflaton field and how it relates to the other fields we know exist such as the particles around us today i am always looking for motivated capable

june   journal of cosmology and astroparticle physics we investigate the possibility of using the only known fundamental scalar the higgs as an inflaton with minimal coupling to gravity the peculiar appearance of a plateau or a false vacuum in the renormalised effective scalar potential suggests that the higgs might drive inflation for the case of a false vacuum we use an additional singlet scalar field motivated by the strong cp problem and its coupling to the higgs to lift the barrier allowing for a graceful exit from inflation by mimicking hybrid inflation we find that this scenario is incompatible with current measurements of the higgs mass andmore » the qcd coupling constant and conclude that the higgs can only be the inflaton in more complicated scenarios« less full text

cosmology and astroparticle physics inflationary models based on a single scalar field φ with a quadratic potential v  ½m we study the robustness of this result with respect to variations of the wimp velocity distribution in our galaxy by changing various parameters of the distribution function and by using the results of a realistic nbody dark matter simulation we find that only by making rather extreme assumptions regarding halo properties can we obtain agreement between dama and cdmsxenon« less full text available cosmic acceleration in models with density dependent moduli fairbairn malcolm october   physical review d particles fields the effective equation of state of normal matter is changed in theories where the size of the compact space depends upon the local energy density in particular we show how the dilution of a fluid due to the expansion of the universe can be compensated by an increase of the effective coupling of that fluid to gravity in the presence of a potential which acts to reduce the size of the compact space we estimate how much cosmic acceleration can be obtained in such a model and comment on the difficulties faced in finding an appropriate potential full text available capture of inelastic dark matter in white dwarves mccullough matthew  fairbairn malcolm  physics kings college london strand wcr ls april   physical review d particles fields we consider the capture of inelastic dark matter in white dwarves by inelastic spinindependent scattering on nuclei we show that if the dark matter annihilates to standardmodel particles then under the assumption of primordial globular cluster formation the observation of cold white dwarves in the globular cluster m appears inconsistent with explanations of the observed damalibra annual modulation signal based on spinindependent inelastic dark matter scattering alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standardmodel particles then this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core ofmore » m than would be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo finally we argue that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe complementary to other direct and indirect detection searches« less full text available simplified models for dark matter searches at the lhc abdallah jalal  araujo henrique  arbey alexandre   september   physics of the dark universe this document a outlines a set of simplified models for dark matter and its interactions with standard model particles it is intended to summarize the main characteristics that these simplified models have when applied to dark matter searches at the lhc and to provide a number of useful expressions for reference the list of models includes both schannel and tchannel scenarios for schannel spin and spin mediations are discussed and also realizations where the higgs particle provides a portal between the dark and visible sectors the guiding principles underpinning the proposed simplified models are spelled out and some suggestions formore » implementation are presented« less full text available « prev select page number go to
