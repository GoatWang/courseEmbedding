his death on march  robert b silvers was doing what he had been doing every day for the past fiftyfour years thinking about fretting over and laboring on the new york review of books on his sickbed galley proofs were fanned out across the coverlet photographs spilled from manila folders “i do think it’s important to get the reporters’ raised hands inside the frame” and a large black multiline telephone lay humming and blinking beneath his right hand even as his illness began to sap the legendary energy that had propelled him well into his ninth decade through fifteenhour workdays and a social calendar that his young assistants would have found daunting bob would lift the receiver when the office called and declaim his favorite greeting “hello hello hello” annie schlechterrobert b silvers in his office at the new york review of books july  photograph by annie schlechter the enthusiasm bonhomie and openness to possibility in that triple salutation were characteristic of bob and defined his approach to editing “the paper” despite his immense erudition and considerable worldliness he was never jaded he was avid to be stimulated and educated by his writers who would have argued that he already knew everything and his mission as he saw it was to provide them with whatever resources they needed editorial or material—from plane tickets to saigon to boxed dvd sets of friday night lights—to produce the work that as he liked to say in the handwritten notes and rapidfire emails that started to accumulate as a deadline neared he was “very eager to see” eager the adjectives that recur in an interview he gave in  as the review neared its fiftieth anniversary belong to the vocabulary of the born enthusiast “i admire great writers people with marvelous and beautiful minds and always hope they will do something special and revealing” if they did it was largely because of the qualities of mind that bob brought to his editing the liveliness and inexhaustible curiosity tempered by a vigorously authentic taste that was unswayed by fashion and grounded in intellectual and ethical rigor these traits not coincidentally were shared by his longtime companion grace countess of dudley who died on december  two days before bob’s eightyseventh birthday that his death should have followed hers so swiftly comes as little surprise to those who knew the couple nor can there be any doubt that bob would have wanted a tribute to him to include a mention of the woman he considered the review’s muse at once its ideal reader—intelligent openminded alert to beauty and skeptical of phony authority whether in politics or art—and his inspiration in life and work for over forty years as for the review it will of course go on as he knew it would “i can think of several people who would be marvelous editors” bob told his interviewer “i think they would put out a terrific paper but it would be different” that’s where things stand the long first chapter is closed
