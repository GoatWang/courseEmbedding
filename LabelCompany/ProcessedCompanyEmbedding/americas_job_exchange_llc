tracy cole  marketing manager “it’s time for a change” was the theme of this month’s webinar newly appointed president of america’s job exchange aje bill fanning was excited to present his very first webinar at the helm of aje bill wasted no time addressing the “elephant in the room” with the majority of our federal contractor customers… today’s compliance is broken and the only way to affect change is by identifying the frustrations today’s recruiters have with what’s become a “check the box” obligation and providing them with a solution that redefines their expectations of diversity recruitment and office of federal contractor compliance programs ofccp compliance the time to disrupt is now bill first discussed the current challenges most employers face regarding ofccp regulations there are numerous job posting and job distribution sites that make meeting required expectations a “set it and forget it” experience for federal contractors but while their compliance obligations may be met diversity candidate flow from these solutions is rarely adequate  this is because the “generic job push” a common tool in the recruitment space doesn’t target diversity candidates where they are online next bill explained aje’s diversity recruitment solution which leverages data to intelligently target the diversity community on the sites they engage with most  by posting and promoting jobs on relevant sites then shifting budget based on the most effective efforts aje can optimize the return on our customers’ investments aje has developed the aje diversity network as a solution to simplify the process and intelligently engage and deliver the right candidates…and the early results are jaw dropping is your organization experiencing the same frustrations interested in more details

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf
