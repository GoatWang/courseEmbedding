my all and am finally happy i woke up to greener pastures big regret in not having left sooner at the end of the day calvert is owned by a nonprofit insurance company halfway across the country and it makes up hardly any of their overall business they care nothing about the company yet control every decision made to the point it is impossible to acquire or retain true talent new management came in

fulltimeprosnone really other than calvert investments is located in downtown bethesda which is an awesome place to workconsim posting this because calvert is currently looking to hire a number of developer and technology positions my strongest suggestion is that you think twice before considering working in it for this company despite being in an industry reliant on technology there is no managerial support or respect for it at calvert there has been no technology leadership for four years and while it was hoped this would improve under the new management its actually gotten worse the new ceo fired much of the department and many of their best folks have resigned management of the group has been given to a person with no prior it experience and no understanding of technology or development methodology unless there is a renewed commitment by management i cant imagine this would be a fulfilling and pleasant environmenton the flip side if youre an investment professional calvert is a great place investment folks are highly favored and wellcompensatedadvice to managementplease see above investment innovation and leadership are needed to create an exciting and rewarding
