taketwo interactive ttwo viacheslav makarenko mediumterm horizon longterm horizon research analyst fund holdingsvyacheslav makarenkosummaryduring his year reign as chairman and later as ceo strauss zelnick made a great turnover play that made taketwo one of the biggest gaming publishers in the worldthe latest earnings result proves that the company has still a lot to offer to its shareholders and theres no reason to sell the stockgrowth of digital and retail revenues along with expansion into the mobile space are the main reasons why im bullish on the companystrauss zelnick is an executive with over  years of experience in corporate america in  his private equity group zelnick media along with other funds like sac capital now point tudor investments oppenheimer funds and others organized a corporate takeover of taketwo interactive nasdaqttwo and replaced most of its board members with its own people since that time shares of taketwo increased by  annually the company became the third biggest publicly traded gaming company after ea nasdaqea and activision blizzard nasdaqatvi and the recent popularity of its ips suggests that there are still a lot of opportunities for all investors who already own or want to own a stake in the company on tuesday taketwo announced its q and full fiscal  earnings results and going through the reports and reading footnotes i see a couple of ways how the company will continue to create value and reward its shareholders along the way looking at the numbers we could see that the digital revenue for taketwo continues to increase and in q was  million  yy and accounted for nearly the half of the total revenue  million unlike other publishers taketwo most of the times releases additional downloadable content for its games for free and makes a profit on it by selling virtual currency that gives money advantage to players that buy it and use it inside their gaming universes this strategy proved to be effective for the company as the digital revenue continues to grow and it helps the publisher to keep users engaged and interested in its products for a long period of time at the same time the company announced that its gta  game that was released back in  sold more than  million units to date the civilization franchise surpassed  million unit shipments the latest installment of mafia  shipped more than  million units since its launch in october and its basketball simulator nba k made a new record for the series and sold more than  million units despite the lack of new ips its current franchises are making great returns on investment for the publisher and this is another reason why im bullish on taketwo having those series in its portfolio will help the company to decrease the cost of marketing and spend more resources on rd and improving its financial stance and if we look at the balance sheet we will see that taketwo has enough cash and cash equivalents to cover its debt and the overall positive business performance could be considered as another reason why taketwo is an attractive investment source ft in addition to that in february taketwo purchased spanish mobile gaming developer social point for  million the acquisition will help the company to establish a stronger presence in the mobile space as activision blizzard did in  when it purchased king digital and unlock new players that could become a part of taketwos ecosystem and improve the companys overall position in this area the release of various gta games on google play and app store was the first step on the mobile front and with the backing of social point we should expect to see more activity from taketwo in this lucrative market conclusion as we can see during his year reign as chairman and later as ceo strauss zelnick made a great turnover play that made taketwo one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world with assets all across the globe the growth of digital revenues along with the positive tendency of increased sales for its current franchises and the expansion into mobile are going to improve the companys stance on the market and open new opportunities to profit from for current and new shareholders while the companys stock is currently at its alltime highs i see no reason for a major pullback or trendreversal in the long term and consider taketwo as a value play latest earnings call made me feel more confident about the future of the company as mr zelnick assured all that taketwo will continue to execute its current strategy of quality over quantity regarding its products and i see no reason to sell the stock at the moment disclosure i amwe are long ttwo i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no

zelnick’s taketwo software buys back carl icahn’s shares for  million –   strauss zelnick on wednesday taketwo interactive software announced it was buying back the chunk of shares in the company owned by carl icahn at a price of us per share ie the closing price the previous day taketwo is a publisher of interactive games including notably the wildly successful grand theft auto carl icahn has held a position in taketwo for a number of years and has had seats on the board since  he last increased his holding about a year ago when he bought an additional  of the stock to hold about  of the company at that time even so he has not been the largest holder with black rock investments passively owning about  strauss zelnick the company’s chairman and ceo currently holds about  of the stock his partner in zelnick media karl slatoff who is also coo of taketwo owns about  as part of the deal just announced the three carl icahn nominees on taketwo’s board of directors he had been permitted to hold associated with his shareholding are submitting their resignations and leaving the board accordingly his son brett icahn jim nelson and sung hwan cho have now resigned from the board of taketwo the total purchase price taketwo paid to buy back icahn’s  million shares will be approximately us million and will be funded from the company’s own cash and other liquid resources following completion of the purchase taketwo will have about  million shares left outstanding and with the shares settling back a little after the deal was announced to us per share the market capitalization as of the time of writing is over us billion the company’s chairman and ceo strauss zelnick was quick to put a positive spin on the repurchase and to counter any thought that icahn had simply grown weary of seeing either further major advances in the shares or alternatively a takeover announcement from anyone else … “this share repurchase reflects our confidence in the company’s outlook for record results in fiscal  and continued nongaap profitability every year for the foreseeable future ” “with our ample cash and strong expected cash flow we are able to pursue a variety of investment opportunities including repurchasing our company’s stock” he was also gracious in thanking his three departing directors saying as well … “ they leave taketwo better positioned than ever for continued success” while the latest grand theft auto was a smash hit when it launched in september the company’s shares are always impacted by its perception as a “big hits” type of business and so shareholders are always a little worried about the next one even as the latest one does very well carl icahn obviously isn’t an ardent gamer with long term belief in the business though after a four year holding period this still seems almost an eternity compared to some of his usual deal timeframes about taketwo interactive software headquartered in new york city taketwo interactive software is a leading

surpassing  million units the title continues to attract and delight new audiences especially the install base of playstation  and xbox one expands further in addition grand theft auto online again delivered yearoveryear bookings growth in the fourth quarter substantially exceeding our expectations and was the single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending rockstar games has driven sustained engagement through the ongoing release of a wide array of three additional content most recently the cunning stunts special vehicle circuit update followed by the land grab and tiny racers modes in total rockstar games released  significant updates during fiscal  coupled with a regular weekly schedule of new content offerings and as much more planned going forward its a remarkable achievement that recurrent consumer spending on grand theft auto online has grown every year since its release and reached record levels in fiscal  more than  years after its initial launch our

civilization wwe k and xcom  as announced yesterday rockstar games have decided to move the release of red dead redemption through the spring  red dead redemption  will be their first game created

release slate our ability to project significant profits with lineup that solely includes new frontline releases of our annual sports entertainment titles reflect the strength of our robust catalog

spending coupled with our emerging opportunities and competitive gaming mobile and geographic expansion our potential for growth over the long term is better than ever ill now turn the call over to lainie lainie goldstein thanks karl and good morning everyone today ill discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year  results and then review our financial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year  please note that additional details regarding our actual results and financial outlook are contained in our press release including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our gaap financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance as mentioned by strauss our fiscal fourth quarter provided a strong finish to another great year for taketwo sales of our offerings exceeded our expectations due primarily to the continued outperformance of grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online total bookings growing  to  million in the fourth quarter of this amount  was digitally delivered bookings which grew  to  million as we continued to benefit from growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as our industrys ongoing transition to fullgame downloads while the performance of our business exceeded our expectations as reflected in our strong bookings and cash flow growth this outperformance is not reflected in our gaap results for  reasons first our bookings outperformance is driven by titles that we have acquired inaudible and therefore our revenues and profits wont benefit from these bookings until future period and second because of the betterthanexpected performance of grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online we recorded higherthanforecasted internal royalties which are calculated using results that are adjusted to exclude the impact of deferrals and unlike certain other costs of goods sold are not deferred turning to some details from our fourth quarter income statement gaap net revenue grew by  to  million and cost of goods sold increased  to  million this growth was driven primarily by the recognition of previously deferred revenues and costs from mafia iii operating expenses increased by  to  million due primarily to higher stockbased compensation legal and it expense and gaap net income increased by  to  million or  per share for the full fiscal year we delivered bookings in cash provided by operating activities that substantially exceeded the original outlook we gave last year these results were driven primarily by the sustained outperformance of grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online coupled with betterthanexpected sales of nba k and record recurrent consumer spending total bookings grew  to  billion driven primarily by the launches of mafia iii and sid meiers civilization vi along with growth of bookings from nba k and grand theft auto online of this amount  were digitally delivered bookings which grew  to a new record of  million our betterthanexpected bookings converted into strong net cash provided by operating activities which grew  to  million we spent  million in capital expenditures and we acquired social point for  million in cash along with  million shares of taketwo common stock as of march  our cash and shortterm investments balance was  billion turning to some details from our fiscal  income statement gaap net revenue and cost of goods sold each grew  to  billion and  billion respectively due primarily to the launches of mafia iii and sid meiers civilization vi as well as the recognition of higher revenues and costs from the growth of nba k operating expenses increased by  to  million due primarily to marketing expenses for fiscal  release slate and red dead redemption  as well as expense professional fees and stockbased compensation expense partially offset by the absence of a business reorganization charge recorded in fiscal  and gaap net income increased to  million or  per share up from a net loss of  million or  per share as noted in our press release starting with our financial outlook and results for fiscal first quarter  we are replacing bookings with net sales as an operational metric the company is making this change in order to increase transparency and to be consistent with the operational metrics provided by our peers net sales is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold physically during the period unlike bookings net sales includes licensing fees merchandise ingame advertising strategy guides and publisher incentives now i will review the highlights of our fiscal  financial outlook further details are contained in our press release including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our gaap financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance starting with the fiscal first quarter we expect net sales to range from  million to  million the largest contributors are expected to be grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online nba k and wwe k we expect gaap net revenue to range from  million to  million and cost of goods sold to range from  million to  million operating expenses are expected to range from  million to  million at the midpoint this represents a  increase over last year driven by the acquisition of social point now we expect gaap net income to range from  million to  million or  to  per share turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year we expect net sales to range from  billion to  billion this is expected to be down from fiscal  due to fewer new releases and moderating sales from grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online partially offset by growth from our nba k and wwe k series as well as the acquisition of social point we expect digital to increase as percentage of net sales and to be down slightly on an absolute dollar basis a slight decline in digitally delivered net sales is expected to be driven by lower fullgame downloads due to a lighter release slate which is expected to be largely offset by midsingledigit growth in the recurrent consumer spending the largest contributors in net sales are expected to be nba k grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online and wwe k we expect the net sales breakdown from our labels to be roughly  k  rockstar games and  social point and we expect our geographic net sales split to be about  united states and  international we expect to generate approximately  million in net cash provided by operating activities and we plan to deploy approximately  million for capital expenditures we expect gaap net revenue to range from  billion to  billion and cost of goods sold to range from  million to  million gaap net revenue is expected to increase due to the recognition of previously deferred revenues from grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online as well as nba k gaap cost of goods sold is expected to decrease primarily due to lower software development costs and lower internal royalty total operating expenses are expected to range from  million to  million at the midpoint this represents a  increase over the prior year driven by the acquisition of social point and we expect net income to range from  million to  million or  to  per share in closing our ability to deliver consistently the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences balanced with a disciplined focus on operational excellence enabled to deliver growth in revenue earnings and cash flow in fiscal  fiscal  is poised to be another strong year for taketwo despite an unusually light release slate and fiscal  promises to be one of our best years yet with net sales and net cash provided by operating activities expected to exceed  billion and  million respectively over the long term our company is better positioned than ever to generate growth and margin expansion for our shareholder thank you now ill turn the call back to strauss strauss zelnick thanks karl and lainie on behalf of our entire management team id like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding year to our shareholders i want to express our appreciation for your continued support well now take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mike olson with piper jaffray mike olson i dont know what you can say around it but im sure there can be various reasons for a game to be delayed some good in the sense that you could be adding more content or other features or it could be that theres something mechanically wrong with the game can you provide any context around what category this delay would fall into and then secondly as you said recurrent consumer spend for gta online has grown every year since launch does the fiscal  revenue guidance including that gta online specifically grows or declines yearoveryear strauss zelnick mike its strauss i think the purpose of the delay for red dead redemption  is to make sure that we deliver the most extraordinary experience were capable of providing we havent gone into particular issues we are building a new game from the ground up for the first time for new generation consoles and the pressure that we put on ourselves to deliver excellence and to delight consumers is extraordinary and we want to make sure that the appropriate time is taken to do the very best job we can and i think thats what consumers expect of rockstar games and thats what rockstar games typically delivers so we support emphatically the labels decision and were utterly confident that itll prove that in time to be wise first and foremost creatively and artistically and economically as well and to your second question lainie will take that lainie goldstein our guidance assumes that gta online will moderate in a nonfiscal year  it did grow significantly in  and we continue to support it but since its unlike anything else that weve ever had and we have very little visibility into how long it will continue this trend of growth weve included it as moderating in this years guidance operator our next question is coming from the line of tim oshea with jeffrey tim oshea i just have  one for strauss and one for lainie so strauss i was just hoping you could share how anticipation is building ahead of the big red dead launch and maybe what kind of signals are your tracking from the community that might help give us confidence around how big of a launch this might be and then just for lainie obviously youre shifting red dead into fiscal  but as you think about outlook im just curious if there are any costs embedded in that fiscal  outlook around red dead maybe for marketing or something like that strauss zelnick yes tim i appreciate it its not really my nature or our nature to claim victory before it occurs more a nature to do the very best we can to delight consumers and then report the results to say that were highly confident about red dead redemption  is an extraordinary understatement but im not sure that really matters in the fullness of time the title will be released and consumers get to vote there is no doubt that the engagement with the materials that we released was extraordinary the screenshots are beautiful the buzz is palpable and growing but beyond that rockstar games will talk about how the title is progressing and how consumers are responding in the fullness of time so it does fall into the category of how high is up it is a highly anticipated title thats an understatement but its our style to say look we do the very best we can and the results will speak for themselves lainie goldstein and we are including marketing for red dead redemption  in our fiscal year  guidance since its a spring release we will certainly see some marketing for the title during the fiscal year operator our next question is from the line of drew crum with stifel drew crum so i want to go back to gta online talk about what rockstars plans are for content fiscal  if theres any change there given the timing of red dead  and then separately on social point can you remind us what the earnouts are for calendar  and  whats embedded in guidance and it looks like theres no new games planned for social point but you follow the same protocol rely on them to make the game announcements and then expound upon those with earnings calls strauss zelnick drew its strauss on gta online we have said that plenty more content is coming more announcements will be made by rockstar games the title is absolutely being supported by the label consumers love it it remains an enormous focus of everyones attention we remain very excited about it even though our financial results are expected to moderate in terms of red dead redemption  coming thats unrelated to the gta online as ive said many times before all entertainment from all enterprises competes with everyone and competes with no one entertainment stands on its own no one ever needs another entertainment property when theres nothing in the marketplace that excites us we stay home when theres plenty in the marketplace that excites us we buy as much as we can afford so i dont believe theres any connection between grand theft auto online and red dead redemption  and certainly here at our enterprise were full steam ahead supporting all of our successful properties and always trying to make more as we go along karl slatoff and just to address your question about the earnout so the sellers are eligible to receive an earnout its public you can look it out yourself its basically  times every dollar of ebitda earned by social point in excess of  million in  and  million in  and that amount is capped at  million thats how the earnout works and whats your other question about social point i missed that one drew crum so you havent  it looks like youve not announced any new games as part of fiscal  is it possible some slip in this year or should we not assume anything for fiscal  karl slatoff what we have said is that social point has got a pipeline of games that are coming out over the next couple of years wed not announced timing about when those games are there are games in various stages of development and testing its a little bit of a different process than we thought with our other  labels just given the nature of the games themselves its more of an iterative development and release strategy but rest assured there are games in the pipeline over the next couple of years drew crum okay and karl just to go back to the first part of the question the  million and  million respectively of ebitda are you assuming that social point hit those thresholds as part of your guidance strauss zelnick were not commenting on where it fits operator our next question is from the line of eric handler with mkm partners eric handler when you look at your fullgame digital downloads where are you right now as you end fiscal  like what percentage of your games are getting the fullgame download versus what you are implying with your guidance for fiscal   fiscal  and how you think that trend is progressing secondly with regard to your statement about fiscal  the last time you guys generated  million of operating cash flow was the launch year for gta  and you did  that year im just curious is that sort of like a good baseline to think about for eps in fiscal  strauss zelnick thanks eric and really appreciate the inaudible on fullgame downloads digital distribution is responsible for roughly  of our console sales and about  of our pc sales for frontline for catalog its obviously greater we expect that in our numbers to be roughly the same going forward strategically however over time we think digital distribution grows as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal  were not commenting on eps i think weve given a good deal of visibility already operator next question comes from the line of justin post of merrill lynch justin post two questions first does the delay of red dead impact any of other rockstars other projects and then secondly could you help us frame the opportunity for nba esports relative to the current revenues that the franchise is generating like how would you think about the incremental revenue opportunity strauss zelnick the decision to move the release of red dead redemption  will have no impact on any of rockstar games other activities with regard to our esports venture about which were  we just couldnt be more excited actually just met yesterday with brandan and with the commissioner in for our standard catchup meetings and were just thrilled with the progress that the venture is making and therell be more said about that in the future however were not including that progress in our outlook and thats not because were not optimistic we are its just too early to size it we know that if we get this right theres an amazing opportunity for the fans and therefore an amazing economic opportunity thats always how we look at the world however we have not included it in our outlook justin post any way of framing it like three or five years out like how you think about it strauss zelnick its so tempting to share my views but it sort of falls in the category of  im an optimist couple of the folks sitting on the table with me here are pessimists but it doesnt matter and weve proven in the  years that we managed this business that our opinions are irrelevant we show up every day as do  of our colleagues we work super hard to be the most creative efficient and innovative organization in the entertainment business sometimes we get it wrong and we take responsibility more often than not we get it right and we see the results thats what were trying to do here im really confident that we will get it right and if we do i think the economic results for both the venture and for our game related to the venture will be nothing short of astonishing but thats just what i think and frankly i wouldnt put a whole lot of stock in that were moving in that direction and certainly our goal and its our collective goal and look were the first professional sport to launch a competitive gaming league and the excitement among the fans among the teams at the nba and here at k and taketwo is palpable its our job now to hunker down and turn that into reality and the money will follow operator our next question is from the line of san phan with mizuho san phan can you tell us how much of the growth in nba k unit sales is coming from the us versus international and then the second question is something more broad does the ongoing success youre seeing in recurrent digital spend change your view in strategy with frontline title releases in any way strauss zelnick so we dont break out international or domestic sales for nba however international growth has been a big benefit for us we are focused on it we focus more on localization we have local commentators as the sport grows overseas so does our game and theres an anonymous amount of ongoing opportunity in terms of recurrent consumer spending yes we have said that as we look at future releases all of them are built with an eye towards ongoing engagement so this business used to be a business where we did our best to create this extraordinary experience the experience was finished we launched it into the market the consumer voted we went on to the next and we had a catalog and because the technology was constantly changing to encapsulate the limited value all of that has now changed in reverse order catalog now has much more value we have the highestselling catalog per sku frankly because we have the highest metacritic scores and our quality holds up over time people want to play our games many many years after the release and equally we now can look at a hit game and say when you have a hit title people want to stay engaged so we have to plan ahead and say are we going to have meaningful ongoing opportunities to engage each game is different so we  each game looks at those meaningful opportunities through a different lens it could be the lens of a multiplayer version online it would have for example virtual currency sales it could be a freetoplay title launched by social point which has ingame purchases it could be nba k online in china which ingame purchases it could be wwe supercard which has ingame purchases it could be downloadable addon content for which one pays it could be free addon content anything that delights consumers and keeps them engaged with our titles and our brands is good for them and therefore good for us and we find that the monetization follows were definitely getting better at the data surrounding this were getting better at translating engagement into monetization but at the risk of being repetitive at this company first and foremost we focus on the consumer and the monetization follows san phan so given that your catalog sales are growing youre getting more existing engagement in existing growing engagement in existing titles could we see possibly maybe releasing bigger titles further apart than we would have in years past strauss zelnick we stated a strategy not to annualize any titles apart from sports entertainment titles  years ago and the market has moved in our direction has become more complex to deliver big titles and more difficult and more timeconsuming to create aplus quality which is what the market demands our cadence isnt expected to change and in certain instances we hope that the time in between releases will actually decrease i dont expect that the time length between releases will increase operator next question comes from the line of ray stochel with consumer edge research ray stochel i guess this is going off of the last subject but do you have any update on the digital strategy for red dead redemption  strauss zelnick weve said that there will be an online component and well leave the rest of that discussion to rockstar games ray stochel got it and then quick bigger picture follow up how are you thinking now about your pc distribution strategy as you grow and increasingly become more relevant in the market what are the pros and cons of owning your own platform strauss zelnick we do have our own platform consumers can buy directly from our store and thats  its a small part of our business in general its our view that consumers want to go to a place where they can buy a multiplicity of titles and the notion of only being able to buy one companys title isnt really the way entertainment is typically consumed were quite happy to share with our distribution partners its the nature of the entertainment business and our strategy as opposed to trying to grab all the margin and distribute directly is try to be a really great and trusted partner of an every possible storefront on earth weve always taken the view that we want to be wherever the consumer is and the economics of our physical business include sharing the economics of our digital business include sharing wed love of course to increase the percentage that we keep who wouldnt but the most important thing economically speaking are the dollars that we generate and we believe that the widest possible distribution is the way to do that so we know a couple of our competitors have tried really hard to focus entirely on direct distribution certainly there are elements of the freetoplay mobile business that can look a lot like that but their sharing  theres always someone you have to share with there so again we focus less on what percent we have to share in order to get distribution and more on the dollars that we generate and the availability and ubiquity of our products operator the next question is from the line of ben schachter with macquarie ben schachter i have a few quick modeling questions for lainie and then one for stauss lainie can you help us with the change in deferred revenues for fy  and also whats the tax rate we should be using for  and  and then also in the initial guide for fy  whats the relative size of red dead versus the k game discussed in the press release and then strauss can you discuss rockstars capacity to work on more than  franchises at one time we obviously know theyre working on red dead and continuing on gta do they have enough resources to be working on other titles at the same time lainie goldstein so for  on the change in deferred revenue for  we havent given out any additional details on  other than what we expect in terms of net sales and the cash from operations and so our tax rate for  were using  for our management reportings and for  again were not giving any additional information than what weve given already strauss zelnick and in terms ben of rockstars capacity yes rockstar and k both have the capacity to work on a multiplicity of projects theres attention of course in that as weve shown an ability and a willingness to hire plenty of creative talent the growth in our headcount over the past  years has largely been creative headcount there is attention in finding the best talent in the business weve made no bones about that its true for our competitors who are only looking for the best and the brightest that said both k and rockstar have the ability to work on a multiplicity of projects simultaneously and the question for both of them is how do you direct your resources on the one hand to supporting something thats working mightily now and on the other hand to something that will we hope work mightily in the future and thats a decision that is a challenging and complex one that one makes with limited information at every entertainment enterprise but resources are our issue and ambition isnt our issue probably and to the extent we have a problem its a high class problem we have  extraordinary franchises that have each sold over  million units in an individual release we have something like  that have sold at least  million in individual release thats pretty different state of play than just a few years ago with this enterprise we think we have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business and basically our business is exploding in every area whether thats sports entertainment whether thats freetoplay whether thats mobile whether thats gta online whether thats a sale of gta  itself nearing  million units and the list goes on so the question for us is always how do we reach a new height and thats what were focused on at k thats what were focused on at rockstar and certainly thats what were focused on at social point and finally at taketwo ben schachter stauss if i can just sneak one more in can you remind us how you think about excess cash in terms of onetime dividend buyback just in general your philosophy on what you do with excess cash strauss zelnick i guess it is a natural question when we talked about what fiscal  looks like generating about  million of cash flow from operations in fiscal  where the initial outlook sitting here today is  million of cash flow from operations so its a fair question since we just reported  billion in cash and we just spent  billion on an acquisition a few months ago i would observe these are highclass problems we said over time that there are  areas in which to deploy capital the first is to support organic growth this company story has largely been an organic growth story and we now have the ability to take measured risk when we believe theres a great opportunity for return and thats has really worked out very well for us second weve said we are now in a position seriously to consider accretive inorganic opportunities and were acting accordingly with the acquisition of social point and i think our view is many more opportunities will present themselves whats our lens were highly disciplined strategically were highly disciplined economically weve said we would do deals when theyre accretive social point is immediately accretive to the cash flow from operations and soon will be accretive to actually revenues and earnings and we look through that lens were not interested in pie in the sky were not interested in talking about strategy and overpaying for something were certainly not interested in buying a money losing enterprise finally weve shown a willingness to return capital to our shareholders well do buybacks when we can execute them at deep value in our view and in any scholarly view of merit thats the only time it ever makes sense for an organization to do a buyback weve done two both at deep value and with hindsight of course we didnt have hindsight when we made the decision and we will contemplate other forms of returning cash to the shareholders right now we still have a convertible bond that we have to take care of that will clean up our balance sheet and leave us entirely debtfree and so these are issues that we will continue to contemplate going forward but thats how we look at the world specifically just for transparency hard for me to believe that a onetime dividend will make sense operator our next question is from the line of stephen ju of crédit suisse chrishum chris hum for steven curious about the launch window for red dead is there something about this game that you feel would make it better for a summer launch versus launching in the winter and kind of how your expectations have changed since we last talked strauss zelnick yes for a title like this i dont think the launch window really matters and obviously red dead redemption went out in may and was an extraordinarily successful title consumers are consuming entertainment year round now they dont stop in the summer months and we believe that if you give people an extraordinary experience they will show up for it operator i will now turn the floor back to management for closing remarks strauss zelnick we just want to thank everyone for joining us today obviously weve a lot going on here really pleased to report the results that are meaningfully ahead of our initial expectations were looking forward to a fiscal year that despite a rather light frontline release schedule looks incredibly sound economically and naturally were all super excited about our upcoming release schedule and what that will bring in fiscal  and in the years beyond thank you so much for joining us today operator this concludes todays conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation copyright
