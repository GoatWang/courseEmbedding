with us to help answer your questions at the end of todays call are toby rice president and chief operating officer derek rice executive vice president of exploration and rob wingo senior vice president of midstream and marketing to briefly recap this mornings announcements rice reported strong third quarter results we increased  production guidance achieved a  million borrowing base increase and successfully completed the dropdown of our water services business to rice midstream partners for  million similarly rice midstream partners reported solid third quarter results and announced the pricing of a  million private placement of rmp common units in addition rmp increased  guidance to reflect the water acquisition and higher gathering throughput ebitda and dcf coverage rmp will host a conference call to discuss these results in more detail at  am eastern today before gray and i cover our third quarter financial and operational results i want to briefly speak to our positioning in this challenging commodity price environment one thats expected to persist into  this market has certainly rendered many appalachian areas uneconomic and has forced most producers to shift development to other areas or in the case of producers who have no economic acreage at current prices suspend their development altogether as a result there has been a noticeable shift in producer activity away from liquidsrich and noncore dry gas marcellus and utica areas and into the marcellus and uticas dry gas cores our company is unique because we havent needed to change our focus were investing in the same areas today as we were when gas prices were much higher and i think we may be the only company in appalachia whose strategy and focus has remained the same during this price cycle this distinction is important to note because even though were in the same commodity price environment as everyone else each company came into this commodity price environment prepared differently we think we came in more prepared than most and our preparation is unique and advantaged in several key ways first  of our current and planned investments generate healthy returns of  to  at strip pricing second we have one of the strongest hedged positions through  third our firm transportation portfolio has been properly sized to meet but never exceed our production growth and lastly weve built and we control a bestinclass midstream business in the dry gas cores of the marcellus and utica with a growing list of customers that value our service and quality of our assets our assets make economic sense in good markets and bad and this fact shapes our sentiment towards two topics ma and the emerging super deep dry gas utica play in pennsylvania with ma weve always considered ourselves an opportunistic company that can move swiftly and aggressively if the right acquisition comes along that makes strategic and economic sense even though  of our acreage is in areas where producers want to be and weve maintained a pretty deep inventory of drilling locations across these areas were always looking for ways to create more value for our shareholders and therefore were always evaluating opportunities in appalachia which we happen to be seeing a lot more of in this market but none that weve seen todate are more strategic or economic than focusing our efforts on the development of our existing asset base well continue to monitor opportunities as we feel we are uniquely positioned to capitalize when the right opportunity comes along but we havent just seen it yet an interesting development that were monitoring though is the pennsylvania utica as we mentioned a few months ago our pilot hole data from our initial pennsylvania utica well the john briggs u revealed the rock quality in southwest pennsylvania was nearly identical to the worldclass utica were seeing in belmont county ohio the only discernible difference between the two is the more favorable pressures and depths in pennsylvania which is approximately  feet deeper its worth mentioning that although this is our first utica well in pennsylvania its not our first time dealing with this reservoir we view this well as a natural extension of our ohio operations and not a completely new play for us in order to leverage our knowledge about this reservoir from belmont county we designed this greene county well to have the same parameters as our bigfoot h well in belmont county including drilling and completion designs as well as our plan to flow this under a restricted rate this allows us to expedite our assessment of this well and draw definitive conclusions sooner because of similar rock qualities to what weve observed in ohio we expected our first pa utica well would demonstrate a similar decline profile as our ohio utica wells but starting with a higher flowing casing pressure slide three in this mornings presentation shows this wells performance based on casing pressure versus cumulative production per  foot of lateral compared to bigfoot h and another peers utica well east of us in greene county pennsylvania our  foot lateral took a bit longer to clean up during the initial flowback period which we think contributed to the steeper drop in casing pressure early on but our primary focus has been the decline profile once the well has reached a stabilized flow rate after  days of cleanup weve stabilized the flow rate at  million cubic feet per day with decline profiles exactly in line with what weve observed from adjacent greene county wells and our belmont county utica wells based on our current production and pressure information we expect this well to produce flat at  million cubic feet per day for approximately  days this well is shaping up to be the strongest well rice has ever drilled and were highly encouraged for what this resource could mean for rice and our midstream business and its worth talking through our initial game plan for the pennsylvania utica our first step was determining whether or not the resource was there the john briggs u answered that one with a resounding yes the second step is determining how to increase these wells economics in order to compete with our capital thats currently being allocated entirely to our deep inventory of highreturning marcellus and ohio utica locations based on this wells performance we think theres more room for improvement on costs than from production and so higher single well returns will need to come from driving down well costs getting up the learning curve with  million to  million wells is an expensive proposition and we think pennsylvania utica has the potential to eventually compete with our marcellus and ohio utica returns but this isnt the right market to really begin its development our upstream and midstream teams however are poised to take advantage of this emerging opportunity the best part is we dont really need to do much to position ourselves for its success we already have a sizeable acreage position in the core of the pennsylvania utica of which a decent amount is held by our marcellus production and we control a midstream business thats built a gathering system that was intentionally oversized to handle any volumes we push their way were excited about this play we have the right pieces to make it a success and well begin developing when that time is right but for  well stick with the development of our lowrisk highreturn marcellus and ohio utica wells our teams will continue to evaluate john briggs u and offset peers  wells in preparation for our return to pa utica in terms of near to mediumterm supply since these are marcellus players diverting capital away from marcellus development pa utica production growth really just replaces what wouldve otherwise been marcellus production growth and therefore we do not believe that this is an additive source of supply to the basin turning over to our operations for the third quarter operationally we had a great third quarter bringing wells online ahead of schedule at or below budget our third quarter net production averaged  million cubic feet per day which was a  increase from second quarter  and  increase relative to third quarter  as we noted in our earnings release  bcf of this net production was a working interest adjustment of which a portion was from a prior quarter to explain a nonoperated working interest owner in our digger wells in ohio couldnt pay their working interest share of well costs and they agreed to trade their acreage in these units for nonstrategic undeveloped utica acreage of ours and to be clear the partner in question wasnt gulfport who continues to show strong conviction to its operations in belmont county in terms of real production during the quarter we came in slightly ahead of expectations due to a few operated marcellus wells and gulfport nonoperated utica wells being turned to sale sooner than anticipated we updated our  production guidance range to  million cubic feet equivalent per day to  million cubic feet equivalent per day to reflect these updates in the marcellus during the third quarter we turned  wells to sales with an average lateral length of  feet and these wells are currently producing approximately  million cubic feet per day our average costs for these wells was approximately  per lateral foot achieving our yearend goal of  per foot in late october we turned online two net wells in washington county one marcellus and one upper devonian well with average lateral lengths of approximately  feet these wells were designed as pilot test wells to better understand the interaction between the marcellus and upper devonian reservoirs for the year we expect to turn to sales  net marcellus wells which is reflected in our updated guidance slide on page seven of our third quarter slide deck we continue to be proud of our teams continued hard work this year staying ahead of schedule and reducing oil costs as we start sharpening our pencils around  spending and production we expect to exit  with  marcellus wells in development that will contribute to our  growth shifting to the ohio utica we did a great job in the first half of the year getting all of our planned  wells to sales when gas prices were better than they are today and our drilling activity in the second half of  sets the table for production growth in  thats economically advantaged by virtue of our hedge and ft positions through september  we have turned to sales  gross  net operated utica wells our first utica well bigfoot h has been online since june  and todate has cumulatively produced over  bcf casing pressure is approaching line pressure and the flow rate should begin declining soon by the time of our next earnings call we will be able to provide some early time data on the wells production decline its amazing to think weve been developing the utica since  and have yet to see any declines from any of our  producing utica wells i think this really speaks to the quality and consistency of the rock and our execution slide  in our presentation includes updated production information as of september  for our  producing operated utica wells last quarter we shared with you our managed choke test we were conducting on our gold digger and sonuvadigger wells to determine flow rates to optimize longterm production as highlighted in these charts we choked back the flow rates on our digger wells by approximately  and in doing so observed a noticeable improvement in pressure declines from each pad we have another  days of production data from these wells now at these flow rates and can draw some more definitive conclusions the first conclusion is choking these wells back results in a longer flat period which should really come as no surprise but what were seeing is were actually able to produce more during this flat period than we would have produced had we flowed these wells at a higher rate we havent yet quantified the impact to eurs but generally speaking more flat period production should lead to higher eurs now that weve fully transitioned to pad drilling mode were able to highlight our teams technical proficiency and capital efficiency in what is emerging as the dry gas core of the utica shale drilling times have come down relative to  and in  were averaging  days to drill a well compared to  days in  we expect to exit  with  operated wells in various stages of development and will finish completing these wells by the middle of  similar to the marcellus were able to achieve impressive production growth protected by our advantaged hedge position and access to good markets supported by our ft contracts on pipelines such as tetco and rockies express shifting to takeaway in midstream were very content with our firm transportation portfolio and we think weve done a good job selecting our markets and balancing exposure to appalachian pricing we see  bcf to  bcf a day of incremental takeaway capacity coming online through  concurrent with producers slowing their development our analysis suggests that longhaul pipeline capacity will eventually surpass inbasin production which should result in appalachian basis  improving faster than expected during the next  months as a result our expected production growth in excess of our firm transportation will greatly benefit from this anticipated recovery in pricing shifting to our midstream operations total throughput for the third quarter for our pennsylvania and ohio gathering systems increased over  above second quarter  to approximately  dekatherms per day third quarter throughput consisted of  thirdparty volumes primarily from two of our customers eqt in pennsylvania and gulfport energy in ohio rmps third quarter throughput was  dekatherms per day while our ohio gathering system gathered  dekatherms per day our ohio gathering buildout is ahead of schedule as we completed our main trunkline last quarter providing total throughput capacity of  million dekatherms per day that will access tetco rex dominion east ohio and et rover in order to deliver our gas to the gulf coast and midwest markets our pennsylvania and ohio water systems are fully operational providing fresh water from the monongahela river the ohio river and other regional water sources to rice and other thirdparty producers for completions our water systems provide meaningful operational and economic benefits by improving the completions process and reducing the need for more expensive water trucking services as we announced this morning were pleased to announce that we have successfully completed our first dropdown transaction with rmp as they acquired our water services business this transaction represents the first of several potential monetization events that we believe will illuminate the value of our extensive and growing midstream systems through this accretive dropdown to rmp were able to continue funding midstream development without impacting ep liquidity including funding our recentlyannounced planned midstream joint venture with gulfport in ohio taking a closer look at the dropdown transaction rmp acquired rices water services business for  million which includes our pennsylvania and ohio freshwater distribution systems and related facilities as well as the right to provide fresh water for well completions and handle flowback and produce water the terms of the agreement include a onetime  million earnout payment by rmp less any associated capex once rice adds  million gallons per day of water sources in ohio by the end of  in early october we also announced that rice entered into a letter of intent with gulfport energy to form a midstream joint venture to provide gas gathering compression and water services to  acres of gulfports eastern belmont and monroe acreage in ohio including acreage recently acquired from paloma and american energy – utica the gas gathering system will have  million dekatherms a day of design capacity and consist of approximately  miles of high and low pressure gathering pipelines with multiple interconnects including rockies express et rover tetco and dominion east ohio in addition the jv will construct a freshwater distribution system to deliver fresh water to gulfports pads for well completion operations over the next six years rice and gulfport plan to collectively invest  million in gathering and compression assets as well as an addition  million in water assets with each partner funding their respective share rice has already commenced construction of certain portions of the system and expects to begin flowing volumes by middle of  with more significant volumes by yearend  through this jv we will expand our relationship with gulfport across their core position in the ohio utica shale and we believe this business will be one of the largest dry gas gathering systems in the prolific dry gas core of the utica this business adds to our attractive inventory of dropdown candidates further diversifies our midstream customer base and highlights the quality of our midstream service and ability to leverage our existing assets to obtain additional thirdparty business ill now turn the call over to gray to discuss our financial results grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks danny during the quarter our net production averaged  million cubic feet per day which was a  increase over third quarter  and a  increase above second quarter  as described in the news release  million a day of our third quarter production was related to buying out the working interest in a few of our ohio utica wells from one of our nonoperative partners for approximately  million we brought online a total of  net wells during the quarter net production exceeded our third quarter guidance also as a result of bringing online an additional eight net wells that were originally planned for the fourth quarter approximately  of our third quarter production was marcellus and  utica our prehedged realized price was  per mcf which includes our basis differential of negative  ft fuel and variable expense of  per mcf and btu uplift of  per mcf including the impact of our hedges our adjusted postrealized hedge price was  we generated approximately  million in ebitdax on a consolidated basis and adjusted net income of roughly  million or  per diluted share during the third quarter we incurred approximately  million of dc capex  million of organic leasehold and  million of midstream capex excluding rmp this morning we provided updated  capex reflecting slightly reduced spend in the marcellus and a  million increase in our utica program attributable to the positive working interest adjustments and accelerated gulfport operated activity and faster cycle times in our drilling program for our retained midstream capex budget we are increasing it from  million to  million to reflect our new gulfport midstream joint venture and updated ohio gathering project activity and costs these costs are expected to be fully funded by our available borrowings under our retained midstream credit facility and midstream cash flows turning to some recent events effective october   the borrowing base under our upstream credit facility was increased by  million to  million dollars representing a  increase yesterday rice midstream holdings received  million from rmp as consideration for our water service business acquisition looking at our september   balance sheet and liquidity pro formad for the water transaction and private placement we exited the quarter at  times third quarter net debt to run rate ebitda on a fully consolidated basis and  times on an ep basis our liquidity position was  billion consisting of  million of ep liquidity and about  million of retainments from liquidity our ft portfolio and active hedge program continues to support our cash flows and protect our strong returns in the third quarter  of our production received favorable gulf coast tco and midwest pricing which translated to a basis differential of  compared to a wider local basis of around  for the quarter for the fourth quarter of  we expect to deliver approximately  of our gas to more favorable markets outside of appalachia as a result of an additional  dekatherms per day of ft projects coming online in late third quarter we have  of our fourth quarter production hedged at a weighted average floor of  per mmbtu based on the midpoint of our updated guidance we have a very strong  hedge position and now have approximately  dekatherms per day hedged at a weighted average floor price of  per mmbtu in terms of guidance we increased our full year  production guidance to  mmcf to  mmcf per day and expect to bring online  net wells for the year we expect to come in at the higher end of our production guidance also we increased our ep ga expense and lowered our loe expense guidance for the year for the fourth quarter we expect net production to average  million cubic feet per day to  million cubic feet per day this is an  decrease from our adjusted third quarter production of approximately  million cubic feet per day excluding the outofperiod working interest adjustments looking ahead to  from a budget perspective we are still evaluating our plans for next year and well release formal guidance in february our dc investments are predicated on two primary factors creating economic returns and maintaining an appropriate balance sheet and were confident that well be able to do that with the plan that we lay out based on the way the market looks today our planned dc investments in  have a  to  irr at current strip prices and will drive cash flow in  through  on the balance sheet side we will continue to target  times ep leverage and have various ways to manage this metric our robust hedging position in  will mute a majority of our ebitdax at  gas prices and for us the two biggest levers to manage our debt will be our upstream capex and midstream monetizations our midstream value continues to grow and we have a significant amount of retained midstream value in the core of the utica along with untapped gp value to summarize rices financial and strategic goals are to create shareholder value with a focus on returns and downside protection this is the same consistent goal weve had since ipo our returnscentric strategy is  focused on core acreage and consistent well execution that predictably and profitably grows our business throughout the commodity cycles this focus on returns results in cash flow growth balance sheet improvement and the byproduct not the driver is sustained longer term production growth to protect our economics were very well hedged and we have a measured firm transportation portfolio that covers the vast majority of volumes but not in excess of them on the balance sheet side we are well positioned with current leverage of  times daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director thanks gray with that wed like to open up the lines for qa questionandanswer session operator our first question is from neal dingmann at suntrust neal d dingmann  suntrust robinson humphrey inc morning guys danny i know you dont have official plans out yet for  but i guess just sort of two questions around that versus the kind of ish type of wells youre going to spud this year thoughts given the efficiencies that youve had im just wondering any type of numbers you might have for next year and then secondly as far as areas that you might focus you mentioned obviously looking at the utica in pa your thoughts about potentially drilling such as up in washington grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president on the wells spud will be in the general ballpark of what we did this year on the second question ill turn it over to danny daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yeah i mean i think were becoming somewhat agnostic to whether were drilling pennsylvania marcellus or ohio utica wells the returns there are becoming a lot more comparable now and so its really just going to be dictated by the rig schedule that we run in each area in terms of pennsylvania utica and drilling more wells there i think were super content just sitting back and just watching the production data from this first well i think kind of the nice thing that we have going for us is were going to have peers that are going to do a lot of the derisking all around our position in washington and greenes so theres really nothing thats compelling us to want to go out there and derisk this area for ourselves when we know that theres going to be other folks around us doing it for us neal d dingmann  suntrust robinson humphrey inc sure that makes sense and then just secondly for either you or gray just wondered how you think about next year given sort of the leverage you have now and kind of what youre looking at potential outspend how do you think about your plan depending on different natural gas price sensitivities out there again you obviously have the dropdown opportunities like we saw today so how does that factor in on either a leverage ratio youre comfortable with running or a cash flow outspend type of sensitivity youre ready to do grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah neal we really focus on leverage first and foremost and right now were well positioned well below  times and our target as it has been since ipo is to make sure were targeting around  times and are confident well put out a budget next year that does that obviously we dont put out a budget until february to take into the second part of your question of what gas prices ultimately turn out to be but were very well hedged for next year so like we said were i think protected from some of that risk neal d dingmann  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it thank you all grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks neal operator our next question comes from holly stewart at scotia howard weil holly barrett stewart  scotia capital usa inc good morning guys julie first i guess on the midstream side you mentioned the release at the ohio system is ahead of schedule any update on timing of that and then how does that impact your thoughts just around the timing of the drop robert r wingo  senior vice presidentmidstream  marketing sure hey holly this is rob wingo so the trunklines in ohio are all constructed both the water and the gas so at this point really all were going to have are the two mile or less pad connects grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president on the drop side were still targeting back half of next year obviously it will depend on market conditions and a lot of other things but thats still the general target holly barrett stewart  scotia capital usa inc okay and then i guess my followup would be on the jv with gulfport youve given the capex range for the next six years can you provide any color just on how that sort of falls certainly in the earlier years grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah were still again finalizing that budget for next year as well but it will definitely be much more frontloaded especially the first two years so  and  so thats definitely our expectations final numbers were still working on holly barrett stewart  scotia capital usa inc okay great thank you robert r wingo  senior vice presidentmidstream  marketing the only thing i would add is maybe a third of that gets spent next year that could go up or down based on timing but assume a third of that  million gets spent next year holly barrett stewart  scotia capital usa inc thats good thank you rob operator the next question comes from leo mariani at rbc leo mariani  rbc capital markets llc hey guys i was hoping you could kind of walk us through the moving pieces on the lower fourth quarter  production here is that just largely driven by a lack of completions and maybe you could also kind of speak to operated versus nonoperated expectations grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president yep so just the way the year shaped up we had about a little over  of our net wells come online in q and q so that obviously resulted in some higher q production and a little bit lower q production on the net wells online it will pretty much all be marcellus and dont have much utica either operated or nonoperated coming online in the fourth quarter leo mariani  rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and i guess looking at your first pennsylvania utica well i guess you guys sound like youre flowing at  million cubic feet a day you guys are flowing some of the ohio wells at  million a day are you just limited by gathering infrastructure i just wanted to get a sense of why their rate is a bit different there daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yeah this is danny i mean we typically flow our wells based on a rate per  foot of lateral obviously the utica wells were drilling in ohio a lot of them are  feet  feet up to  feet and so were flowing those on a rate per  foot of lateral this well our first well in pennsylvania utica was only a  foot lateral and so were still flowing it at essentially  million per  foot of lateral which is the same rate that we flowed bigfoot h at so its in line with the other wells on a per lateral foot basis and were super encouraged by what the decline profile looks like at that rate leo mariani  rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful can you guys talk to hbp issues over the next couple of years as well in terms of what you need to do to manage leasehold daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yeah i think when we look at just laying out our development plan and just looking at the quality of the rock both in the marcellus and the utica i think one of the really unique things that we have is because we have such a concentrated acreage position theres not much just geologic difference across our position and so for us we have to pick one variable to base our development program around and so the most least arbitrary way to do it was okay well lets prioritize our development based on hbp schedule not that we have nearterm leasehold expirations but you have to prioritize your development around something and so that was the metric that we picked our development program around so were developing around our hbp but were still a couple years out before we really start to see any type of leasehold expirations so its kind of a nonissue for us so were kind of in a good position right now leo mariani  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yep operator the next question is from tim rezvan at sterne agee timothy a rezvan  sterne agee crt hi good morning folks had a question on the dropdown of the water services business i know you all stated you think the midstream assets are not reflected in the share price possibly from an nav perspective but looking at traditional ev ebitda multiples sale multiple is well below where your shares trade whether youre looking at  or  estimates so i guess the question is how do you define this as accretive and what made you decide that this was the right decision right now grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president yep first of all every drop is different on this particular drop i think one thing to think back to is when the water ebitda was created about a year ago this was previously a capitalized item in conjunction with our wells so  was the first year that we had water ebitda so if you think back just on a more holistic and historical basis we do think it was very accretive because we were taking a capitalized item and creating ebitda with it that subsequently got dropped for  million so i understand where youre coming at if it had always been a part of our cost structure and our ebitda profile but it wasnt a year ago and then it was for  and then we dropped it so when we think about it in that context we think its a great move for both parties timothy a rezvan  sterne agee crt okay i appreciate that color and then i guess moving forward will we see that impact flowing through on loe as we move into  grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president no so this – because late last year we did separate the businesses these are part of our well cost and those have been reflected in all of our  wells so you wont see it show up our loes or really more primarily well cost have already been including the separation of our water business timothy a rezvan  sterne agee crt okay thats all i had thank you operator the next question is from kevin maccurdy at heikkinen energy advisors kevin moreland maccurdy  heikkinen energy advisors llc good morning im curious on how you guys are estimating the ultimate hyperbolic declines on the utica wells given the continued flat production and if you think how you manage the choke makes a difference to the eventual decline daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yeah no i think thats a great question kevin i think to be honest its one that we dont even know what the true answer is going to be until we actually start to see some decline from this bigfoot well we are going to start seeing that data hopefully in the next couple of weeks i think we are just as eager as you guys are to begin really sharpening what our type curve is going to look like for the utica but again its still early and we are going to let the data really dictate what this thing looks like kevin moreland maccurdy  heikkinen energy advisors llc and so you dont think how you manage the choke changes what the eventual decline would be daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yeah i think it certainly does i mean if we let this well rip from day one at just open flow you are going to have a much higher initial decline but you are also going to have that much higher initial decline because you are starting from a much higher flow rate to begin with so when we are choking these wells back yeah we are not going to have the same absolute type of decline as a well thats wide open but on a relative basis on a percent of decline basis theres nothing that we are seeing that would suggest that it should be much shallower than those types of wells but only on a relative basis if that makes any sense kevin moreland maccurdy  heikkinen energy advisors llc yeah i appreciate the color thanks daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yep operator the next question is from gordon douthat at wells fargo gordon douthat  wells fargo securities llc morning everybody i jumped on the call a bit late so i apologize if you covered this earlier but my question has to do with on some – the gathering systems in the pennsylvania side some of your peers that have drilled the dry gas utica have talked about the need for a highpressure gathering system in addition to one they already have in place for the marcellus and if you were to embark on a more robust development program in the utica on the pennsylvania side how do you see that the pressure differences between the utica and the marcellus and the potential need for gathering playing out into that development process robert r wingo  senior vice presidentmidstream  marketing yeah sure this is rob we definitely oversized our system both for thirdparty opportunities and for opportunities like the utica so we expect very little capital will be required if we or others turn to utica then we start gathering it we might have some short pad connects into suction or compression but other than that the pipes got plenty of capacity and is ready to go gordon douthat  wells fargo securities llc would the pressures in the utica being higher than that in the marcellus constrain some of your marcellus production or how does that dynamic play out robert r wingo  senior vice presidentmidstream  marketing yeah thats what i was referring to with pad connects into the suction or discharge of compression we might instead of tying those pads into the lowpressure trunklines we might just carry them on to the discharge side of the compression so again really no impact to our marcellus wells gordon douthat  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator our next question is from dan braziller at jefferies daniel c braziller  jefferies llc good morning thanks for taking my question and congrats on the water dropdown and results i was just wondering on slide  of the supplemental i think this is the first time you guys have shown  guidance it seems to imply very strong growth can you just comment on some of the assumptions that went into deriving the  inbasin pricing in  thanks grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president are you talking about page  daniel c braziller  jefferies llc the basis exposure and realized pricing slide  dti m m yeah grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president yep thats just we do expect our production to continue to grow beyond  so we just bake in our expectations into our base exposure to get a realistic number out there daniel c braziller  jefferies llc okay sure it just seems like a fairly large jump to  from  is that mostly just – thats just production growth as opposed to any firm falling off or expiring grayson t lisenby  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah there are some projects some ft projects that come online in late  that we still expect to come online that weve risked the timing for conservatism so that number could very much shrink its not our ft profile necessarily dropping off but probably just conservatism on our part of when ft comes on so i think if people stay on time which is the most likely outcome i think youd see that red bar shrink daniel c braziller  jefferies llc okay thanks operator at this time i show no further questions would you like to make any closing remarks daniel j rice iv  chief executive officer  director yes thank you everybody for your

june     share facebook twitter daniel j rice iii step down from his moneyspinning position with blackrock inc five years back due to pressure from the board of directors for running a parallel business with his sons under the name of rice energy inc but no one thought that the decision would be so profitable for him in today’s time where that business got sold for  billion to eqt corp after the takeover announcement on monday eqt corp inc becomes the largest natural gas producing firm in the us exceeding to exxon mobil corp daniel rice iii seems to be very happy with the performance of all three sons who are currently the executives of the company according to the deal they would receive  billion as a share of a deal for their family’s stake in the rice energy inc shale production is in high demand in the us and this future prediction of mr rice a decade ago benefited him in the long run he risked his high profile position and money to enter the shale production sector and sowed the seed of rice energy inc with the help of his three sons daniel j rice iv  toby  and derek  contributed and supported the dream of mr rice and got that dream come true by converting it into a billion dollar company separation from blackrock inc didn’t harm mr rice professionally or financially and proved to be a good decision in his favour but it didn’t work well for blackrock inc for  million because they were fined by the us securities and exchange commission for not informing or disclosing rice’s participation in rice energy inc but it was too late to catch hold of rice because he already was on the verge of becoming a billionaire and got his company listed on the stock exchange in january  rice energy inc’s addition to the eqt corp inc is going to set the foot print for the company to enhance their skill sets to explore their opportunities to get much ahead of other competitors in the production of shale gas their aggressive approach helped them to get deeper to  billion cubic feet production of shale gas on a daily basis they were the first one to utilize high end technology and big data analytics to predict the demand and supply of the shale gas which ensured they always stayed ahead of their competitors in the race share thisclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on google opens in new window
