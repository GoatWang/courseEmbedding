organic herbs shop this farm about gilberties sal gilbertie is the rd generation proprietor of gilbertie’s herb gardens  petite edibles in westport and easton ct  he works the farm to this day together with his wife and children plus a small team of loyal helpers  located in this part of connecticut for over  years gilbertie’s grows some of the most beautiful organic microgreens and lettuces we’ve ever seen  what’s so special about gilbertie’s microgreens herbs and lettuces is that they are all soilgrown most microgreens are hydroponically grown – pretty enough but not comparable in flavor the gilberties have developed a custom soil blend that originally took  years to perfect they grow more than just microgreens in this magic dirt their arugula is out of this world  emerald green with a supple texture and the spicy bite of truly wild arugula  this certified organic soil ensures that each micro herb and leaf contains the highest amount of essential oil and taste  relying on integrated pest management techniques they release “beneficial” insects to deal with the “bad bugs”  the gilberties are quick to point out that although hydroponicallygrown crops are much easier to cultivate they cannot compare in flavor or nutrition to their soilgrown counterparts gilbertie’s farms provides certified organic products all over the north east they serve the community through generous donations to local gardens charities and schools and many free lectures and classes on the importance of growing organically to preserve our world and to eat more healthfully the gilbertie’s have also written a book called cooking with microgreens  it tells you everything you could possible want to know about growing microgreens at home describes every variety under the sun and helps you prepare dishes that feature them           for more than  years i have turned to sal for healthy productive plants  martha stewart find us in westport ct get directions wonderful products from
