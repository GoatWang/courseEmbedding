plaintiff respondent commercial radio nd defendant lam yuk wah rd defendant  nd appellant case albert cheng v tse wai chun paulprofile of albert cheng  known as taipan a public affairs radio commentator profile of tse wai chun paul  a solicitor background in september  mr au wing cheung mr au was instructed by his then employer select tours international company limited select tours to lead a tour group to the philippines background on  september  when the tour group was going through the customs in manila airport mr au and a member of the tour group mr wong chuen ming mr wong were arrested together with a number of other members of the group for trafficking in a drug which was commonly known as ice both mr au and mr wong were prosecuted convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the court in the philippines this had attracted a lot of publicity in hong kong some people believed that mr au and mr wong were innocent they formed various groups organising campaigns seeking their release one of these groups was the tourist industry rescue group of which select tours was a member and the plaintiff its honorary legal adviser the st defendant had also organised another group and various activities which were aimed at the same objective background as a result of the campaigns by these various groups mr au and mr wong were released by the government of the philippines in july  and returned to hong kong they were accompanied by various people including the plaintiff and the st defendant understandably different people claimed credit for the successful return of mr au and mr wong after mr aus return to hong kong there was a suggestion that he should claim compensation from his exemployer select tours for the period in which he was detained in the philippines ie from september  to july  it would seem that the plaintiff had advised mr au not to make the claim whereas the st defendant urged him to do so the conversation in question on st august  the st and rd defendants were cohosts in a phonein radio talk show broadcast on the chinese channel of the commercial radio which was run by the nd defendant the name of the programme was teacup in a storm during the programme the st and rd defendants said something about the plaintiff which the plaintiff alleged was defamatory of him it was a conversation between the two defendants a record of the conversation together with a translation thereof were annexed to the reamended statement of claim the plaintiff alleged that the st and rd defendants had defamed him by saying that he was one of those people who had subjected mr au and his family to threat and intimidation during mr aus detention in the philippines and that he had given advice to mr au on mr aus claim for compensation from his previous employer select tours having regard only to the interest of the travel industry but not that of mr au thus it was alleged that the st and rd defendants had imputed that the plaintiff had acted unprofessionally unethically and allowed himself to be put into a position of conflict of interest defences and reply in response to the claim the three defendants raised the following defences  the statements complained of did not refer to the plaintiff and were not defamatory  they were true or substantially true and  in so far as they consisted of expressions of opinion they constituted fair comment on a matter of public interest defences and reply in reply to the defendants defences the plaintiff pleaded that the st and rd defendants published the words complained of maliciously as particulars of malice it was alleged that  the st and rd defendants knew andor believed that the words were untrue  they published the words with reckless disregard as to whether the words were true or false and  the words were published with certain motives as particulars of such motives the plaintiff relied on a number of matters namely the st and  rd defendants wanted  to persuade mr au into pursuing his claim against select tours for compensation  to pressurize select tours into compensating mr au  to gratify their animosity against the plaintiff and select tours  to belittle the efforts of the plaintiff and to distinguish the st defendants efforts with regard to giving assistance to mr au and  to raise a new controversy so as to arouse the interest of the audience in continuing to listen to their programme the trial judge the trial judge had ruled that there was no evidence of malice on the part of the nd defendant he also ruled that there was no evidence that the rd defendant knew or believed the words to be true or had any animosity against the plaintiff or wanted to belittle the efforts of the plaintiff the trial judge hon chan cjhc after a trial before yuen j and a jury on the plaintiffs claim for damages for defamation against the  defendants the jury awarded  to the plaintiff against the st and rd defendants and held the nd defendant not liable this is an appeal by the st and rd defendants against the verdict of the jury the defendants claimed that the remarks objected to were fair comment the jury found against the two individual defendants it had to be assumed  on the basis of malice the court of appeal rejected their appeals the defendants appealed to the court of final appeal court of final appeal january chief justice li the court unanimously allows the appeal and makes the following orders  the jurys verdicts regarding mr cheng and mr lam are quashed  the orders made against them by yuen j and the court of appeal are set aside  a new trial extending to all issues is ordered as against mr cheng and mr lam as to costs the court unanimously makes an order nisi in the terms set out in my judgment reports after verdict chief justice li the freedom of speech the freedom of speech or the freedom of expression is a freedom that is essential to hong kongs civil society it is constitutionally guaranteed by the basic law article  the right of fair comment is a most important element in the freedom of speech in a society which greatly values the freedom of speech and safeguards it by a constitutional guarantee it is right that the courts when considering and developing the common law should not adopt a narrow approach to the defence of fair comment see eastern express publisher ltd v mo man ching   hkcfar  at  the courts should adopt a generous approach so that the right of fair comment on matters of public interest is maintained in its full vigour costs as lord nicholls of birkenhead npj pointed out the legal arguments on the issue of malice raised before the court of appeal and this court were not raised before the judge no argument was advanced before the judge that the motives particularised under head  and  would not in law defeat the defence of fair comment in the circumstances i would make the following order nisi on costs  there be no order as to costs before the judge  the respondent should pay the appellants costs in the appeal to the court of appeal and this court lord nicholls of birkenhead npj this is an appeal in a defamation action it raises an important point on the defence of fair comment the title of this defence is misleading comment or honest comment would be a more satisfactory name in this judgment i adhere reluctantly to the traditional terminology  fair commentthe objective limits fivefold in order to identify the point in issue i must first set out some noncontroversial matters about the ingredients of this defence these are well established they are fivefold fair commentthe objective limits fivefold first the comment must be on a matter of public interest public interest is not to be confined within narrow limits today see lord denning in london artists ltd v littler   qb   second the comment must be recognisable as comment as distinct from an imputation of fact if the imputation is one of fact a ground of defence must be sought elsewhere for example justification or privilege much learning has grown up around the distinction between fact and comment for present purposes it is sufficient to note that a statement may be one or the other depending on the context ferguson j gave a simple example in the new south wales case of   myerson v smiths weekly  sr nsw   to say that a mans conduct was dishonourable is not comment it is a statement of fact to say that he did certain specific things and that his conduct was dishonourable is a statement of fact coupled with a comment fair commentthe objective limits fivefold third the comment must be based on facts which are true or protected by privilege see for instance london artists ltd v littler   qb   if the facts on which the comment purports to be founded are not proved to be true or published on a privilege occasion the defence of fair comment is not available next the comment must explicitly or implicitly indicate at least in general terms what are the facts on which the comment is being made the reader or hearer should be in a position to judge for himself how far the comment was well founded fair commentthe objective limits fivefold finally the comment must be one which could have been made by an honest person however prejudiced he might be and however exaggerated or obstinate his views see lord porter in turner v metrogoldwynmayer pictures ltd   aer   commenting on an observation of lord esher mr in merivale v carson   qbd   it must be germane to the subject matter criticised dislike of an artists style would not justify an attack upon his morals or manners but a critic need not be mealymouthed in denouncing what he disagrees with he is entitled to dip his pen in gall for the purposes of legitimate criticism see jordan cj in gardiner v fairfax   sr nsw    malice the plaintiff may still defeat rebut the defence by proving that when he made his comment the defendant was in the timehallowed expression actuated by malice in ordinary usage malice carries connotations of spite and illwill in legal usage malice sometimes bears its popular meaning sometimes not it is an imprecise term historically even within the bounds of the law of defamation malice has borne more than one meaning historically defamation lay in publishing the words complained of falsely and maliciously in this context malice meant merely that publication had been a wrongful act done intentionally and without lawful excuse see bayley j in bromage v prosser   bc   this was sometimes called malice in law as distinct from malice in fact but even malice in fact otherwise known as express malice or actual malice may cover states of mind which are not malicious in the ordinary sense of the word this is so in the context of the defence of qualified privilege it is no wonder that lord bramwell described malice as that unfortunate word see abrath v north eastern railway co   app cas   lord nicholls the defence of fair comment which are objective malice is subjective when making the defamatory comment the defendant acted dishonestly the law protects the freedom to express opinions not vituperative makebelieve the legal issue on this appeal whether in contemplation of law malice may exist in this context even when the defendant positively believed in the soundness of his comment whether the purpose for which a defendant stated an honestly held opinion may deprive him of the protection of the defence of fair comment for instance if his purpose was to inflict injury as when a politician seeks to damage his political opponent or if he was simply acting out of spite the meaning of malice has been comprehensively analysed in relation to the defence of qualified privilege most notably in the speech of lord diplock in horrocks v lowe  ac  indeed there has been surprisingly little judicial discussion of this subject over the last  years the english report of the committee on defamation published in  stated that under the present state of the law a person was acting maliciously where he was dishonest or reckless or actuated by spite illwill or any other indirect or improper motive see para  on this appeal the defendants challenged this view of the law motive honesty required that the defendants genuinely believed the comments they made anything less would not do if they knew their comments were untrue or were recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity of their comments they were acting dishonestly proof of malice is the means whereby a plaintiff can defeat a defence of fair comment where a defendant is abusing the defence abuse consists of using the defence for a purpose other than that for which it exists the purpose for which the defence of fair comment exists is to facilitate freedom of expression by commenting on matters of public interest this accords with the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression and it is in the public interest that everyone should be free to express his own honestly held views on such matters subject always to the safeguards provided by the objective limits mentioned above public interest the public interest in freedom to make comments within these limits is of particular importance in the social and political fields professor fleming stated the matter thus in his invaluable book on the law of torts th edition p   untrammelled discussion of public affairs and of those participating in them is a basic safeguard against irresponsible political power the unfettered preservation of the right of fair comment is therefore one of the foundations supporting our standards of personal liberty the purpose and importance of the defence of fair comment are inconsistent with its scope being restricted to comments made for particular reasons or particular purposes some being regarded as proper others not especially in the social and political fields those who make public comments usually have some objective of their own in mind even if it is only to publicise and advance themselves they often have what may be described as an ulterior object public interest liberty to make such comments genuinely held on matters of public interest lies at the heart of the defence of fair comment that is the very object for which the defence exists commentators of all shades of opinion are entitled to have their own agenda politicians social reformers busybodies those with political or other ambitions and those with none all can grind their axes the defence of fair comment envisages that everyone is at liberty to conduct social and political campaigns by expressing his own views subject always nor is it for the courts to choose between public and private purposes or between purposes they regard as morally or socially or politically desirable and those they regard as undesirable that would be a highly dangerous course that way lies censorship that would defeat the purpose for which the law accords the defence of freedom to make comments on matters of public interest the objective safeguards coupled with the need to have a genuine belief in what is said are adequate to keep the ambit of permissible comment within reasonable bounds spiteful comments one particular motive calls for special mention spite or illwill this raises a difficult point i confess that my first instinctive reaction was that the defence of fair comment should not be capable of being used to protect a comment made with the intent of injuring another out of spite even if the person who made the comment genuinely believed in the truth of what he said personal spite after all is four square within the popular meaning of malice elsewhere the law proscribes conduct of this character for instance in the field of nuisance as exemplified by the well known case of the householder who made noises on musical instruments with the intention of annoying his neighbour christie v davey   ch  the comment is one which is based on fact it is made in circumstances where those to whom the comment is addressed can form their own view on whether or not the comment was sound and the comment is one which can be held by an honest person the spiteful publication of a defamatory statement of fact attracts no remedy if the statement is proved to be true case horrocks v lowe the defence of qualified privilege   lord diplocks authoritative analysis of malice for the purposes of the defence of qualified privilege with a view to seeing how far it is applicable to the defence of fair comment   even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion  may not suffice to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other that that for which the privilege is accorded by the law the commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest but to give vent to his personal spite or ill will towards the person he defames p  case horrocks v lowe lord diplock continued by noting that there may be other improper motives which destroy the privilege he instanced the case where a defendants dominant motive may have been to obtain some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constitutes the reason for the privilege instances of misuse of qualified privilege may not be instances of misuse of fair comment   the rationale of the defence of qualified privilege is the laws recognition that there are circumstances when there is a need in the public interest for a particular recipient to receive frank and uninhibited communication of particular information from a particular source see reynolds v times newspapers ltd   wlr     the rationale of the defence of fair comment is different and is different in a material respect it is not based on any notion of performance of a duty or protection of an interest the fair comment cases merivale v carson   qbd  thomas v bradbury agnew co ltd   kb  the position was similar in slim v daily telegraph ltd   qb  a decision of the court of appeal the action arose from the publication in a newspaper of a letter which commented adversely on the conduct of a former town clerk lord denning mr at page  said that the writer must honestly express his real view so long as he does this he has nothing to fear diplock j seems there to have regarded intention to injure or other ulterior motive as antithetical to honesty on the footing that when a person is actuated by such a motive the view which he expresses will not be his genuine view it is to be noted however that malice was not suggested in that case the fair comment cases blackburn j sitting in the supreme court of the australian capital territory in renouf v federal capital press of australia pty ltd  actr  blackburn j noted that unlike with the defence of qualified privilege malice in the context of fair comment cannot simply be characterised as the abuse of a special legal relationship everything must turn on the state of mind of the person making the comment proof that the comment was motivated by a desire to embarrass or prejudice the plaintiff is not sufficient to constitute malice it must be shown to have distorted the judgment of the defendant before it can avail the plaintiff the fair comment cases if the plaintiff can show that the opinion represented by the comment was affected by personal hostility or some such irrelevant motive in such a way that it does not represent a disinterested judgment upon the matter which is the subject of the comment then the reply of malice succeeds notwithstanding that it is not proved that the comment was insincere  ie did not represent the defendants real opinion it seems to me that unless this is so the law ignores the common human experience that personal animosity may perfectly consort with sincerity to produce a comment which is harmful and unfair the fair comment cases lord nicholls of birkenhead npj disagrees with blackburn js a comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not genuinely hold the view he expressed honesty of belief is the touchstone actuation by spite animosity intent to injure intent to arouse controversy or other motivation whatever it may be even if it is the dominant or sole motive does not of itself defeat the defence however proof of such motivation may be evidence sometimes compelling evidence from which lack of genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred proof of motivation may also be relevant on other issues in the action such as damages the chief judge concluded that the summing up was in line with the rationale behind the defence and in accordance with the law as stated in horrocks v lowe motives of comments   the first motive they have pleaded is that they wanted to persuade mr au wingcheung to sue select tours     to pressurise select tours into compensating mr au wingcheung     to gratify their animosity against the plaintiff andor select tours      to belittle the efforts of the plaintiff in distinguishing the st defendants efforts in assisting mr au  to raise a new controversy and thereby arousing the publics interest in continuing to listen to the teacup in a storm programme motives of comments proof of malice is the means whereby a plaintiff can defeat a defence of fair comment where a defendant is abusing the defence abuse consists of using the defence for a purpose other than that for which it exists the purpose for which the defence of fair comment exists is to facilitate freedom of expression by commenting on matters of public interest this accords with the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression commentators of all shades of opinion are entitled to have their own agenda politicians social reformers busybodies those with political or other ambitions and those with none all can grind their axes nor is it for the courts to choose between public and private purposes or between purposes they regard as morally or socially or politically desirable and those they regard as undesirable that would be a highly dangerous course that way lies censorship motives of comments the cheng case caused a flurry of newspaper comment some suggested that it ws unfair to plaintiffs others suggested that lord nicholls was somehow going too far in changing the common law especially as an expatriate judge in hong kong he did not of course do so alone in fact the rest of the court unanimously supported him the cheng case does not deal with the position where for example the statement is contained in a letter written to the press and the editor has no malice but the letter writer does however the current view of the meaning of fair will permit the paper to raise the defence if the statement could have been made by an honest person and they will only be defeated by their own malice and not that of the writer of the letter jill cottrell per lord nicholls of birkenhead npj the freedom of speech was constitutionally guaranteed by art of the basic law the right of fair comment was a most important element in the freedom of speech and when considering the right the courts should adopt a generous approach so that the right was maintained in its full vigour eastern express publisher ltd another v mo man ching another   hkcfar applied seepfh   the common law of england and hong kong recognizes a fair comment defence to defamation actions the accepted core of this defence is the right of any person to comment on matters of public concern provided that the comment is based on identifiable and true or privileged statements of fact hong kong residents shall have freedom of speech of the press and of publication freedom of association of assembly of procession and of demonstration and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions and to strike article  basic law   critiques  this is a radical departure from the law as it stood before  it was formulated by a judge with no roots in and no understanding of hong kong and no accountability to the hong kong people  that is for these reasons inappropriate for hong kong  it tilts the balance too far especially in nonpolitical contexts against private rights points  are taken from the remarks of ma lik a hong kong member of the national peoples congress point  is taken from an article by shiu sinpor executive director of one country two systems research institute jill cottrell i favour that decision and hope hat it will be adopted in other common law jurisdictions i recognise that the price may be that the feelings of some individuals will be hurt it is not a pleasant experience to have ones actions motives and morals publicly commented on even if it is clear that the statement is a comment however in modern literate societies freedom of speech on matters of public interest is something which can only enhance the informed involvement of citizens in public affairs it represents a natural development of law not a radical departure jill cottrell fair comment judges and politics in hong kong  about powershowcom powershowcom is a leading presentationslideshow sharing website whether your

aka ving tsun wing tsun etc is considered the worlds most technically advanced and devastating form of handtohand combat it is the original mixedmartial art of ancient china called the sawedoff shotgun of the martial arts world it can be learned very quickly and is designed specifically to defeat other martial arts as well as stronger bigger and faster opponents here you will find the largest selection of wing chun products in the world click to learn more or start shopping by clicking a link above wing chun is a chinese style of kungfu that was made famous by students of grandmaster yip man ip man such as bruce lee william cheung and wong shun leung the art came to prominence due to ip mans students winning a large number of challenge matches beimo against kungfu masters and muaythai fighters in the s and s ip man stated that if one of his students lost a fight after learning the second wing chun form he would jump off the roof of a building since then wing chun has become one of the most practiced martial arts in the world it focuses on simple direct efficient and simultaneous attacks and defenses you will notice that wing chun varies greatly from person to person or from lineage to lineage even though many people all trained under ip man this is due to the way ip man taught at different stages of his life the understanding of the student and the personal interpretations and changes by the student over time wing chun is a kungfu style based on theory rather than technique and thus very customizable to the individual practitioner there are also some nonyip man lineages of wing chun that are very good the systems components the main emptyhand forms inwing chun are sil lum tao little idea form chum kiu searching bridge and biu jee shooting fingers there is also the extremely famous wing chun wooden dummy mook yan jong and the wing chun weapons forms for the butterfly swords bart jaam do and long pole luk dim boon kwan or dragon pole wing chun also has a tripodal form for kicks a few lineages use the training rings rattan rings iron rings and there are many other minor components that vary throughout the different lineages wing chun is also known for its chi sao sensitivity drill also known as sticky hands and lesser known chi gerk or sticky legs which enable the practitioner to fight by the sense of touch alone and cover his or her openings while striking the opponent you will often see this demonstrated with one practitioner wearing a blindfold and fighting blind you will also find conditioning iron palm training and mui fa jong plum flower post and footwork training in many wing chun lineages as well books and dvd videos are available on all of these major components of the system as well as wing chun techniques sparringfighting selfdefense history philosophy theory drills ground fighting and more we have any training equipment and weapons you might need to practice this incredible martial art and a variety of other merchandise including ditdajow healing liniments artwork collectibles and our famous wall bags for increasing your punching power lastly we carry home study programs if you dont have a school nearby but if you want to learn everything you can online courses at the wing chun university teach the entire system and all its components about the different spellings of wing chun you will notice that the name of the art is spelled many different ways  wing chun ving tsun weng chun wing tsun wing tsjun wing tzun wing tjun vinh xuan etc the original spelling was wing chun and this is still the most common spelling used across all lineages this was later supposedly changed to ving tsun due to the fact that the british that were occupying hong kong were making fun of the initials wc which refers to water closet or a bathroom the spelling was supposed suggested by wong shun leung or yip man the ving tsun athletic association in hong kong which was established in  was the first to use this spelling by using different spellings organizations and schools generally want to indicate that they have a certain trademarked version of the system wing tsun was leung tings way of trademarking his style of the art and wing tjun wing tsjun wing tzun etc are all students of that lineage that broke away and still teach weng chun is an older lineage of the art taught in china and vinh xuan is the vietnamese lineage traditional wing chun is william chungs trademarked version of the artapplied wing chun is duncan leungs trademarked version of the art although the spellings above reflect different wing chun lineages much of the spelling differences within the system itself are simply due to a lack of standardization in the romanization of the chinese words the chinese writing consists only of symbols the different spellings have arisen by translating the consonance of the chinese character to a western phonetical alphabet most order ship the same day orders
