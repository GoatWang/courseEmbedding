ivan michael ironside as miller larry gilliard as jackson reg e cathey as jones anna massey as mrs shrike directed by brad anderson written by scott kosar drama horror indie mystery thriller rated r for violence and disturbing images  minutes    roger ebert november        print page tweet if you were any thinner stevie tells him you wouldnt exist trevor reznik weighs  pounds and you wince when you look at him he is a lonely man disliked at work up all night returning needfully to two women who are kind to him stevie a hooker and marie the waitress at the allnight diner out at the airport i havent slept in a year he tells mariechristian bale lost more than  pounds to play this role a fact i share not because you need to know how much weight he lost but because you need to know that it is indeed christian bale he is so gaunt his face so hollow he looks nothing like the actor were familiar with there are moments when his appearance even distracts from his performance because we worry about him certainly we believe that the character trevor is at the end of his rope and i was reminded of anthony perkins work in orson welles the trial another film about a man who finds himself trapped in the vise of the worlds madness advertisement trevor works as a machinist theres a guy like him in every union shop a guy who knows all the rules and works according to them and is a pain in the ass about them his coworkers think he is strange maybe he frightens them a little his boss asks for a urine sample one day he gets distracted and as a result one of his coworkers loses a hand the victim miller michael ironside almost seems less upset about the accident than trevor is but then trevor has no reserve no padding his nerve endings seem exposed to pain and disappointmentstevie jennifer jason leigh is a consolation they have sex yes but thats the least of it she sees his need trevor is reading dostoyevskys the idiot and perhaps there is a parallel between stevie and nastassia dostoyevskys heroine who is drawn to a selfdestructive and dangerous man leigh has played a lot of prostitutes in her career but each one is different because she defines them by how they are needed as well as by what they needmarie aitana sanchezgijon is the other side of the coin a cheerful presence in the middle of the night youre lonely she tells trevor when you work graveyard shift as long as i have you get to know the type she wonders why he comes all the way out to the airport just for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie she wouldnt mind dating himthen there is the matter of ivan john sharian the distracting and disturbing coworker who perhaps contributed to the accident he lost some fingers in a drill press once and the docs replaced them with his toes i cant shuffle cards like i used to he says nor apparently can he punch in on the time clock the guys at the shop claim he doesnt exist is trevor imagining him and what is the meaning of the postit notes that look like an incomplete version of a hangman puzzlethe machinist has an ending that provides a satisfactory or at least a believable explanation for its mysteries and contradictions but the movie is not about the plot and while the conclusion explains trevors anguish it doesnt account for it the director brad anderson working from a screenplay by scott kosar wants to convey a state of mind and he and bale do that with disturbing effectiveness the photography by xavi gimenez and charlie jiminez is cold slates blues and grays the palate of despair we see trevors world so clearly through his eyes that only gradually does it occur to us that every life is seen through a filter advertisement we get up in the morning in possession of certain assumptions through which all of our experiences must filter we cannot be rid of those assumptions although an evolved person can at least try to take them into account most people never question their assumptions and so reality exists for them as they think it does whether it does or not some assumptions are necessary to make life bearable such as the assumption that we will not die in the next  minutes others may lead us as they lead trevor into a bleak solitude near the end of the movie we understand him when he simply says i just want to sleep reveal comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus comments powered by

see the machinist machinist at lathe machinery repairman creates helicopter part aboard aircraft carrier a machinist is a person who uses machine tools to make or modify parts primarily metal parts this process of machining is accomplished by using machine tools to cut away excess material much as a woodcarver cuts away excess wood to produce his work in addition to metal the parts may be made of many other kinds of materials such as plastic or wood products the goal of these cutting operations is to produce a part that conforms to a set of specifications or tolerances usually in the form

refers to a person who manufactures mechanical parts turner and assembles fitter those parts together to manufacture a mechanical device role in manufacturingedit a machinist is usually called upon when a part needs to be produced from a material by cutting such a part may be unique or may be needed in the thousands this could include a machinery part for a production line or anything that can be made from metal or plastic producing a part will often require several steps and more than one machine tool each machine tool plays a specific role in cutting away excess material when large numbers of parts are needed production planning is required to plan the most logical workflow through a series of machines computer numerical controlled cnc machines are a special computerdriven tool that can machine a large variety of shapes and whose use in the workflow depends on the part to be machined cnc machines are becoming the standard due to their speed precision flexibility and reduced downtime while changing jobs production runs consisting of large numbers of parts are more cost effective and commonly referred to as production work in the trade conversely small production runs are sometimes referred to as prototype or jobbing work production engineers use blueprints and engineering drawings to produce detailed specifications of the part especially its geometry shape then decide on a strategy to make it machine tools are then configured by the machinist or toolset and production commences the machinist works with the quality department to ensure the specifications are maintained in the finished product machinist inspecting a cnc lathe large commercial organizations often staff machinists on site in a maintenance mode to ensure continuing operations of the production machinery the labor cost for this role is significantly lower than costs involved with production shutdowns materials commonly encountered by machinistsedit a machinist is to metal as a woodcarver is to wood the most common materials that machinists make parts from are steel aluminium brass copper and various alloys of these materials other less common materials such as vanadium zinc lead or manganese are often used as alloying elements for the most common materials materials that machinists work with occasionally are plastics rubber glass and wood products rarely machinists also work with exotic and refractory metals the term exotic metals is a general term describing out of the ordinary rare or special purpose metals a synonym might be spaceage a list of exotic metals might include but is not limited to titanium beryllium vanadium chromium molybdenum and tungsten as well as special hightemperature metal alloys like inconel or hastelloy superalloys very often the meaning of the term suggests the need for specialized handling andor tooling to machine them effectively while the foregoing were primarily the materials that a machinist would be cutting the cutters that the machinist uses must be harder and tougher than the materials to be cut the materials in the cutters a machinist uses are most commonly high speed steel tungsten carbide ceramics borazon and diamond machinists usually work to very small tolerances usually within  or  mm more commonly expressed as ±plus or minus tenthousandths of an inch or ± mm and sometimes at tolerances as low as  plus or minus one tenth of a thousandth of an inch – or  mm for specialty operations a machinist deals with all facets of shaping cutting and some aspects of forming metal although forming is typically a separate trade the operations most commonly performed by machinists are milling drilling turning and grinding there are other more specialised operations that a machinist will less frequently be called upon to perform such as honing keyseating lapping and polishing to name a few tools of the machinistedit the tools that a machinist is expected to be proficient with fall into  broad categories measuring tools the measuring tools come in several basic varieties comparison tools such as adjustable parallels and plain calipers direct reading tools such as rules scales and vernier calipers micrometer tools based on screw threads indicator tools based on clockwork gear movements electronic measuring tools based on transducers many of these are digital versions of their mechanical predecessors as with a digital caliper hand tools the hand tools are the usual complement of tools found in a complete auto mechanics set except that auto specialty tools would be absent and some outsized tools would likely be present such as    mm open end wrench machine tools the machine tools have undergone a dramatic shift in the last  years manual machines have given way to computer numerically controlled machines cncs for claritys sake a categorization based on the historical groupings will be offered each of these groupings has been altered by the advent of cncs and the cncs meld some groups and blur the lines between others in the past the most common machine tools fall into  categories drilling machines bench floor radial and horizontal milling machines horizontal vertical and boring mills

is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on
