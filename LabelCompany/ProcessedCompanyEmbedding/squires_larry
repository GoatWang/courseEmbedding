protection bureau was able to curb important unsafe and unfair practices that led to the recent financial crisis in interviews with key government industry and advocacy groups along with deep archival research kirsch and squires show where the cfpb was able to overcome many abusive practices where it was less able to do so and why open for business in  the cfpb was congresss response to the financial catastrophe that shattered millions of middleclass and lowerincome households and threatened the stability of the global economy but only a few years later with us economic conditions on a path to recovery there are already disturbing signs of the reemergence of the highrisk highreward credit practices that the cfpb was designed to curb this book profiles how the bureau has attempted to stop abusive and discriminatory lending practices in the mortgage and automobile lending sectors and documents the multilayered challenges faced by an untested new regulatory agency in its efforts to transform the broken—but lucrative—business practices of the financial services industryauthors kirsch and squires raise the question of whether the consumer protection approach to financial services reform will succeed over the long term in light of political and business efforts to scuttle it case studies of mortgage and automobile lending reforms highlight the key contextual and structural conditions that explain the cfpbs ability to transform financial service industry business models and practices meltdown the financial crisis consumer protection and the road forward is essential

squires have penned the definitive chronicle of the first years of a transformative federal agency—the cfpb they have combined rigorous archival research with indepth interviews of key insiders to help readers understand the enormous challenges that faced the bureau as it took on what many consider to be the most powerful lobbying force in the nation—the financial services industry there are lessons here for the general public but also for policymakers students of policy making and advocates looking to build a more equitable economic playing field—dan immergluck professor school of city and regional planning georgia institute of technologythis book provides an interesting readable account of how director richard cordray and others shaped the approach of the newly formed cfpb to its role as the preeminent consumer financial services regulatory agency and the challenges and opposition some of which came from me and my law firm faced by the bureau as it embarked on its initial initiatives even the bureau’s closest observers are likely to learn something new from the book’s account of the bureau’s early efforts directed at mortgage origination and auto lending the book combines considerable research with indepth interviews to offer an appraisal that will interest scholars practitioners and readers of current politics and policy—alan s kaplinsky chair consumer financial services group and editorinchief of cfpb monitor blog at ballard spahr llpafter the  economic collapse consumer civil rights and labor groups went all in for thenprofessor elizabeth warren’s idea of a consumer agency to protect pocketbooks and wallets now just after the cfpb’s fifth birthday kirsch and squires go behind the scenes to explore why some of the young agency’s leaders moved in the directions that they did to fight the endemic problems that cfpb director richard cordray calls the four ds deception debt traps dead ends and discrimination the book is an important addition to the public record about an agency that is controversial only to the powerful special interests that oppose it but necessary to the consumers who have a safer financial marketplace because of it—edmund mierzwinski us pirg consumer program director and senior fellowan indispensable account of the birth of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and its tumultuous early years with a richly documented analysis of the bureau’s pivotal battles to tame the nation’s mortgage market and police discrimination in auto lending drawing on extensive interviews with enthusiasts as well as critics

vision for consumer financial protection—vanessa gail perry phd professor of marketing strategic management and public policy the george washington university school of businesskirsch and squires are consumer law shamans who have a deep contextual understanding of the consumer market and the competing interests of all its market participants they are clearly adept at much more than reading tea leaves and their extensive experience and engaging manner of addressing the topic at hand makes meltdown a gripping read and a thoughtprovoking biography of the cfpb and the importance of context for purposes of charting the regulatory maze this book is a must–read for consumer agencies and anyone with a keen interest in consumer law it is clearly most timely in view of the political interest in the cfpb in the us congress and administration i will definitely be passing it on to my colleagues at the soontobe established financial sector conduct authority that forms part of south africa’s imminent move towards a twin peaks system of regulation and am confident that studying the observations by kirsch and squires will avoid many liftoff headaches and a sharper focus for future intervention—corlia van heerden professor and barclays africa chair in banking law in africa university of pretoria faculty of law south africa look inside other titles of interest product search
