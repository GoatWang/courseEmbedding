tv mogul bonnie hammer’s secrets of success bonnie hammer the new head of seven cable channels at nbc universal photo adam fedderly it’s hard enough to persuade one person to fall in love with a product now try  million seven nights a week such is the power of bonnie hammer newly minted head of seven cable channels at nbc universal in  she revived the syfy channel luring in viewers with ron moore’s revamped battlestar galactica then hammer took over as president of the usa network where she linked beefy wrestlers wwe to quivering neurotics monk under the chirpy rubric “characters welcome” and it worked usa has been the number one basic cable network for five years valued at  billion the yearold queens native explains her plans to make other nbc universal channels grab your eyeballs wired lots of entertainment executives claim to make decisions with their gut you however have a checklist—a “brand filter” bonnie hammer for usa it’s three things is there a slightly flawed but likable lead character is there a strong drama with a dollop of humor is it blue skies i mean that literally and figuratively exterior shots showing blue skies add a levity and brightness to each show you also have to be able to describe it in a single sentence royal pains—it’s marcus welby in the hamptons wired so where did “characters welcome” fit in bonnie hammer we had to figure out a way to tie together the wrestlers of the wwe with the furry critters of the westminster kennel club and the quirky characters on monk every show has that crucial element but we tweak each one so it’s distinct we’ve built a loyal fan base because viewers believe we’ll make them happy wired what about networks with other vibes will you have a checklist for each bonnie hammer channel brand is so key i think most broadcasters choose their series then try to make a mosaic of a schedule we’re the opposite—we will not choose a show if it doesn’t fit exactly into our jigsaw puzzle wired you have the gamedriven g in your stable now what can you do with that bonnie hammer i’m just trying to get my arms around it the kids who are gaming aren’t watching television so you have to figure out what their psychographic is—what they like what they want it will be a challenge wired what was your take on the saturday night live skit about a game show that asks “what is burn notice” that was one of your
