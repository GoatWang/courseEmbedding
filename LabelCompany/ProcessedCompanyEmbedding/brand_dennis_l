beauty industry how to embrace multiculturalism on a mission sheamoisture ceo richelieu dennis is persuading retailers to move his products off of the “ethnic” beauty shelves by elizabeth segran minute readthere are few places in american life where putting up a sign separating ethnicities is considered even remotely acceptable so why should the beauty aisle at your local drugstore be an exception there you’re likely to find that shampoos and moisturizers for africanamerican women are not located in the main beauty section but are on separate shelves marked “ethnic” in april of this year sheamoisture the natural beauty brand of choice for millions of black consumers decided to rattle those shelvesadvertisement related sheamoisture brings “ethnic” empowerment to the beauty aisle sheamoisture’s breakthewalls campaign created with droga included an online call to action and its first national tv commercial the second spot took viewers through a store from the perspective of women of color depicting how unpleasant the simple act of buying beauty products can be“is ‘ethnic’ not beautiful” the narrator asks “am i not beautiful” the video went viral garnering  million views within the first  hours and more than  million views over the next three weeks while the accompanying hashtag earned sheamoisture  million impressions on social media heritage brand dennis based his original shea butter products on his grandmother’s recipes the campaign’s architect was richelieu dennis the founder and ceo of sundial brands which includes sheamoisture nubian heritage and the recently launched madam cj walker beauty culture a premium haircare line exclusively available at sephora sundial pulled in an estimated  million in revenue in  an increase of  yearoveryear such growth caught the attention of bain capital which in september  acquired a minority stake in the familyowned company for an undisclosed amount valuing it at an estimated  million it takes a village a cornerstone of sheamoisture’s operation is its fairtrade production program that helps benefit suppliers here’s how it works find female suppliers sundial starts by identifying highquality sources for its ingredients including shea butter shea soap and baobab oil the company currently buys from more than  women in ghana and turkey and plans to add suppliers in brazil jamaica kenya and morocco this year put community first the company’s community commerce team works with suppliers to identify local needs “we see what investments sundial can make that will improve their lives like making the process more environmentally friendly or bringing piped water into the area” says sean hall vp of community commerce create the products after harvesting ingredients are sent to savannah fruits a ghanabased company that weighs and tests them before shipping them to sundial’s factories in new york and amsterdam where they undergo chemicalfree refining and are added to products complete the circle sheamoisture creates nearly four dozen community commerce–labeled products which are distributed to more than  leading retailers nationwide ten percent of the gross sales of these items are channeled back into community commerce initiatives bain—and dennis—are betting on the same thing that sundial’s multicultural products will have mass appeal when placed outside the ethnic aisle and with sheamoisture recently surpassing burt’s bees as the topselling natural brand in the bath and body category in the us their faith seems wellplaced with the investment from bain dennis expects sundial’s distribution footprint to grow from its current  stores which include cvs walmart and target to a total of  by next year “people want ingredients they can pronounce that have a history and a story to them” says dennisthe brand has come a long way from  years ago when dennis was living in new york city and hawking sheabutter shampoos by the pound on the streets of harlem at the time dennis was displaced in the united states as civil war broke out in his native liberia “our home was destroyed” he says “we had to ask ourselves what to do to survive until we could return” dennis his mother and a close friend from college turned to the family business in africa his grandmother had supported her children by crafting soaps and lotions from local plants using her recipes dennis’s family began making natural beauty products in their tiny queens apartment dennis recalls struggling to convince potential buyers that they weren’t just selling snake oil “there weren’t any natural beauty companies serving multicultural consumers” he saysnatural is now becoming the norm over the past six years the natural beauty market has seen doubledigit growth it’s currently worth  billion globally making up  of the overall beauty market sundial has benefited from this trend and the explosive rise of multicultural beauty a third of the us population after all is not white and this group has historically spent more on beauty productsas he grew sundial from its cramped queens digs to its current amityville new york headquarters dennis anticipated these changes adding brands and pushing out everything from lipsticks to baby shampoos in  he also certified it as a b corporation confirming the company’s commitment to giving back to the communities where it sources ingredients see “it takes a village” just as important he positioned his products not simply as multicultural but crosscultural rather than explicitly targeting black women the company sells items that can treat a broad range of conditions—from acne to eczema to frizzy hair—that transcend race “we want women to have options and not be forced into somebody else’s idea of what their beauty needs ought to be” says dennisadvertisement empire builder dennis’s yearold natural beauty company spans three brands and hundreds of productsphoto arturo olmos it’s an approach with significant potential especially when it comes to hair care “certain products and certain natural ingredients as well as clinical ingredients are beneficial for many different hair types” says karen grant an analyst at market research firm npd group “we need to move away from thinking that this is some little niche market it’s an untapped opportunity in the haircare market”breakthewalls was the first step today sundial is working with retail partners such as target to move its products off specialty shelves and encouraging them to rethink such aisles altogether if it all goes according to plan sheamoisture will no longer be the dominant brand in the multicultural space but will be going headtohead with the likes of procter  gamble and l’oréal and then the next battle beginsadvertisementrelated storiesideascrispr pioneer
