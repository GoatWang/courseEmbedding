splinter cell by tom clancy david michaels berkley isbn  chapter one its like being in a state of nonexistence a vacuum darkness and light at the same time and no sense of gravity theres no air but i know im breathing certainly no sounds are present i see and feel nothing there are no dreams thats what sleep is like for me im blessed i suppose i can will myself to sleep anywhere anytime i didnt train to do it its always been that way ever since i was a kid i simply tell myself its time to sleep now and i do it im sure a lot of people in the world would envy this talent i dont take it for granted because in my business i have to catch sleep in the strangest places and at the oddest times i feel the pulsating pressure on my wrist it gently pulls me out of this dimensionless world and i slowly regain the use of my senses i feel the warm metal against my face i hear faroff nondescript echoes the opsat attached to my wrist continues to wake me theres a little tshaped rod that protrudes from the flexible band when the silent alarm goes off the rod rocks back and forth nudging my pulse telling my body that its time to rouse when i first saw it demonstrated it reminded me of a james coburn spy movie from the sixties in which he played a secret agent who could stop his heart on command this apparently put him in some kind of hibernation he had a wristwatch with the same kind of tshaped rod that poked himuntil he woke up i remember laughing in the movie theater when i saw that it was too ridiculous to take seriously now look at me i take a few deep breaths the air is stale and dry inside the ventilation shaft where i spent the last six hours i flex my hands to get the blood circulating once again i stretch my feet even though theyre enclosed snugly in my boots then i open my eyes theres no more light in the shaft than there was when i first climbed into it the opsat finishes its duty and the little tshaped rod retracts i bring my left hand to my face and press the button to illuminate the opsats screen there are no new messages from lambert no incoming email alls quiet in the world the opsat is a handy little device that third echelon dreamed up for its agents its really called an operational satellite uplink primarily a tool for communication it has many other uses as well i particularly like the camera capabilities that allow me to snap digital pics of anything i want im suddenly aware of how hot it is and i remember where i am the ventilation shaft of the tropical casino in macau im lying horizontally in a space slightly smaller than a phone booth its a good thing im not claustrophobic or id be a basket case by now since i had to wait for the right time to make my move i set the alarm to wake me at four in the morning i figured thats when activity inside the casino would be at its most muted its a twentyfourhour joint so theres always going to be someone here im sweating like a pig inside my custommade uniform i forgot to adjust the temperature control before going to sleep i quickly turn the knob at my belt to make it cooler immediately i can feel the cold water flowing through the vessels embedded within the uniforms lining the military calls it an objective force warrior uniform its like an astronauts suit only sleeker and tighter i can make it cold or hot depending on what kind of environment im in its made of a heavy material with kevlar sewn into it yet its flexible enough for me to perform any gymnastic feat i wish to attempt i wouldnt call it bulletproof but its close the tough outer hide feels like elephant skin to the touch and it goes a long way toward deflecting stuff i suppose if i were shot at point blank id be dead but bullets fired from a range of fifteen feet or more might penetrate the suit but not me the kevlar acts as a braking mechanism pretty cool stuff another interesting feature is that its got photosensitive threading that reacts when a targeting laser strikes the material the suit sends a signal to my opsat alerting me that im in a snipers gun sight my only beef with the uniform is that its so tight fitting and neat that it makes me look like a comic book superhero even my special headpiece looks like a mask when i have the goggles down i pull the straw from the tube in the collar and suck refreshing cold water from the supply stored in the bladders distributed evenly throughout the suit theres enough water in there to last twelve hours as long as i use it sparingly its an odd concept but i have to fill up my uniform every so often time for a little energy i raise my body enough so i can reach into the osprey strapped to my back and pull out a ration the food in those things tastes a lot like the mres the army gets so theres a variety of stufffrom cajunstyle rice and beans to spaghetti to grilled chicken breast maybe some of that stuff is actually in the recipes the one i happen to pick resembles trail mix as i munch on the delicacy i recall how i got here and what the hell im supposed to be doing i had entered the casino during the early evening just as the big crowds were beginning to populate the place i wore street clothes and figured id be less noticeable when a lot of people were here casinos in macau are different from other ones around the world the chinese take their gambling very seriously theres never any shouting of jackpot much less any hint of smiles from these people they look as if theyd just as soon shoot you as deal you a card its par for the course i guess triads hang out in macau casinos and ive never seen a cheerful triad given the fact that since  macau was no longer a portuguese colony and was now one of the special administrative regions of china i could imagine that the inhabitants were not very happy like hong kong macau was now part of communist china even though the chinese government promised that things would remain relatively the same for the next fifty years it was still unclear what the colonys underworld was doing about the handover during the twentieth century macau had developed a reputation as a hotbed of spies vice and intrigue i played a few games lost a little money gained some of it back and then went to the washroom across from the broom closet i needed i had memorized the building plans before the mission commenced i could make my way around the casino blindfolded if i had to i slipped out of the washroom when i sensed no one was in the hallway and moved to the broom closet door i had to use a lock pick to open it luckily it wasnt a hightech lock after all it really was just a broom closet once i was inside i locked the door and proceeded to remove the street clothes revealing my funky superhero uniform underneath i folded the clothes and tucked them neatly in the osprey backpack i donned the headpiece and was set to go the change from clark kent to superman had taken me about forty seconds i climbed a tool shelf to reach the ventilation shaft opening gently pried off the grill cover and hung it on a nail on the wall i tested the strength of the structure to make sure it would hold my weight and then pulled myself in i could just barely turn myself around to reach out grab the grill cover and fasten it back on the shaft from the inside i did another aboutface and crawled silently through the shaft until i came to a spot that was sufficient for a nap and here i am i finish my meal and eat the digestible wrapper so i wont leave any trace of my being here i doubt anyone is going to look inside the ventilation shaft but one never knows time to act i crawl farther along the shaft make the left turn i know is coming go about twenty yards hook a right and then shimmy down a vertical drop for ten feet on the next level the shaft goes in three directions i tap the opsat for the compass mode just to confirm that the tunnel on my left is the westerly direction and then i crawl that way one more right turn and i can see the grill at the end of the shaft the casino presidents office i peer through the grill to make sure the office is dark and uninhabited i carefully push the grill off but hold on to it i dont want a loud clang when i drop it i worm my upper body out of the shaft and gently place the grill behind a sofa directly beneath me i then clutch the bottom of the shaft opening roll my lower back and hips out and somersault onto the carpeted floor so far so good i push the goggles over my eyes and switch on the nightvision mode no need to turn on any lights and attract attention being quiet and invisible are the two main rules in my profession get the job done without being seen or noticed if im caught the us government will deny any knowledge of my existence id be on my own in the hands of a foreign agency with no legal recourse or means of escape except with what i can manage to achieve with my body and mind its a test i dont particularly want to take even though ive studied for it for years there are always trick questions in that kind of test i go straight for the computer on the presidents expansive mahogany desk power it up and tap my fingers impatiently while i wait for the system to load when it asks for the password i type in the one that carly assured me would workand sure enough it does carly st john is a wizard when it comes to technical shit she can hack into any system anywhere and she can do it from her desk in washington dc using the search function i quickly find the folders i want they contain files of payoff records to various organizations and individuals i have to make sure these are separate from the legitimate casino expenses and carly has briefed me on how to tell the difference once again the telltale flags she mentioned are there so i know im in the right place i unzip the pouch on my left leg calf and remove a link that i insert into the computers floppy drive the other end i plug into my opsat a touch of a few buttons and voilàthe files begin to copy onto my portable device it takes only a minute or so as the opsat does its work i think about dan lee the third echelon man who was murdered in this casino three months ago he was tracking illegal arms sales in china and the trail led him here to macau the shop of course are the guys doing the dealing before he was killed lee had given lambert proof that the tropical casinos accounting department was being used as a front for the illegal transactions shutting down the shop is one of our primary directives and the only way to do it is to work from the outer ends of the pipelines back to the source and there are lots of pipelines all over the globe uncovering them is only half the battle now with these files listing the shops customers in our possession other us agencies can act on closing this particular pipeline we still dont know exactly what happened to dan lee a chinese recruit lee had worked for the nsa for something like seven years i never knew him personallywe never meet the other agents in third echelonbut i understand he was a standup guy he did his job well and was a good man lambert thought that someone in the shop had learned of his identity and lured him to the casino with information as bait lee never left the casino the opsat finishes the transfer just as i hear noise in the hallway outside shit i pull the link out of the computer keys rattle in the door and i hear a voice followed by a laugh there are two of them i have no time to shut down the computer but i hit the monitors off button i leap away from the desk and eye the distance to the ventilation shaft the key turns in the lock theres no time for that route i scamper up a set of filing cabinets and press myself into the corner my head against the ceiling its a difficult position to hold i have to use my knee against the top of the filing cabinets to leverage myself while at the same time pushing with my arms on the two walls to anchor my body it isnt comfortable just as i settle myself the door opens maybe they wont notice me since im some four or five feet above their heads i recognize the first guy the one with the keys its kim wei lo probably the mastermind behind the shops operation in macau hes on the wanted lists for all the threeletter agenciesyou know the cia the fbi the nsa  when the other guy turns slightly i make him too hes chen wong los bodyguard wong is a big guy but ive seen bigger if it came down to a faceoff im pretty sure i could take him lo hits one of the two light switches on the wall by the door the fluorescents directly over the desk blink on thank god he didnt switch on the other one my side of the room wouldve been showered with illumination at least im still in the shadows if they look up and focus on the back wall corner and ceiling theyll see me hanging there like a spider the two men go to the desk and lo says something in chinese i catch the word computer so i figure hes wondering why someone didnt shut it down for the night it doesnt bother him too much though he sits at the desk and begins to work while wong paces slowly behind him gazing out the large glass window that overlooks the main drag cutting through this poor excuse for a city an urban area is a more appropriate term as its the middle of the night there isnt much traffic or neon lights i hope something will mesmerize him enough that hell keep his back to me while i wait this out as a precaution though i mentally practice drawing my fiveseven from where i am but ultimately i dont think its possible without falling to the floor i have a directive not to kill anyone if i dont have to unfortunately ive had to disobey that directive on numerous occasions i dont like doing it but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do its hot in the room they must shut off the ac at night or maybe its a ruse to get gamblers to buy more drinks im dying to adjust the temperature in my uniform but i dont dare move i can feel the sweat building underneath my headpiece and its starting to trickle down my face shit wong turns and walks aimlessly around the desk and heads my way hes drawn his own pistolit looks like a smith  wesson  from hereand hes twirling it in his hand westernstyle he does an abrupt turn and faces a bookshelf as he continues to twirl the gun wong scans the titles of the books i guess the guy really can read lo says something and wong grunts in reply he doesnt walk back to the desk though damn it instead he moves away from the books and starts ambling toward the filing cabinets all he has to do is glance up and hell see me for sure continues
