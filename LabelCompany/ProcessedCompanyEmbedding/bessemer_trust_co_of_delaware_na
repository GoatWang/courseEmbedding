decedent s car was propelled into a nearby canal and was submerged by the time police arrived the decedent was found dead inside the cause of death was drowning goodman who allegedly made no effort to rescue the decedent or to contact authorities was treated at a nearby hospital for minor injuries and released these allegations have resulted in the florida action being a highlypublicized wrongful death action the wilsons are seeking punitive damages among other forms of relief comments their counsel has made to the media accusing goodman of hiding his assets and claiming that he has free use of the  trusts suggest that the wilsons will try to invade those trusts indeed the wilsons have sought and apparently obtained at least some discovery in the florida action regarding the  trusts and the balances in them  goodman family completes sale of hvac business all business jan   httpwwwallbusinesscomconstructionspecialtytradecontractorshtml bessemer s mot for rule to show cause  mot for rtsc  di  ¶   id  see eg jane musgrave attorneys battle over polo club founders level of wealth the palm beach post aug   httpwwworlandosentinelcomnewslocalpbgoodmanmotionhearingstory last visited sept    goodman objected to the wilsons discovery requests and the florida court heard argument on his objection on november   in an order dated november   the florida order  the florida court largely sustained goodman s objection but required him to produce a redacted version of the  trust agreement the florida order states in relevant part the value of assets of mr goodman s family members cannot be included in mr goodman s net worth for consideration by the jury unless mr goodman has a right to obtain those assets     an irrevocable trust over which mr goodman has no rights has no bearing on the net worth of mr goodman on december  and   the wilsons served subpoenas for depositions duces tecum on two bessemer employees the principal and senior resident officer of bessemer george w kern v and the former relationship manager of the palm beach office of bessemer trust company of florida david dary this discovery further demonstrates the wilsons interest in the  trusts the florida court conducted another hearing on january   after the wilsons requested the production of additional financial documents purportedly related to the net worth and financial resources of goodman in a ruling issued on february   circuit court judge glenn d kelley summarized the parties positions as follows the gravamen of the wilsons  position is that mr goodman must be worth more than his personal financial records show and that he is part of a goodman family enterprise that is adept at hiding assets the plaintiffs primary support for this assertion comes from  mr  compl ¶   goodman s spending habits over the past  years  the reported sale of goodman global holdings in  for more than a billion dollars and  the allegedly unexplained ownership of property by the trust established for the benefit of mr goodman s children mr goodman s response through counsel is that there is no mystery to his current financial status or to the distribution of his share of goodman global holdings he admits to spending more than he makes indeed rather than support the plaintiffs suspicions mr goodman points to his spending together with a divorce and a bad economy for his declining net worth  finally as to the children s trust mr goodman asserts that the trust s assets are managed independently and that any transactions with the trust are armslength mr goodman also maintains that the trust instrument itself is clear and does not grant him rights with respect to the trust s assets or with respect to the control of the trust judge kelley further stated that it is unlikely that any of the trust s assets can be considered by a jury in determining the net worth of mr goodman at least based on the clear wording of the agreement mr goodman maintains no control over the trust and has no interest in the corpus or income of the trust the trust is also clearly irrevocable nevertheless the florida court allowed limited discovery of the  trusts including tax returns balance sheets and income statements going back seven years noting that the use of trust assets by mr goodman together with the interrelated business  guardian ad litem s mot regarding guardian s authorization di  ex  at   id at   transactions between the trust and mr goodman are enough to invoke the lower standard of relevance applicable to discovery  thereafter the wilsons served another subpoena duces tecum for the deposition of a bessemer florida employee brandon reid for march   on march  the wilsons filed an amended renotice for reid s deposition requesting additional documents that bessemer contends contain confidential information related to the  trusts and exceed the scope of the february   florida order  while these discovery disputes were being litigated in florida master ayvazian appointed mr goddess as guardian ad litem for the  trust beneficiaries on february   in addition the master entered a stipulated order confirming bessemer s appointment as trustee of the  trusts and accepting jurisdiction over those trusts c procedural history bessemer initiated this second delaware action on january   seeking a declaratory judgment under  del c §  that the  trusts are irrevocable that goodman is not a beneficiary and that the wilsons are not entitled to discover confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts in its complaint bessemer also requested that the subpoenas issued by the wilsons to kern and dary either be declared defective and unenforceable or be quashed to protect the  id at   mot for rtsc ¶   trusts confidential information alternatively bessemer requested that a protective order be entered precluding or restricting the requested discovery based on undue burden and expense on march   goodman responded to bessemer s complaint and admitted that the  trusts are irrevocable and he is not a beneficiary goodman also supported bessemer s assertion that the wilsons are not entitled to discover confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts as defendants the wilsons were served with a summons and the complaint in february  but have not yet filed a response on april   bessemer moved for a rule to show cause directed to the wilsons as to why a default judgment should not be entered in bessemer s favor in particular bessemer sought entry of a judgment  reaffirming this court s jurisdiction over the  trusts  declaring those trusts irrevocable  declaring that goodman is not a beneficiary of the  trusts and  declaring that the wilsons are not entitled to discovery of confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts on april  the master issued the master s report in which she decided sua sponte to stay this second delaware action pending the decision of the florida court in the florida action the master based her decision on the mcwane doctrine which allows a delaware court to stay an action when there is a prior action pending  mcwane cast iron pipe corp v mcdowellwellman eng g co  ad  del   elsewhere in a court capable of doing prompt and complete justice involving the same parties and the same issues      the master reasoned that  the florida action was initiated six months before this action  the florida court is capable of providing prompt and complete justice as evidenced by the fact that it already had had two hearings each followed by a written decision  the parties in the florida action are substantially the same as the parties in the second delaware action in that goodman s interests appear to be aligned with those of bessemer in resisting discovery of confidential financial information of the  trusts and  the issues presented in the delaware action are the same or substantially the same as those presented in the florida action the master therefore concluded that the mcwane doctrine applied and that a stay of proceedings in delaware would avoid a wasteful duplication of time effort and expense and the possibility of inconsistent and conflicting rulings and judgments and an unseemly race by each party to trial and judgment in the forum of its choice  bessemer and goodman timely filed notices of exceptions to the master s report on april   and april   respectively goddess as guardian ad litem moved to intervene on april  and i later granted that motion in support of its exceptions to the stay bessemer argues that the master exceeded her authority in staying  id at  citrin hldgs llc v cullen  wl  at  del ch jan   quotation and footnote omitted see also in re advanced drivers educ prods  training inc  wl  at  del ch aug    master s report at  quoting mcwane  ad at  internal citations omitted  the action sua sponte pending resolution of the florida action erred in her application of the mcwane doctrine and improperly denied bessemer its choice of forum during a teleconference with the court on may   bessemer withdrew the fourth issue in its motion for rule to show cause which sought a declaration that the wilsons are not entitled to discovery of confidential financial information from bessemer regarding the  trusts bessemer confirmed its withdrawal of that aspect of its motion at oral argument on june   and again by letter that same day accordingly the only issues remaining before me are whether to lift the stay and to order a rule to show cause as to why this court should not reaffirm its jurisdiction over the  trusts declare the trusts irrevocable and declare that goodman is not a beneficiary of the trusts in accordance with court of chancery rule  i have reviewed de novo the evidence and arguments presented with respect to the issues decided in the master s report for the reasons stated in this memorandum opinion i am vacating the stay and entering the requested rule to show cause ii analysis the standard of review in this court as to a master s findings of facts and conclusions of law is de novo under rule  in reviewing the master s report i have considered the pleadings and other papers filed by bessemer goodman and goddess in  goodman and goddess on behalf of the beneficiaries have joined in bessemer s request that the stay be lifted and in the legal arguments it asserted in support of its exceptions to the master s report  this action i also have reviewed a number of documents filed in the first delaware action and the florida action a actual case or controversy as a threshold matter i raise sua sponte the question of whether there is an actual case or controversy here sufficient to support the issuance of a declaratory judgment absent a convincing argument by the wilsons to the contrary i am satisfied that bessemer has demonstrated the existence of an actual case or controversy and that granting the relief bessemer seeks will not amount to rendering an advisory opinion an actual case or controversy is a dispute  that involves the rights or other legal relations of the party seeking the declaratory relief  in which the claim of right or other legal interest is asserted against one who has an interest in contesting the claim  between parties whose interests are real and adverse and  where the issue involved is ripe for determination the first two of those elements plainly are met here bessemer as a delaware trustee is obligated to protect the rights and interests associated with the  trusts for which it is responsible and the wilsons against whom this claim has been filed have manifested an interest in attempting to invade those trusts by for example their efforts to include the  trusts in goodman s assets for the purpose of determining punitive damages in the florida action in addition the parties interests appear to be real and adverse as evidenced by the wilsons discovery requests in the florida action directed toward the  trusts  rollins int l inc v int l hydronics corp  ad   del   goodman s own net worth reportedly is around  million if the wilsons succeed in including the value of the  trusts in goodman s assets for the purpose of determining punitive damages in the florida action such damages foreseeably could exceed goodman s net worth and leave the  trusts susceptible to an action to invade them in connection with the wilsons efforts to enforce any resulting judgment bessemer clearly has a real interest in opposing the wilsons efforts in that regard a declaration by this court as to the nature of the trusts presumably will help clarify this issue and benefit the florida action fourth the fairly limited requests in bessemer s revised motion for rule to show cause are sufficiently ripe for review by this court the standard for ripeness is one of common sense and includes a practical evaluation of the legitimate interest of the plaintiff in a prompt resolution of the question presented and the hardship that further delay may threaten      this court also may consider among other things whether factual developments in the future might affect the determination to be made bessemer has a legitimate interest as the trustee of the  trusts in protecting the interests of those trusts and the beneficiaries of them the ongoing litigation in florida threatens to encroach upon the interests of the trusts and their beneficiaries the exigency of bessemer s concern is evidenced by the wilsons persistent efforts to discover confidential information regarding the  trusts in the florida action the  schick inc v amalgamated clothing  textile workers union  ad   del ch   id  pending motion as revised no longer seeks to limit or restrict such discovery in any way therefore some of the concerns that motivated the stay ordered by the master have been alleviated by contrast a delay in providing relief in this action could deny bessemer its choice of forum and deprive the florida court of useful information regarding issues likely to come before it if only indirectly regarding the  trusts furthermore the facts relevant to making a determination as to the issues now before me have been long established are not dependent on any pending decisions of the florida court and are not otherwise likely to change for all of these reasons i hold that bessemer s claims for relief present an actual case or controversy sufficient to support a justiciable claim for relief under the delaware declaratory judgment act b mcwane doctrine the master relied on the mcwane doctrine in ordering a stay under mcwane a court may exercise its discretion freely to stay an action when there is a prior action pending elsewhere in a court capable of doing prompt and complete justice involving the same parties and the same issues      although the mcwane doctrine may have supported staying this action in favor of the florida action when the master issued her report i conclude that a stay is no longer warranted based on the changed circumstances   del c §§   mcwane cast iron pipe corp v mcdowellwellman eng g co  ad   del   currently before me a major aspect of the relief originally sought by bessemer here was a declaratory judgment that the wilsons are not entitled to discover confidential information from bessemer concerning the  trusts the overlap between that aspect of the relief sought in this second delaware action and certain issues that actively were being litigated in the florida action appear to have figured prominently in the master s decision to stay this action in favor of the florida action since the filing of the master s report however bessemer has withdrawn its request for an order precluding or restricting discovery being sought as to the  trusts in connection with the florida action thus that justification for the stay is now moot the question before me therefore is whether this court should continue the stay imposed by the master as to bessemer s remaining claims which seek a declaratory judgment a reaffiming the jurisdiction of this court over the  trusts b declaring that the  trusts are irrevocable and c declaring that john b goodman is not a beneficiary of the  trusts  as to that question i conclude that the stay should be lifted and the requested rule to show cause should issue and be served on the wilsons because bessemer has  having reached this conclusion i need not dilate on bessemer s threshold argument that the master exceeded her authority in staying this action sua sponte i merely note without deciding that the court s referral of a matter to a master likely includes at least implicitly the authority to manage the proceedings before her as the master deems appropriate as occurred in this case any party who objects to the master s exercise of her discretion in that regard may seek review by the court  bessemer s revised proposed form of order for rule to show cause di  at   narrowed significantly the scope of relief that it seeks the mcwane doctrine no longer supports a stay first the parties in the florida action and this action are not the same plaintiff bessemer is not a party in the florida action and several parties named in that action such as the palm beach international polo club and the player s club restaurant are not parties in this case second the issues in the florida action and in this action are not the same the main issue here is whether goodman has a beneficial interest in the  trusts that were established for the benefit of his children by contrast the main issue before the florida court is whether goodman is liable for the death of the decedent and if so the amount of damages for which he is liable the florida court is not in a position to bind bessemer for example in terms of the declaratory relief bessemer seeks here regarding this court s jurisdiction the irrevocable nature of the  trusts and whether goodman is a beneficiary of those trusts accordingly i conclude that the mcwane doctrine does not justify maintaining a stay of this second delaware action pending resolution of the florida action furthermore as to bessemer s motion for entry of a rule to show cause there is no good reason to delay further proceedings to address the narrowly focused relief sought by  i also note however that bessemer s motion does not seek a declaration that for example the  trusts are not exposed to the tort creditors of goodman or that the trusts assets are or are not within goodman s control to this court s knowledge no such issues are ripe for decision at this time if in the future those or other issues pertaining to a potential effort to invade the  trusts to collect on a judgment against goodman become ripe and are brought before this court i would expect in the interests of judicial economy and expedition to address those issues promptly and directly without referring them to a master for an initial determination  that motion issuing the requested rule to show cause will give the wilsons an opportunity to present their arguments as to why i should not grant bessemer s proposed declaratory judgments if they do not object or elect not to appear such declarations may help to inform the proceedings in the florida action and to reduce the number of collateral issues requiring adjudication in the future iii conclusion for the foregoing reasons i hereby vacate the order staying this action and will proceed to enter a rule to show cause consistent with this memorandum opinion directing the wilsons to appear before this court within thirty  days and to show why the court should not grant the relief sought in bessemer s motion it is so ordered  search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google

esq  rosenthal monhait  goddess pa wilmington delaware guardian ad litem nominal defendant intervenor memorandum opinion parsons vice chancellor on february   john b goodman allegedly ran through a stop sign resulting in the death of scott patrick wilson the decedent a recent college graduate the decedents parents lili m wilson and william a wilson jr the wilsons brought a wrongful death action against goodman in the circuit court of the th judicial circuit in and for palm beach county florida the florida court on july   the florida action as part of that dispute the wilsons have sought to discover information regarding two trusts collectively known as the jbg childrens  trust the  trusts that goodman and his exwife isla reckling goodman carroll goodman created on april   for the benefit of their children harriet and john jr the beneficiaries bessemer trust company of delaware na bessemer was declared trustee of the  trusts on february   in a separate action before this court the first delaware action bessemer filed this present action on january   the second delaware action seeking to confirm that goodman has no beneficial interest in the  trusts and that therefore the wilsons should not be permitted to depose bessemer employees in delaware or florida or otherwise obtain records of or confidential information about those trusts on february   the florida court issued an order requiring goodman to produce certain documents regarding the  trusts the wilsons rescinded their notice of deposition to the bessemer employee in delaware on february  presumably to avoid the jurisdiction of this court but proceeded to depose two former bessemer employees in florida on february  and march   on april  bessemer filed a motion and proposed order for a rule to show cause in this action that would direct the wilsons to appear before this court and state why it should not enter a declaratory judgment indicating that  this court continues to accept jurisdiction over the  trusts  the  trusts are irrevocable  goodman is not a beneficiary of the  trusts and  the wilsons are not entitled to discovery of confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts on april   master in chancery kim ayvazian issued a final report and order the masters report staying the proceedings in this court in favor of the florida action pending a decision by the florida court on the discovery issue before it bessemer timely filed exceptions to the masters report i carefully have reviewed de novo the pleadings and other submissions in this case i also have held a telephone conference with and heard oral argument by counsel for the plaintiff bessemer the nominal defendant goodman and the guardian ad litem for the beneficiaries jeffrey s goddess esq the wilsons have not filed any papers in this action or formally participated in any of the proceedings to date after the argument bessemer voluntarily deleted its fourth request for declaratory relief which pertained to discovery and revised its proposed order for a rule to show cause to narrow its scope to encompass only its request for declaratory judgments as to the first three issues identified above based on these developments and for the reasons discussed in this memorandum opinion i conclude that the stay should be lifted and the revised rule to show cause should issue i factual background a the parties plaintiff bessemer is the successor trustee of the  trusts as confirmed in the first delaware action defendants the wilsons are the parents of the decedent and copersonal representatives of their sons estate the wilson estate they are the plaintiffs in the florida action nominal defendant goodman and his exwife carroll goodman are the trustors of the  trusts goodman is a defendant in the florida action nominal defendant goddess is an attorney at rosenthal monhait  goddess pa he was appointed guardian ad litem to the beneficiaries of the  trusts by master ayvazian in the first delaware action b the facts the  trusts were created in texas by goodman and carroll goodman collectively the trustors by agreement the  trust agreement on april   for the benefit of their future children the present beneficiaries of the trusts are the trustors two children harriett goodman harriett born july   and john b goodman jr john jr born on july   the  trust agreement states that goodman has no beneficial rights in the  trusts that no distribution shall be made to the trustors and that the  trusts are irrevocable the  trust agreement provides for separate trusts for each child each trust contains a total of about  million about  million in marketable securities and another approximately  million in alternativetype investments bessemer was appointed trustee of the  trusts on may   as confirmed by the master in the first delaware action goodman and carroll goodman agreed by letter dated july   that the trusts would be subject to the jurisdiction of the delaware court of chancery and that thereafter delaware law would govern the administration of the trusts goodman reportedly has personal assets of approximately  million goodmans father harold v goodman founded goodman manufacturing company in  goodman manufacturing allegedly is now the second largest manufacturer of air conditioning and heating equipment in the united states in  the goodman family sold goodman manufacturing for an estimated  billion dollars the  trusts as well as various other goodman family trusts received a portion of the sales proceeds in the florida action the wilsons allege that on february   goodman was driving under the influence ran a stop sign and crashed into a car driven by the yearold decedent the decedents car was propelled into a nearby canal and was submerged by the time police arrived the decedent was found dead inside the cause of death was drowning goodman who allegedly made no effort to rescue the decedent or to contact authorities was treated at a nearby hospital for minor injuries and released these allegations have resulted in the florida action being a highlypublicized wrongful death action the wilsons are seeking punitive damages among other forms of relief comments their counsel has made to the media accusing goodman of hiding his assets and claiming that he has free use of the  trusts suggest that the wilsons will try to invade those trusts indeed the wilsons have sought and apparently obtained at least some discovery in the florida action regarding the  trusts and the balances in them goodman objected to the wilsons discovery requests and the florida court heard argument on his objection on november   in an order dated november   the florida order the florida court largely sustained goodmans objection but required him to produce a redacted version of the  trust agreement the florida order states in relevant part the value of assets of mr goodmans family members cannot be included in mr goodmans net worth for consideration by the jury unless mr goodman has a right to obtain those assets     an irrevocable trust over which mr goodman has no rights has no bearing on the net worth of mr goodman on december  and   the wilsons served subpoenas for depositions duces tecum on two bessemer employees—the principal and senior resident officer of bessemer george w kern v and the former relationship manager of the palm beach office of bessemer trust company of florida david dary this discovery further demonstrates the wilsons interest in the  trusts the florida court conducted another hearing on january   after the wilsons requested the production of additional financial documents purportedly related to the net worth and financial resources of goodman in a ruling issued on february   circuit court judge glenn d kelley summarized the parties positions as follows the gravamen of the wilsons position is that mr goodman must be worth more than his personal financial records show and that he is part of a goodman family enterprise that is adept at hiding assets the plaintiffs primary support for this assertion comes from  mr goodmans spending habits over the past  years  the reported sale of goodman global holdings in  for more than a billion dollars and  the allegedly unexplained ownership of property by the trust established for the benefit of mr goodmans children mr goodmans response through counsel is that there is no mystery to his current financial status or to the distribution of his share of goodman global holdings he admits to spending more than he makes indeed rather than support the plaintiffs suspicions mr goodman points to his spending — together with a divorce and a bad economy — for his declining net worth     finally as to the childrens trust mr goodman asserts that the trusts assets are managed independently and that any transactions with the trust are armslength mr goodman also maintains that the trust instrument itself is clear and does not grant him rights with respect to the trusts assets or with respect to the control of the trust judge kelley further stated that it is unlikely that any of the trusts assets can be considered by a jury in determining the net worth of mr goodman at least based on the clear wording of the agreement mr goodman maintains no control over the trust and has no interest in the corpus or income of the trust the trust is also clearly irrevocable nevertheless the florida court allowed limited discovery of the  trusts including tax returns balance sheets and income statements going back seven years noting that the use of trust assets by mr goodman together with the interrelated business transactions between the trust and mr goodman are enough to invoke the lower standard of relevance applicable to discovery thereafter the wilsons served another subpoena duces tecum for the deposition of a bessemer florida employee brandon reid for march   on march  the wilsons filed an amended renotice for reids deposition requesting additional documents that bessemer contends contain confidential information related to the  trusts and exceed the scope of the february   florida order while these discovery disputes were being litigated in florida master ayvazian appointed mr goddess as guardian ad litem for the  trust beneficiaries on february   in addition the master entered a stipulated order confirming bessemers appointment as trustee of the  trusts and accepting jurisdiction over those trusts c procedural history bessemer initiated this second delaware action on january   seeking a declaratory judgment under  del c §  that the  trusts are irrevocable that goodman is not a beneficiary and that the wilsons are not entitled to discover confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts in its complaint bessemer also requested that the subpoenas issued by the wilsons to kern and dary either be declared defective and unenforceable or be quashed to protect the trusts confidential information alternatively bessemer requested that a protective order be entered precluding or restricting the requested discovery based on undue burden and expense on march   goodman responded to bessemers complaint and admitted that the  trusts are irrevocable and he is not a beneficiary goodman also supported bessemers assertion that the wilsons are not entitled to discover confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts as defendants the wilsons were served with a summons and the complaint in february  but have not yet filed a response on april   bessemer moved for a rule to show cause directed to the wilsons as to why a default judgment should not be entered in bessemers favor in particular bessemer sought entry of a judgment  reaffirming this courts jurisdiction over the  trusts  declaring those trusts irrevocable  declaring that goodman is not a beneficiary of the  trusts and  declaring that the wilsons are not entitled to discovery of confidential financial information from bessemer concerning the  trusts on april  the master issued the masters report in which she decided sua sponte to stay this second delaware action pending the decision of the florida court in the florida action the master based her decision on the mcwane doctrine which allows a delaware court to stay an action when there is a prior action pending elsewhere in a court capable of doing prompt and complete justice involving the same parties and the same issues     the master reasoned that  the florida action was initiated six months before this action  the florida court is capable of providing prompt and complete justice as evidenced by the fact that it already had had two hearings each followed by a written decision  the parties in the florida action are substantially the same as the parties in the second delaware action in that goodmans interests appear to be aligned with those of bessemer in resisting discovery of confidential financial information of the  trusts and  the issues presented in the delaware action are the same or substantially the same as those presented in the florida action the master therefore concluded that the mcwane doctrine applied and that a stay of proceedings in delaware would avoid a wasteful duplication of time effort and expense and the possibility of inconsistent and conflicting rulings and judgments and an unseemly race by each party to trial and judgment in the forum of its choice bessemer and goodman timely filed notices of exceptions to the masters report on april   and april   respectively goddess as guardian ad litem moved to intervene on april  and i later granted that motion in support of its exceptions to the stay bessemer argues that the master exceeded her authority in staying the action sua sponte pending resolution of the florida action erred in her application of the mcwane doctrine and improperly denied bessemer its choice of forum during a teleconference with the court on may   bessemer withdrew the fourth issue in its motion for rule to show cause which sought a declaration that the wilsons are not entitled to discovery of confidential financial information from bessemer regarding the  trusts bessemer confirmed its withdrawal of that aspect of its motion at oral argument on june   and again by letter that same day accordingly the only issues remaining before me are whether to lift the stay and to order a rule to show cause as to why this court should not reaffirm its jurisdiction over the  trusts declare the trusts irrevocable and declare that goodman is not a beneficiary of the trusts in accordance with court of chancery rule  i have reviewed de novo the evidence and arguments presented with respect to the issues decided in the masters report for the reasons stated in this memorandum opinion i am vacating the stay and entering the requested rule to show cause ii analysis the standard of review in this court as to a masters findings of facts and conclusions of law is de novo under rule  in reviewing the masters report i have considered the pleadings and other papers filed by bessemer goodman and goddess in this action i also have reviewed a number of documents filed in the first delaware action and the florida action a actual case or controversy as a threshold matter i raise sua sponte the question of whether there is an actual case or controversy here sufficient to support the issuance of a declaratory judgment absent a convincing argument by the wilsons to the contrary i am satisfied that bessemer has demonstrated the existence of an actual case or controversy and that granting the relief bessemer seeks will not amount to rendering an advisory opinion an actual case or controversy is a dispute  that involves the rights or other legal relations of the party seeking the declaratory relief  in which the claim of right or other legal interest is asserted against one who has an interest in contesting the claim  between parties whose interests are real and adverse and  where the issue involved is ripe for determination the first two of those elements plainly are met here bessemer as a delaware trustee is obligated to protect the rights and interests associated with the  trusts for which it is responsible and the wilsons against whom this claim has been filed have manifested an interest in attempting to invade those trusts by for example their efforts to include the  trusts in goodmans assets for the purpose of determining punitive damages in the florida action in addition the parties interests appear to be real and adverse as evidenced by the wilsons discovery requests in the florida action directed toward the  trusts goodmans own net worth reportedly is around  million if the wilsons succeed in including the value of the  trusts in goodmans assets for the purpose of determining punitive damages in the florida action such damages foreseeably could exceed goodmans net worth and leave the  trusts susceptible to an action to invade them in connection with the wilsons efforts to enforce any resulting judgment bessemer clearly has a real interest in opposing the wilsons efforts in that regard a declaration by this court as to the nature of the trusts presumably will help clarify this issue and benefit the florida action fourth the fairly limited requests in bessemers revised motion for rule to show cause are sufficiently ripe for review by this court the standard for ripeness is one of common sense and includes a practical evaluation of the legitimate interest of the plaintiff in a prompt resolution of the question presented and the hardship that further delay may threaten     this court also may consider among other things whether factual developments in the future might affect the determination to be made bessemer has a legitimate interest as the trustee of the  trusts in protecting the interests of those trusts and the beneficiaries of them the ongoing litigation in florida threatens to encroach upon the interests of the trusts and their beneficiaries the exigency of bessemers concern is evidenced by the wilsons persistent efforts to discover confidential information regarding the  trusts in the florida action the pending motion as revised no longer seeks to limit or restrict such discovery in any way therefore some of the concerns that motivated the stay ordered by the master have been alleviated by contrast a delay in providing relief in this action could deny bessemer its choice of forum and deprive the florida court of useful information regarding issues likely to come before it if only indirectly regarding the  trusts furthermore the facts relevant to making a determination as to the issues now before me have been long established are not dependent on any pending decisions of the florida court and are not otherwise likely to change for all of these reasons i hold that bessemers claims for relief present an actual case or controversy sufficient to support a justiciable claim for relief under the delaware declaratory judgment act b mcwane doctrine the master relied on the mcwane doctrine in ordering a stay under mcwane a court may exercise its discretion freely to stay an action when there is a prior action pending elsewhere in a court capable of doing prompt and complete justice involving the same parties and the same issues     although the mcwane doctrine may have supported staying this action in favor of the florida action when the master issued her report i conclude that a stay is no longer warranted based on the changed circumstances currently before me a major aspect of the relief originally sought by bessemer here was a declaratory judgment that the wilsons are not entitled to discover confidential information from bessemer concerning the  trusts the overlap between that aspect of the relief sought in this second delaware action and certain issues that actively were being litigated in the florida action appear to have figured prominently in the masters decision to stay this action in favor of the florida action since the filing of the masters report however bessemer has withdrawn its request for an order precluding or restricting discovery being sought as to the  trusts in connection with the florida action thus that justification for the stay is now moot the question before me therefore is whether this court should continue the stay imposed by the master as to bessemers remaining claims which seek a declaratory judgment a reaffiming the jurisdiction of this court over the  trusts b declaring that the  trusts are irrevocable and c declaring that john b goodman is not a beneficiary of the  trusts as to that question i conclude that the stay should be lifted and the requested rule to show cause should issue and be served on the wilsons because bessemer has narrowed significantly the scope of relief that it seeks the mcwane doctrine no longer supports a stay first the parties in the florida action and this action are not the same plaintiff bessemer is not a party in the florida action and several parties named in that action such as the palm beach international polo club and the players club restaurant are not parties in this case second the issues in the florida action and in this action are not the same the main issue here is whether goodman has a beneficial interest in the  trusts that were established for the benefit of his children by contrast the main issue before the florida court is whether goodman is liable for the death of the decedent and if so the amount of damages for which he is liable the florida court is not in a position to bind bessemer for example in terms of the declaratory relief bessemer seeks here regarding this courts jurisdiction the irrevocable nature of the  trusts and whether goodman is a beneficiary of those trusts accordingly i conclude that the mcwane doctrine does not justify maintaining a stay of this second delaware action pending resolution of the florida action furthermore as to bessemers motion for entry of a rule to show cause there is no good reason to delay further proceedings to address the narrowly focused relief sought by that motion issuing the requested rule to show cause will give the wilsons an opportunity to present their arguments as to why i should not grant bessemers proposed declaratory judgments if they do not object or elect not to appear such declarations may help to inform the proceedings in the florida action and to reduce the number of collateral issues requiring adjudication in the future iii conclusion for the foregoing reasons i hereby vacate the order staying this action and will proceed to enter a rule to show cause consistent with this memorandum opinion directing the wilsons to appear before this court within thirty  days and to show why the court should not grant the relief sought in bessemers motion it

conclusion i need not dilate on bessemers threshold argument that the master exceeded her authority in staying this action sua sponte i merely note without deciding that the courts referral of a matter to a master likely includes at least implicitly the authority to manage the proceedings before her as the master deems appropriate as occurred in this case any party who objects to the masters exercise of her discretion in that regard may seek review by the court  bessemers revised proposed form of order for rule to show cause di  at   i also note however that bessemers motion does not seek a declaration that for example the  trusts are not exposed to the tort creditors of goodman or that the trusts assets are or are not within goodmans control to this courts knowledge no such issues are ripe for decision at this time if in the future those or other issues pertaining to a potential effort to invade the  trusts to collect on a judgment against goodman become ripe and are brought before this court i would expect in the interests of judicial economy and expedition to address those issues promptly and directly without referring them to a master for an initial determination comment your
