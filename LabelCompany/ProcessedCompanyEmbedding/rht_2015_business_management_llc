open source computer software provider red hat inc nyserht released fourthquarter earnings data for fiscal year  rht reported solid figures for the quarter beating analyst expectations as well as management’s guidance red hat is up solidly today but if you’re not yet in rht stock don’t worry the party is far from over rht fourthquarter results quarterly revenue of  million was up  yearoveryear and beat both analyst expectations of  million and management’s guidance of  million million more than  of rht’s revenue came from subscriptions and that  million portion was  higher than subscription revenue in q  net income for the quarter came in at  million or  cents per share up from  cents in the yearago quarter fullyear earnings also were up  cents to  cents google watch will slaughter apple watch aside from solid revenue and earnings figures rht announced the approval of a  million stock repurchase plan which will replace the  million plan that expired the same day according to the company’s press release rht has repurchased more than  billion  million shares over the past four years what this means for red hat stock all things considered yesterday’s report simply reinforces the fact that red hat stock still is a solid buy — even after thursday’s gains the company’s opensource cloud infrastructure easily stands toetotoe with closed systems such as amazoncom inc’s nasdaqamzn aws and microsoft corporation’s nasdaqmsft azure platform despite rht being only a fraction of the size of amzn and msft it’s got quite a bit going for it that should turn into industryleading profit and growth this year one of the most inspiring and exciting things about red hat has been the ongoing development and evolution of the openstack platform openstack is free opensource cloud computing technology that began in  and has since become the focus of a global push for hybrid cloud capabilities that are customizable scalable and — most importantly — secure red hat’s involvement in the project and massive contributions to its evolution demonstrate core fundamentals that place a high value on furthering technology to benefit the entire world even without direct compensation for me sharing important technological advancements that anyone can use — despite a lack of compensation — shows commendable qualities the fact that rht’s earnings and revenues have consistently been stable just validates my opinion that red hat has what it takes to survive in an increasingly cutthroat industry rht also is gaining ground on competitors by developing programs to assist businesses with their transition to cloudbased systems red hat’s new cloud innovation practice supports companies entering the cloud and obviously steers them toward rht solutions the support system would not have been possible without the acquisition of enovance an openstack cloud services provider acquired by red hat last year expertise at enovance will also allow rht to take larger steps forward in its innovation and development of the openstack platform which will ultimately result in an even easier time gaining new customers and competing with cloud computing big dogs amzn and msft final thoughts with continued focus on improving its suite of enterprise solutions and products particularly in the cloud computing arena red hat is poised to for another year of strong growth and net earnings existing partnerships with cisco systems inc nasdaqcsco hewlettpackard company nysehpq international business machines corp nyseibm dell and quru allow rht to cooperate with other industry giants to integrate products and software that together provide topquality it solutions for big businesses red hat’s president of products and technologies described rht’s approach and use of open source processes “the problems we need to solve today can’t be solved by one company” he said this methodology and cooperative mentality is responsible for making rht the world’s opensource leader and will continue as more partnerships are forged in the future utilizing its newly expanded team of cloud experts red hat has the tools it needs to make big moves this year and rht stock holders are sure to be rewarded as of this writing greg gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities can the market’s technical difficulties be overcome godaddy ipo price pegs gddy stock at

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
