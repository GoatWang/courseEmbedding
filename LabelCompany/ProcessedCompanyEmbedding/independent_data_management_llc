secondary   min to read contributors all azure sql database offers the following capabilities for recovering from an outage active georeplication georestore to learn about business continuity scenarios and the features supporting these scenarios see business continuity prepare for the event of an outage for success with recovery to another data region using either active georeplication or georedundant backups you need to prepare a server in another data center outage to become the new primary server should the need arise as well as have welldefined steps documented and tested to ensure a smooth recovery these preparation steps include identify the logical server in another region to become the new primary server with active georeplication this will be at least one and perhaps each of the secondary servers for georestore this will generally be a server in the paired region for the region in which your database is located identify and optionally define the serverlevel firewall rules needed on for users to access the new primary database determine how you are going to redirect users to the new primary server such as by changing connection strings or by changing dns entries identify and optionally create the logins that must be present in the master database on the new primary server and ensure these logins have appropriate permissions in the master database if any for more information see sql database security after disaster recovery identify alert rules that will need to be updated to map to the new primary database document the auditing configuration on the current primary database perform a disaster recovery drill to simulate an outage for georestore you can delete or rename the source database to cause application connectivity failure to simulate an outage for active georeplication you can disable the web application or virtual machine connected to the database or failover the database to cause application connectivity failures when to initiate recovery the recovery operation impacts the application it requires changing the sql connection string or redirection using dns and could result in permanent data loss therefore it should be done only when the outage is likely to last longer than your applications recovery time objective when the application is deployed to production you should perform regular monitoring of the application health and use the following data points to assert that the recovery is warranted permanent connectivity failure from the application tier to the database the azure portal shows an alert about an incident in the region with broad impact the azure sql database server is marked as degraded depending on your application tolerance to downtime and possible business liability you can consider the following recovery options use the get recoverable database lastavailablebackupdate to get the latest georeplicated restore point wait for service recovery the azure teams work diligently to restore service availability as quickly as possible but depending on the root cause it can take hours or days if your application can tolerate significant downtime you can simply wait for the recovery to complete in this case no action on your part is required you can see the current service status on our azure service health dashboard after the recovery of the region your application’s availability will be restored fail over to georeplicated secondary database if your application’s downtime can result in business liability you should be using georeplicated databases in your application it will enable the application to quickly restore availability in a different region in case of an outage learn how to configure georeplication to restore availability of the databases you need to initiate the failover to the georeplicated secondary using one of the supported methods use one of the following guides to fail over to a georeplicated secondary database fail over to a georeplicated secondary using azure portal fail over to a georeplicated secondary using powershell fail over to a georeplicated secondary using tsql recover using georestore if your application’s downtime does not result in business liability you can use georestore as a method to recover your application databases it creates a copy of the database from its latest georedundant backup configure your database after recovery if you are using either georeplication failover or georestore to recover from an outage you must make sure that the connectivity to the new databases is properly configured so that the normal application function can be resumed this is a checklist of tasks to get your recovered database production ready update connection strings because your recovered database will reside in a different server you need to update your application’s connection string to point to that server for more information about changing connection strings see the appropriate development language for your

a secondary   min to read contributors all azure sql database offers the following capabilities for recovering from an outage active georeplication georestore to learn about business continuity scenarios and the features supporting these scenarios see business continuity prepare for the event of an outage for success with recovery to another data region using either active georeplication or georedundant backups you need to prepare a server in another data center outage to become the new primary server should the need arise as well as have welldefined steps documented and tested to ensure a smooth recovery these preparation steps include identify the logical server in another region to become the new primary server with active georeplication this will be at least one and perhaps each of the secondary servers for georestore this will generally be a server in the paired region for the region in which your database is located identify and optionally define the serverlevel firewall rules needed on for users to access the new primary database determine how you are going to redirect users to the new primary server such as by changing connection strings or by changing dns entries identify and optionally create the logins that must be present in the master database on the new primary server and ensure these logins have appropriate permissions in the master database if any for more information see sql database security after disaster recovery identify alert rules that will need to be updated to map to the new primary database document the auditing configuration on the current primary database perform a disaster recovery drill to simulate an outage for georestore you can delete or rename the source database to cause application connectivity failure to simulate an outage for active georeplication you can disable the web application or virtual machine connected to the database or failover the database to cause application connectivity failures when to initiate recovery the recovery operation impacts the application it requires changing the sql connection string or redirection using dns and could result in permanent data loss therefore it should be done only when the outage is likely to last longer than your applications recovery time objective when the application is deployed to production you should perform regular monitoring of the application health and use the following data points to assert that the recovery is warranted permanent connectivity failure from the application tier to the database the azure portal shows an alert about an incident in the region with broad impact the azure sql database server is marked as degraded depending on your application tolerance to downtime and possible business liability you can consider the following recovery options use the get recoverable database lastavailablebackupdate to get the latest georeplicated restore point wait for service recovery the azure teams work diligently to restore service availability as quickly as possible but depending on the root cause it can take hours or days if your application can tolerate significant downtime you can simply wait for the recovery to complete in this case no action on your part is required you can see the current service status on our azure service health dashboard after the recovery of the region your application’s availability will be restored fail over to georeplicated secondary database if your application’s downtime can result in business liability you should be using georeplicated databases in your application it will enable the application to quickly restore availability in a different region in case of an outage learn how to configure georeplication to restore availability of the databases you need to initiate the failover to the georeplicated secondary using one of the supported methods use one of the following guides to fail over to a georeplicated secondary database fail over to a georeplicated secondary using azure portal fail over to a georeplicated secondary using powershell fail over to a georeplicated secondary using tsql recover using georestore if your application’s downtime does not result in business liability you can use georestore as a method to recover your application databases it creates a copy of the database from its latest georedundant backup configure your database after recovery if you are using either georeplication failover or georestore to recover from an outage you must make sure that the connectivity to the new databases is properly configured so that the normal application function can be resumed this is a checklist of tasks to get your recovered database production ready update connection strings because your recovered database will reside in a different server you need to update your application’s connection string to point to that server for more information about changing connection strings see the appropriate development language for your

api   min to read contributors azure cosmos db is microsofts globally distributed multimodel database service for missioncritical applications azure cosmos db provides turnkey global distribution elastic scaling of throughput and storage worldwide singledigit millisecond latencies at the th percentile five welldefined consistency levels and guaranteed high availability all backed by industryleading slas azure cosmos db automatically indexes data without requiring you to deal with schema and index management it is multimodel and supports document keyvalue graph and columnar data models with the documentdb api azure cosmos db provides rich and familiar sql query capabilities with consistent low latencies over schemaless json data in this article we provide an overview of the azure cosmos dbs documentdb api and how you can use it to store massive volumes of json data query them within order of milliseconds latency and evolve the schema easily what capabilities and key features does azure cosmos db offer azure cosmos db via the documentdb api offers the following key capabilities and benefits elastically scalable throughput and storage easily scale up or scale down your json database to meet your application needs your data is stored on solid state disks ssd for low predictable latencies azure cosmos db supports containers for storing json data called collections that can scale to virtually unlimited storage sizes and provisioned throughput you can elastically scale azure cosmos db with predictable performance seamlessly as your application grows multiregion replication azure cosmos db transparently replicates your data to all regions youve associated with your azure cosmos db account enabling you to develop applications that require global access to data while providing tradeoffs between consistency availability and performance all with corresponding guarantees azure cosmos db provides transparent regional failover with multihoming apis and the ability to elastically scale throughput and storage across the globe learn more in distribute data globally with azure cosmos db ad hoc queries with familiar sql syntax store heterogeneous json documents and query these documents through a familiar sql syntax azure cosmos db utilizes a highly concurrent lock free log structured indexing technology to automatically index all document content this enables rich realtime queries without the need to specify schema hints secondary indexes or views learn more in query azure cosmos db javascript execution within the database express application logic as stored procedures triggers and user defined functions udfs using standard javascript this allows your application logic to operate over data without worrying about the mismatch between the application and the database schema the documentdb api provides full transactional execution of javascript application logic directly inside the database engine the deep integration of javascript enables the execution of insert replace delete and select operations from within a javascript program as an isolated transaction learn more in documentdb serverside programming tunable consistency levels select from five well defined consistency levels to achieve optimal tradeoff between consistency and performance for queries and read operations azure cosmos db offers five distinct consistency levels strong boundedstaleness session consistent prefix and eventual these granular welldefined consistency levels allow you to make sound tradeoffs between consistency availability and latency learn more in using consistency levels to maximize availability and performance fully managed eliminate the need to manage database and machine resources as a fullymanaged microsoft azure service you do not need to manage virtual machines deploy and configure software manage scaling or deal with complex datatier upgrades every database is automatically backed up and protected against regional failures you can easily add an azure cosmos db account and provision capacity as you need it allowing you to focus on your application instead of operating and managing your database open by design get started quickly by using existing skills and tools programming against the documentdb api is simple approachable and does not require you to adopt new tools or adhere to custom extensions to json or javascript you can access all of the database functionality including crud query and javascript processing over a simple restful http interface the documentdb api embraces existing formats languages and standards while offering high value database capabilities on top of them automatic indexing by default azure cosmos db automatically indexes all the documents in the database and does not expect or require any schema or creation of secondary indices dont want to index everything dont worry you can opt out of paths in your json files too how do you manage data with the documentdb api the documentdb api helps manages json data through welldefined database resources these resources are replicated for high availability and are uniquely addressable by their logical uri the documentdb api offers a simple http based restful programming model for all resources the azure cosmos db database account is a unique namespace that gives you access to azure cosmos db before you can create a database account you must have an azure subscription which gives you access to a variety of azure services all resources within azure cosmos db are modeled and stored as json documents resources are managed as items which are json documents containing metadata and as feeds which are collections of items sets of items are contained within their respective feeds the image below shows the relationships between the azure cosmos db resources a database account consists of a set of databases each containing multiple collections each of which can contain stored procedures triggers udfs documents and related attachments a database also has associated users each with a set of permissions to access various other collections stored procedures triggers udfs documents or attachments while databases users permissions and collections are systemdefined resources with wellknown schemas  documents stored procedures triggers udfs and attachments contain arbitrary user defined json content notesince the documentdb api was previously available as the azure documentdb service you can continue to provision monitor and manage accounts created via the azure resource management rest api or tools using either the azure documentdb or azure cosmos db resource names we use the names interchangeably when referring to the azure documentdb apis how can i develop apps with the documentdb api azure cosmos db exposes resources through the rest apis that can be called by any language capable of making httphttps requests additionally we offer programming libraries for several popular languages for the documentdb api the client libraries simplify many aspects of working with the api by handling details such as address caching exception management automatic retries and so forth libraries are currently available for the following languages and platforms download documentation net sdk net library nodejs sdk nodejs library java sdk java library javascript sdk javascript library na serverside javascript sdk python sdk python library na api for mongodb using the azure cosmos db emulator you can develop and test your application locally with the documentdb api without creating an azure subscription or incurring any costs when youre satisfied with how your application is working in the emulator you can switch to using an azure cosmos db account in the cloud beyond basic create read update and delete operations the documentdb api provides a rich sql query interface for retrieving json documents and server side support for transactional execution of javascript application logic the query and script execution interfaces are available through all platform libraries as well as the rest apis sql query the documentdb api supports querying documents using a sql language which is rooted in the javascript type system and expressions with support for relational hierarchical and spatial queries the documentdb query language is a simple yet powerful interface to query json documents the language supports a subset of ansi sql grammar and adds deep integration of javascript object arrays object construction and function invocation the documentdb api provides its query model without any explicit schema or indexing hints from the developer user defined functions udfs can be registered with the documentdb api and referenced as part of a sql query thereby extending the grammar to support custom application logic these udfs are written as javascript programs and executed within the database for net developers the documentdb api net sdk also offers a linq query provider transactions and javascript execution the documentdb api allows you to write application logic as named programs written entirely in javascript these programs are registered for a collection and can issue database operations on the documents within a given collection javascript can be registered for execution as a trigger stored procedure or user defined function triggers and stored procedures can create read update and delete documents whereas user defined functions execute as part of the query execution logic without write access to the collection javascript execution within the cosmos db is modeled after the concepts supported by relational database systems with javascript as a modern replacement for transactsql all javascript logic is executed within an ambient acid transaction with snapshot isolation during the course of its execution if the javascript throws an exception then the entire transaction is aborted are there any online courses on azure cosmos db yes theres a microsoft virtual academy course on azure documentdb next steps already have an azure account then you can get started with azure cosmos db by following our quick starts which will walk
