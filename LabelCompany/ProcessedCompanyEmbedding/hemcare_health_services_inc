results of operation shareholders equity plan of operations the company was organized january   date of inception under the laws of the state of nevada as dbl senior care inc and subsequently changed its name to hemcare health services inc on march   under previous management the initial business of the company was to provide personal care services to elderly physically disabled or other homebound individuals suffering infirmity during the year ended december   the board of directors changed the companys focus toward the manufacture and sale of fire retardant products the company then changed its focus to the licensing of certain technologies related to rare earth minerals then to having the exclusive rights to the use of optimum performance a proprietary formulation of a highly potent allinone daily feed supplement for the horse industry the company while still keeping within the health and wellness industries narrowed its focus to hemorrhoid medical procedures and entered into a license agreement to open hemorrhoid treatment centers and promote the ultroid hemorrhoid system globally during the year ended december   which was ceased in late  due to numerous issues and concerns with the licensors business technology and principals with the business focus potentially shifting the board asked for the former chief executive officers resignation and mr john wilkes returned to his former role as chief executive under mr wilkes leadership the company has been developing a new business strategy and objective still within the health care space but now focusing on the information exchange sector to this end management working together with significant shareholders have been developing strategies and alliances to fulfil this objective at the close of the fiscal year management began to develop a platform and portal for the information exchange with aim to completion and market launch in the nd quarter of  hemcare health services is developing a centralized system for patients lawyers  insurers to retrieve and access medical records the centralized system and portal is a cloudbased pipeda  hipaa compliant network of providers and record requestors utilizing a secure platform providers will be able to securely exchange records electronically with thirdparty requestors health care providers with proper authorization can also share records with each other addressing a  billion a year problem in national terms across the us hospitals spend more than  billion annually on customer intake more than  billion before any sort of medical procedure is done before a patient even steps out of a waiting room representing an incredible amount of time and money spent on intake administration despite the adoption of electronic health records ehr and health information exchanges hie providers are still mailing and faxing paper records because they have no pipeda or hipaa compliant method to exchange records electronically with these thirdparty requestors a recent study found that the current method of exchanging patient health information cost a single clinician practice  per year the company aims to remove these substantial burdens both on an administrative and financial basis people or firms simply use our secure online request form pay a small service fee and the company retrieves digitizes and stores the records at this point the requesting client can access the record globally  hours a day   days a week to view it or transfer it securely in fact clients can upload any new records to consolidate and keep all of their records securely in one place limited operating history need for additional capital there is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance our assets and business have not yet generated substantial or recurring revenues we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services we will require additional financing to cover costs that we expect to incur over the next twelve months we believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding our operations as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or other securities however we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our plan of operations in the absence of such financing we will not be able to continue and our business plan will fail table of contents results of operations revenues revenues during the three months ended march   and  were  the timing of generating revenues from the execution of the companys current business plan is presently undeterminable operating expenses total operating expenses were  and  during the three months ended march   and  the decrease in operating expenses relate to the timing of fees incurred for the audit of the companys financial statements for the years ended december   and  where audit fees were incurred for the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december   during the three months ended march   we did not incur audit fees for the our financial statements for the year ended december   until the second quarter of  other income loss the company had net other income of  during the three months ended march   compared to net other expense of  during the three months ended march   the increase in net other income is the result of debt forgiveness totaling  during the three months ended march   that did not exist in the prior period and the amortization of debt discounts associated with convertible notes payable there were outstanding during the three months ended march   and not during the three months ended march   net income loss the company had net income of  during the three months ended march   compared to a net loss of  during the three months ended march   the increase in net income is the result of timing of professional fees forgiveness of outstanding debts and the amortization of debt discounts as discussed previously liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had  of cash total current assets of  and current liabilities of  creating a working capital deficit of  current liabilities as of march   consisted of  of bank overdrafts  of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  of related party payables  of dividends payable and notes payable of  cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  during the three months ended march   compared to  used for the same period in  the decrease in cash used in operating activities is from an increase in noncash gains realized and a lesser change in working capital during the three months ended march   when compared to the three months ended march   cash from financing activities we have funded our business to date primarily from loans from directors or other related parties there are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing if we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations then we will not be able to continue our operations and our business will fail table of contents going concern through march   management has devoted most of its activities to developing a market for its products and services we have yet to generate revenues from our planned business activities have no cash on hand and have a working capital deficit of  which raises substantial doubt for the entity to be able to continue as a going concern future financing we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders there is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned operations offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders lawsuits to

hemorrhoids and can be very helpful in resolving hemorrhoids especially if the hemorrhoids are new or mild in nature the available treatments include  hemorrhoid cream hemorrhoid cream typically utilizes a vasoconstrictor to shrink blood vessels  astringents astringents are common remedies containing ingredients like witch hazel that reduce swelling they typically work for about  to  hours before they need to be reapplied  medicated wipes or pads these are very good for carrying around while you on the go wipes typically use protectants that condition the skin and add necessary

remedies use a blend of herbs to locate an effective herbal remedy for hemorrhoids look for ingredients like witch hazel butcher’s broom and horse chestnut medical procedures for hemorrhoids for severe cases of hemorrhoids you may need to consider medical intervention before considering a medical procedure take a look at the following alternatives and talk to the doctor about your options  sclerotherapy sclerotherapy is performed by a doctor an injection is administered into the hemorrhoidal tissue this procedure uses a chemical hardener to break down hemorrhoid tissue at times repeated treatments may be needed to successfully shrink the hemorrhoids after proper treatment the hemorrhoid should fall off during a normal bowel movement because of this continued therapy can permanently get rid of hemorrhoids typicallysclerotherapy is used to treat internal hemorrhoids that are considered bleeding hemorrhoids it is one of the least invasive procedures that are available for this type of hemorrhoid the chemical solution that is injected hardens the tissue and causes it to wither away typically the solution used is phenolbased together with almond oil or saline solution as a buffer if the hemorrhoids are unusually large then sclerotherapy is not the best option the main drawback of sclerotherapy is that it does not permanently get rid of hemorrhoids and they can return in about a year the second drawback is that if the surgeon is not very skilled in this procedure mild to severe complications can arise  rubber band ligation rubber band ligation is one of the most recommended hemorrhoidal remedies in the medical profession this is because it reduces the recurrence of hemorrhoids this procedure uses rubber bands to shrink hemorrhoids by cutting off the blood flow after hemorrhoids have time to wither away they fall off typically in about a week this procedure is one of the most popular treatments available because it is minimally invasive as compared to other remedies the downside of the treatment is that it causes pain in the rectal area and the lower abdomen this is because of the restrictions imposed on the live tissue in the hemorrhoid however if you are willing to put up with the initial pain you will have relief in about a week’s time rubber band ligation is a great treatment for hemorrhoids and can work for more than one hemorrhoid at a time your doctor may recommend treating more than two hemorrhoids at a time in this case you will be placed under general anesthesia rubber band ligation is one of the more heavily used hemorrhoid remedies it provides longlasting relief and there is less recurrence it is also one of the least expensive options  infrared photocoagulation this treatment is typically referred to as coagulation therapy it is typically used to treat small to mediumsized hemorrhoids that are internal the procedure is sometimes used for external hemorrhoids as well this therapy employs an intense beam of infrared light to

are a few popular methods to treat hemorrhoids with overthecounter options and how do these remedies reduce the severity of hemorrhoids by shrinking tissues most treatments available work for both internal and external hemorrhoids and can be very helpful in resolving hemorrhoids especially if the hemorrhoids are new or mild in nature the available treatments include  hemorrhoid cream hemorrhoid cream typically utilizes a vasoconstrictor to shrink blood vessels  astringents astringents are common remedies containing ingredients like witch hazel that reduce swelling they typically work for about  to  hours before they need to be reapplied  medicated wipes or pads these are very good for carrying around while you on the go wipes typically use protectants that condition the skin and add necessary nutrients some of these pads contain astringents  herbal remedies some of the most effective treatments for hemorrhoids contain herbal remedies that shrink hemorrhoids naturally most hemorrhoid remedies use a blend of herbs to locate an effective herbal remedy for hemorrhoids look for ingredients like witch hazel butcher’s broom and horse chestnut medical procedures for hemorrhoids for severe cases of hemorrhoids you may need to consider medical intervention before considering a medical procedure take a look at the following alternatives and talk to the doctor about your options  sclerotherapy sclerotherapy is performed by a doctor an injection is administered into the hemorrhoidal tissue this procedure uses a chemical hardener to break down hemorrhoid tissue at times repeated treatments may be needed to successfully shrink the hemorrhoids after proper treatment the hemorrhoid should fall off during a normal bowel movement because of this continued therapy can permanently get rid of hemorrhoids typicallysclerotherapy is used to treat internal hemorrhoids that are considered bleeding hemorrhoids it is one of the least invasive procedures that are available for this type of hemorrhoid the chemical solution that is injected hardens the tissue and causes it to wither away typically the solution used is phenolbased together with almond oil or saline solution as a buffer if the hemorrhoids are unusually large then sclerotherapy is not the best option the main drawback of sclerotherapy is that it does not permanently get rid of hemorrhoids and they can return in about a year the second drawback is that if the surgeon is not very skilled in this procedure mild to severe complications can arise  rubber band ligation rubber band ligation is one of the most recommended hemorrhoidal remedies in the medical profession this is because it reduces the recurrence of hemorrhoids this procedure uses rubber bands to shrink hemorrhoids by cutting off the blood flow after hemorrhoids have time to wither away they fall off typically in about a week this procedure is one of the most popular treatments available because it is minimally invasive as compared to other remedies the downside of the treatment is that it causes pain in the rectal area and the lower abdomen this is because of the restrictions imposed on the live tissue in the hemorrhoid however if you are willing to put up with the initial pain you will have relief in about a week’s time rubber band ligation is a great treatment for hemorrhoids and can work for more than one hemorrhoid at a time your doctor may recommend treating more than two hemorrhoids at a time in this case you will be placed under general anesthesia rubber band ligation is one of the more heavily used hemorrhoid remedies it provides longlasting relief and there is less recurrence it is also one of the least expensive options  infrared photocoagulation this treatment is typically referred to as coagulation therapy it is typically used to treat small to mediumsized hemorrhoids that are internal the procedure is sometimes used for external hemorrhoids as well this therapy employs an intense beam of infrared light to shrink hemorrhoids infrared light cuts off the blood supply and causes the hemorrhoid to wither away the downside is the extreme pain experienced right after the procedure make sure that your doctor is comfortable with prescribing pain medication immediately following the procedure before you agree to it like sclerotherapy this remedy has developed a
