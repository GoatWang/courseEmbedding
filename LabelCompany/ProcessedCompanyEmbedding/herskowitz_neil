preowned neil herskowitz’s fight for a nd chance dwain price    may  0may  0 dallas – after the numerous lifethreatening challenges he’s experienced neil herskowitz can truly appreciate some of the most mundane things in life things like taking a simple shower or being stuck in rushhour traffic as a double lung transplant recipient following a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis herskowitz recalls the times when taking a shower was a major task or when being able to get behind the wheel of a car was not a part of his daily routine “i think at least in my experience every day i wake up and even when i can take a shower without being out of breath that’s a win” herskowitz said “so if i’m sitting in traffic or i spill my coffee all over myself i don’t really care it doesn’t bother me nobody wants to sit in traffic but i usually think that ‘man this is pretty cool that i’m even here that i’m driving a car” for nearly two years herskowitz had to carry a portable oxygen tank to his job – he’s the assistant equipment manager for the dallas mavericks – just so he could breathe it was his mode of survival his fight against the inherited lifethreatening disorder that caused havoc in his life “i had a big oxygen tank at home that looked like a big trash can and i had that portable one i would fill up and basically connect off of the big one” herskowitz said “for a lot of reasons it was not an ideal situation “it wasn’t very userfriendly it was bulky it was hard to move around and it only lasted like six hours so it seemed like by the time i could make it down to american airlines center and be there for a little bit i had to kind of start getting back home because the oxygen was going to run out” the double lung transplant herskowitz underwent on october  0 changed all that and altered his life for the better these days herskowitz has moved out of his parents’ north dallas home and has his own apartment he’s also driving his own car without any repercussions whereas beforehand he was dependent on others to get him from point a to b “when neil’s lungs started to have problems from his mid and late0s he wasn’t sure he wanted to go through it because he thought he was going to be a burden to people” mavs coach rick carlisle said “there were obviously a lot of people both in our organization and in his private life that appealed to him that that was absolutely not the case and that your life was something that was worth fighting for” “when he decided to get on a list for a transplant it was a big step and then there became an available lung and he went through the whole thing it was painful but he had a lot of support from friends and family and of course the mavericks’ organization and he is as healthy as i’ve ever seen him” acting as their lucky charm the mavs honored herskowitz earlier this month by sending him to new york as one of their representatives at the nba draft lottery while in the big apple herskowitz got to mingle with some of the nba’s bigwigs and even did an interview on national tv mavs’ assistant equipment manager reps team in lotteryneil herskowitz tells cassidy hubbarth his inspirational story of life with cystic fibrosis and shares how proud he is to represent the mavericks organization in new york afterwards herskowitz hung around new york for a few days visiting — among other things — a couple of art museums and the new york public library “i definitely think it was cool that i was there in the first place because without the double lung transplant none of that happens and you and i aren’t having this conversation right now” herskowitz said “it’s easy to get caught up in that moment and reflect but to me you break it down and you think of all the little things along the way” “the fact that i could get on an airplane and didn’t have to bring an oxygen tank the fact that i could walk around in new york and go down the subway and go up a bunch of stairs and walk to central park there’s no way in hell i would have been doing any of that stuff before the transplant” no one employed by the mavs has worked closer with herskowitz during his medical journey than al whitley as the mavs’ equipment manager whitley has painfully seen herskowitz struggle just to simply make it through the day “for the last three or four years he was basically a skeleton of himself’’ whitley said “he was deteriorating away and his health was getting worse and worse and it was really hard to watch and be around him especially as close as we’ve been and worked together for over  years “when he decided that he was actually going to do the double lung transplant the progress he’s made since he’s a completely different person he went from maybe having weeks to months to live to he’s a completely new and energized person he’s gained his weight back he’s gained his personality and his sense of humor has come back” herskowitz  recalls the dark days when his weight dipped from  to 0 pounds he remembers the ninehour double lung transplant surgery at ut southwestern medical center and the threeweek stay in the hospital following the surgery regretfully herskowitz also recalls wanting to give up on life “there was a point when all i could really do was text and watch tv” herskowitz said “i was out breath but the fact that i can now walk into a coffee shop and sit down and get some coffee and walk out that’s pretty cool to me actually that’s very cool to me” carlisle noted how things shifted from good to bad to worse and back to good again for herskowitz over the years “when i first got here in  he was the fulltime assistant equipment manager and he was doing full duties” carlisle said “as time wore on in the next couple of years he was getting weaker and at a certain point was unable to keep going and that’s where he had doubts about whether he wanted to go on and this was something that really hit all of us at the mavs’ organization in such a deep way because we have such great love for this kid and we know that it’s always been a struggle at some level we just didn’t want to lose him” “he went through a very tough period before deciding to get the transplant but to see him now and see how healthy he is and how vivacious and enthusiastic every single day is it’s an amazing story and we’re all so proud” one of herskowitz’s two brothers richie died in  at the age of  of complications from cystic fibrosis “my brother and i were both born with cystic fibrosis” herskowitz said “when he was five years old is when he had his double lung transplant and he did reasonably well for a while but when he got older and when he hit the teenage years just with puberty – just like with anyone with all the changes that your body makes — then he started to struggle and he actually had a hard time getting around” “he didn’t grow he was about  pounds when he was  years old and he was on a scooter and he needed oxygen and he needed dialysis even though he was very sharp and very astute mentally he basically could do very very little physically” carlisle said folks should be inspired by the way herskowitz has overcome his many medical battles “we all go through what we perceive to be hard times and difficult periods but when you see a situation like neil’s and what he’s going through and the amount of pain the amount of apprehension and doubts he’s experienced it’s a pretty good reset button” carlisle said “the pretty particular small problems that we’re all having on a daytoday basis this gets you reset the right way” “it’s going to make people cry i cried many times during this whole thing over the last few years” whitley admires the fight herskowitz has fought the way he cheated death and has become a beacon of life to those who know him and are familiar with his medical history “he’s one of the toughest people i’ve ever been around in my life” whitley said “his fight and determination every day just to get through the day was just incredible to watch and it was hard to watch at times but he never gave up and he never complained and he kept on fighting through it “i’ve always considered him like my little brother he’s always come to me for advice — and vice versa — i’ve looked to him for advice all the time as well it was extremely tough to watch him go through all the heartache and the pain and the suffering and him deteriorating” herskowitz certainly shed more than his share of tears during his ordeal but after taking a deep emotional and physical downturn in 0 he’s now vibrant he’s back up to  pounds and says he’s “the healthiest” he’s ever been “i’ve got recycled parts certified preowned as i like to joke sometimes” herskowitz said “it’s a real gift” the precious gift of life that neil herskowitz doesn’t take for granted a precious gift that he frequently recalls whenever he takes a shower or is stuck in rushhour traffic to learn more about organ donation and how to signup to save lives visit organorg

york joining them was neil herskowitz who’s worked under equipment manager al whitley for almost a decade herskowitz received a doublelung transplant in 0 after battling cystic fibrosis for his entire life read more about his story here and watch his interview with espn’s cassidy hubbarth below mavs’ assistant equipment manager reps team in lotteryneil herskowitz tells cassidy hubbarth his inspirational story of life with cystic fibrosis and shares how proud he is to represent the mavericks organization in new york “i’m fortunate to say that things are going well now” herskowitz said “but really i’m just emblematic of a lot of people — some i don’t even know including hte donor’s family the benevolence that they’ve shown the care hard work and patience of doctors family friends obviously the mavericks’ staff from top to bottom” now nearly two years removed from his surgery herskowitz — also known by the team as “mclovin” — has become a source of inspiration for the entire organization rick carlisle brad davis and whitley shared their thoughts on herskowitz in a terrific piece on cbs toward the beginning of the season “this is as inspirational a kid as i’ve been around” carlisle said at the time “i love him like a little brother” herskowitz’s bravery in the face of a terrible situation has given the entire team a lift for some time and it’s easy to see why he’s the kind of guy who always makes you laugh no matter who you are or what kind of mood you’re in even if you only talk to him for five seconds it was awesome to see him represent the team in new york herskowitz sat in the room where the ping pong balls were drawn which put a lot of responsibility on his shoulders however he didn’t take any superstitious charms “i don’t believe in good luck but what i do believe in is the greater the stage the bigger i rage” he said the mavs wound up with the no  pick in the draft matching their projected position heading into the evening although the club wasn’t able to move up dallas still believes it has a great chance at landing a player who can produce immediately as the draft process unfolds the mavs will begin working out rookies they might be interested in selecting with that ninth pick one thing they’ll be looking for in prospects is the measure of their character from the very top this is an organization full of uniquely good people who care about basketball and each other and while herskowitz might not have persuaded the basketball gods into giving dallas a higher pick he still proudly represented the team’s best quality share

challenges he’s experienced neil herskowitz can truly appreciate some of the most mundane things in life things like taking a simple shower or being stuck in rushhour traffic as a double lung transplant recipient following a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis herskowitz recalls the times when taking a shower was a major task or when being able to get behind the wheel of a car was not a part of his daily routine “i think at least in my experience every day i wake up and even when i can take a shower without being out of breath that’s a win” herskowitz said “so if i’m sitting in traffic or i spill my coffee all over myself i don’t really care it doesn’t bother me nobody wants to sit in traffic but i usually think that ‘man this is pretty cool that i’m even here that i’m driving a car” for nearly two years herskowitz had to carry a portable oxygen tank to his job – he’s the assistant equipment manager for the dallas mavericks – just so he could breathe it was his mode of survival his fight against the inherited lifethreatening disorder that caused havoc in his life “i had a big oxygen tank at home that looked like a big trash can and i had that portable one i would fill up and basically connect off of the big one” herskowitz said “for a lot of reasons it was not an ideal situation “it wasn’t very userfriendly it was bulky it was hard to move around and it only lasted like six hours so it seemed like by the time i could make it down to american airlines center and be there for a little bit i had to kind of start getting back home because the oxygen was going to run out” the double lung transplant herskowitz underwent on october  0 changed all that and altered his life for the better these days herskowitz has moved out of his parents’ north dallas home and has his own apartment he’s also driving his own car without any repercussions whereas beforehand he was dependent on others to get him from point a to b “when neil’s lungs started to have problems from his mid and late0s he wasn’t sure he wanted to go through it because he thought he was going to be a burden to people” mavs coach rick carlisle said “there were obviously a lot of people both in our organization and in his private life that appealed to him that that was absolutely not the case and that your life was something that was worth fighting for” “when he decided to get on a list for a transplant it was a big step and then there became an available lung and he went through the whole thing it was painful but he had a lot of support from friends and family and of course the mavericks’ organization and he is as healthy as i’ve ever seen him” acting as their lucky charm the mavs honored herskowitz earlier this month by sending him to new york as one of their representatives at the nba draft lottery while in the big apple herskowitz got to mingle with some of the nba’s bigwigs and even did an interview on national tv mavs’ assistant equipment manager reps team in lotteryneil herskowitz tells cassidy hubbarth his inspirational story of life with cystic fibrosis and shares how proud he is to represent the mavericks organization in new york afterwards herskowitz hung around new york for a few days visiting — among other things — a couple of art museums and the new york public library “i definitely think it was cool that i was there in the first place because without the double lung transplant none of that happens and you and i aren’t having this conversation right now” herskowitz said “it’s easy to get caught up in that moment and reflect but to me you break it down and you think of all the little things along the way” “the fact that i could get on an airplane and didn’t have to bring an oxygen tank the fact that i could walk around in new york and go down the subway and go up a bunch of stairs and walk to central park there’s no way in hell i would have been doing any of that stuff before the transplant” no one employed by the mavs has worked closer with herskowitz during his medical journey than al whitley as the mavs’ equipment manager whitley has painfully seen herskowitz struggle just to simply make it through the day “for the last three or four years he was basically a skeleton of himself’’ whitley said “he was deteriorating away and his health was getting worse and worse and it was really hard to watch and be around him especially as close as we’ve been and worked together for over  years “when he decided that he was actually going to do the double lung transplant the progress he’s made since he’s a completely different person he went from maybe having weeks to months to live to he’s a completely new and energized person he’s gained his weight back he’s gained his personality and his sense of humor has come back” herskowitz  recalls the dark days when his weight dipped from  to 0 pounds he remembers the ninehour double lung transplant surgery at ut southwestern medical center and the threeweek stay in the hospital following the surgery regretfully herskowitz also recalls wanting to give up on life “there was a point when all i could really do was text and watch tv” herskowitz said “i was out breath but the fact that i can now walk into a coffee shop and sit down and get some coffee and walk out that’s pretty cool to me actually that’s very cool to me” carlisle noted how things shifted from good to bad to worse and back to good again for herskowitz over the years “when i first got here in  he was the fulltime assistant equipment manager and he was doing full duties” carlisle said “as time wore on in the next couple of years he was getting weaker and at a certain point was unable to keep going and that’s where he had doubts about whether he wanted to go on and this was something that really hit all of us at the mavs’ organization in such a deep way because we have such great love for this kid and we know that it’s always been a struggle at some level we just didn’t want to lose him” “he went through a very tough period before deciding to get the transplant but to see him now and see how healthy he is and how vivacious and enthusiastic every single day is it’s an amazing story and we’re all so proud” one of herskowitz’s two brothers richie died in  at the age of  of complications from cystic fibrosis “my brother and i were both born with cystic fibrosis” herskowitz said “when he was five years old is when he had his double lung transplant and he did reasonably well for a while but when he got older and when he hit the teenage years just with puberty – just like with anyone with all the changes that your body makes — then he started to struggle and he actually had a hard time getting around” “he didn’t grow he was about  pounds when he was  years old and he was on a scooter and he needed oxygen and he needed dialysis even though he was very sharp and very astute mentally he basically could do very very little physically” carlisle said folks should be inspired by the way herskowitz has overcome his many medical battles “we all go through what we perceive to be hard times and difficult periods but when you see a situation like neil’s and what he’s going through and the amount of pain the amount of apprehension and doubts he’s experienced it’s a pretty good reset button” carlisle said “the pretty particular small problems that we’re all having on a daytoday basis this gets you reset the right way” “it’s going to make people cry i cried many times during this whole thing over the last few years” whitley admires the fight herskowitz has fought the way he cheated death and has become a beacon of life to those who know him and are familiar with his medical history “he’s one of the toughest people i’ve ever been around in my life” whitley said “his fight and determination every day just to get through the day was just incredible to watch and it was hard to watch at times but he never gave up and he never complained and he kept on fighting through it “i’ve always considered him like my little brother he’s always come to me for advice — and vice versa — i’ve looked to him for advice all the time as well it was extremely tough to watch him go through all the heartache and the pain and the suffering and him deteriorating” herskowitz certainly shed more than his share of tears during his ordeal but after taking a deep emotional and physical downturn in 0 he’s now vibrant he’s back up to  pounds and says he’s “the healthiest” he’s ever been “i’ve got recycled parts certified preowned as i like to joke sometimes” herskowitz said “it’s a real gift” the precious gift of life that neil herskowitz doesn’t take for granted a precious gift that he frequently recalls whenever he takes a shower or is stuck in rushhour
