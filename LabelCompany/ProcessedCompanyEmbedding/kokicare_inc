the company’s competition comes from software and technology companies that develop or sell enterprise software in the global healthcare market the industry has many players with diverse solutions company description kokicare inc was incorporated on april   under the laws of the state of delaware the company is in the discovery and planning phase to develop a realtime saasbased enterprise software application to manage the integration planning tracking and management of healthcare assets which include people supplies clinical data relationships and financial resources of healthcare organizations kokicare is currently in the design phase to develop a healthcare analytics software platform to assist healthcare professionals with business analytics performance management and data warehousing with increased regulatory requirements and technology improvements in the healthcare industry companies are inundated with greater volumes of data than ever before our technology will provide for healthcare organizations to store manage and access their data in meaningful ways improving patient care and financial performance the company plans to hire software engineers to develop a webbased application using the latest microsoft stack tools with an intuitive web ui our saas modeled application will be scalable and flexible with multiple modules integrated into the end product the software will be licensed on an annual contract by hospitals clinics and other healthcare facilities the revenues generated from the licensing fees and upfront integration fees will create a sustainable revenue model we have identified software engineers to perform the implementation phase but those individuals are currently not under any obligation or contract with kokicare after we have completed the design phase of the software platform and have raised sufficient capital for the implementation phase we will hire engineers to begin development we anticipate the design phase will require approximately  months and the implementation phase will require  to  months our founder and ceo jason lane will complete the design phase we plan to hire  full time developers to complete the implementation phase in our estimation the capital required for the implementation phase will be  after the completion of the implementation phase the software application will be market ready post implementation jason lane will perform the sales function for the company as customers are contracted the development team will handle necessary integrations and ongoing customer support customer contracts will require upfront integration fees and ongoing license fees in excess of required costs including development talent and hosting fees there is significant risk in our ability to successfully i complete the design phase ii raise the required capital to hire engineers to begin the implementation phase iii successfully implement and release the software application with all requirements iv contract one or more customers to use the software application and v price the application so that we receive revenues sufficient to cover the operating expenses of the company

inc the “company” was incorporated on april   under the laws of the state of delaware the company aims to develop health care enterprise software to be sold to hospitals medical centers and health care facilities in the united states and internationally   note   summary of significant accounting policies   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles   basis of presentation   the company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”   fiscal yearend   the company elected june th as its fiscal year ending date   use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were as follows   i assumption as a going concern  management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business    ii valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  management assumes that the realization of the company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss “nol” carry–forwards for federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are offset by a full valuation allowance management made this assumption based on a the company has incurred recurring losses b general economic conditions and c its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering among other factors   these significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value   management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources        management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification “paragraph ” to measure the fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below         level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument   the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents   commitment and contingencies   the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification to report accounting for contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company assessed such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed        loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed management does not believe based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows however there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial position and results of operations or cash flows   revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured   research and development   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification formerly statement of financial accounting standards no  “accounting for research and development costs”  and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification formerly statement of financial accounting standards no  “research and development arrangements”  for research and development costs research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred research and development costs consist primarily of remuneration for material and testing costs for research and development there was no research and development for the three months ended september     income tax provision   the company accounts for income taxes under section  of the fasb accounting standards codification deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date   the company adopted section  of the fasb accounting standards codification “section ” section  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures   the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets as well as tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards the company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary   management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years if actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary all tax years since inception are open for examination by taxing authorities   uncertain tax positions   the company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of section  for the three months ended september          net income loss per common share   net income loss per common share is computed pursuant to section  of the fasb accounting standards codification basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements stock options and warrants   the company issued convertible promissory notes on april   and may   in the aggregate of  see note  the promissory notes were potentially dilutive due to their convertible features however due to the net loss for the reported periods the notes were determined to be nondilutive   there were no other potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the for the three months ended september     recently issued accounting pronouncements   management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements if adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements   note  – notes payable   note payable  related party   on june   the company issued an unsecured note payable in the amount of  to a relative of the ceo the note accrues interest at  per annum and is payable on or before june   the outstanding balance including accrued interest at september   and june   was  and  respectively   convertible notes payable   on april   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement “spa” in connection with the issuance of a convertible promissory note “note ” in the aggregate principal amount of  the note matured on october     on may   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement “spa” in connection with the issuance of a convertible promissory note “note ” in the aggregate principal amount of  the note matured on november     note  and note  bear interest at  per annum and together with all accrued interest are convertible into shares of the company’s common stock at a price equal to  multiplied by the average of the lowest three  trading prices for the common stock during the ten  trading day period prior to the date of conversion provided however that in no event shall the holder convert any portion of the notes which would result in beneficial ownership of more than  the spas and the notes contain representations warranties conditions restrictions and covenants of the company that are customary in such transactions with smaller companies the outstanding balances on note  and note  at september   were  and  respectively no beneficial conversion feature was recorded on note  or note  because the company’s stock had minimal trading as of september     the notes may be accelerated by the holder in the event of default and the rate of interest on the notes will increase to  per annum retroactive to the date of issuance the notes are direct financial obligations of the company and are considered current liabilities of the company for accounting purposes   on november   note  was restructured as a nonconvertible promissory note and note  was paid in full see note  – subsequent events   note  – going concern   the financial statements have been prepared assuming that
