into methods and products in the field of crop protection back to top bayer and the aventis cropscience purchase in early october  bayer ag finally acquired aventis cropscience at a cost of bn euro £bn their largest single purchase ever in so doing bayer cropscience as its new agriculture division will be known have become the second largest agrochemical and seed company in the world behind syngenta they have also become the leading company pushing forward the commercialisation of gm crops in the uk and europe and arejust one of a few companies selling gm crops in the us canada and elsewhere in the world aventis cropscience was formed in late  by the merger of agrevo itself a joint venture between the agricultural businesses of hoechst and schering and the agricultural business of rhonepoulenc at the time of the sale to bayer aventis cropscience had a substantial portfolio of products including gm seeds both herbicide tolerant and insectresistant lines and a range of agrochemicals its  sales were worth  million euros and it employed about  people in more than  countries worldwide having shed its lossmaking cropscience business it is also currently in the process of selling off its animal nutrition business aventis is now concentrating on pharmaceuticals it will however retain all future liability for damages claims made in relation to last years  starlink gm contamination scandal aventis have already launched a huge advertising campaign to try to rebrand themselves as the squeaky clean benevolent drugs company that will save the world see the cw subvert on the back cover of the december  edition of the ecologist despite considerable existing holdings in crop protection until now bayer has kept its distance from gm crops preferring a more traditional reliance on agrochemicals its acquisition of aventis cropscience has vastly enhanced bayers agricultural sector particularly in herbicides and conventional and gm seeds bayer now owns over half of the gm crop varieties currently seeking approval for commercial growing in the eu these include  varieties of oilseed rape and one variety of maize all of which are modified to be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium or liberty also now owned by bayer should the de facto eu moratorium on the commercial growing of gm crops be lifted bayer will be best placed to flood european fields with gm crops in the uk bayer will be responsible for the majority of gm field trials including the controversial farm scale trials during  the new bayer cropscience will form one of bayers new independent corporate units at the time of writing late january  it is uncertain quite how the new company will look the european commission has launched an enquiry into the cropscience purchase claiming that competition may be significantly reduced in the areas of insecticides herbicides fungicides and seed treatment products bayer may be forced to sell off certain areas of cropscience prior to the acquisition basf had expressed an interest in buying some or all of aventis insecticide business although the composition of the management of the new company has recently been announced it remains to be seen quite how bayers existing agricultural concerns will be merged with aventis cropscience and what the implications will be for shedding of infrastructure and job losses recent articles in the financial press suggest that the merging of the two agricultural businesses may result in   job loses  likewise its strategy for expanding sales of gm crops is still unknown for more
