provided by a single layer of alignment layer material is greater than or equal to about ° description cross reference to related applications  this application claims benefit of pending us provisional application nos  and  both filed on jan  background of the invention  liquid crystal displays lcd are currently used for a variety of display applications such as watch faces calculators computer screens and other types of electronic equipment lcd technology offers widely known advantages over traditional display technologies such as cathode ray tubes among these advantages are low weight and low power consumption  liquid crystal displays however have previously been considered to provide a narrower field of view than traditional display technologies such as the previously mentioned cathode ray tubes  liquid crystal displays typically contain a plurality of liquid crystal cells each liquid crystal cell generally contains a liquid crystal material sandwiched between two substrates located on either side of the liquid crystal material is a set of electrodes which are typically indiumtin oxide ito or tin oxide a pair of polarizing filters is located outside of the substrates with each filter on an opposite side of the liquid crystal cell the polarizers are oriented at right angles relative to each other the orientation of the liquid crystal material in the cell determines whether light passes through each polarizer in the absence of external influence such as an electric field thereby giving a transparent appearance or whether light is blocked by one of the polarizers thereby giving the cell a darkened appearance the orientation of the liquid crystal material is changed by the application of an electric field by the electrodes to alter light transmission through the cell typically the liquid crystal material is aligned such that the cell appears opaque or transparent absent an application of an electric field through the electrodes when an electric field is applied to such a cell the orientation of the liquid crystal material is altered in such a way as to prevent the transmission of light through the cell making the cell appear darkened  the orientation of a liquid crystal material at its surface is dependent on the orientation of material it comes in contact with it is known to coat the surface of a substrate with an agent which influences the orientation of a liquid crystal material that comes in contact with the coated substrate such coating agents are known as alignment layers various materials and methods have been used in establishing an alignment layer of a desired orientation for example it is known in the art that an alignment layer may comprise anisotropically absorbing molecules which can be oriented by exposure to polarized light inorganic thin films such as metal oxide films which have been deposited on a substrate at an oblique angle can also be used as alignment layers as disclosed in us pat no   it is also known to use a polymeric alignment layer which can be oriented by means of a mechanical buffing process in such a process a polymer layer is applied to a substrate and is buffed with a cloth or other fibrous material liquid crystal material coming into contact with a surface treated in this way typically aligns itself parallel to the direction of buffing  polyimides are frequently used as a polymeric alignment material for liquid crystal cells and for optical compensator layers including oplate compensators polyimides generally display good chemical stability and are easily deposited on a substrate and rubbed polyimides are generally prepared by contacting a diamine with an acid anhydride producing a polyamic acid this polyamic acid may be coated onto a substrate and heat treated at about °° c converting the polyamic acid to a polyimide the polyimide film is then mechanically rubbed as mentioned above  inducing the proper orientation of liquid crystal material is important in optical compensators as mentioned above lcds frequently have a narrow field of view it is frequently desirable to increase this field of view especially in applications such as computer displays avionic displays and televisions the viewing zone of an lcd that is not equipped with an optical compensator is narrow because light leaks through the liquid crystal material when viewed at angles other than those close to normal relative to the surface of the liquid crystal such light leakage degrades the image quality and can also cause color shifts in color lcds optical compensators have been used to increase the viewable angle of lcds without negatively affecting image quality when viewed normal to the surface of the lcd optical compensators typically take the form of an additional layer of liquid crystal material located between a polarizer and the viewing area on the outer surface of an lcd this liquid crystal material may be given a specific orientation under the influence of an alignment layer material  oplate compensation films or oplate compensators are one type of optical compensator oplate compensators generally minimize reversal of gray levels and improve overall gray scale stability oplate compensators have been previously described as comprising a positive birefringent material which has a principle optic axis oriented at an oblique angle relative to the surface of the liquid crystal layer an oblique angle includes any angle between ° and ° in previous oplate compensators this angle has been provided in various ways for example us pat no  describes an oplate compensator which includes an alignment layer a liquid crystal pretilt layer and a liquid crystal compensator layer the described oplate compensator depends on the liquid crystal pretilt layer to provide an adequate pretilt angle for the liquid crystal compensator layer because the alignment layer produces only a ° to ° liquid crystal pretilt angle at the alignment layerliquid crystal pretilt layer interface the described oplate compensator therefore depends on multiple layers of liquid crystal material to provide an adequate angle of orientation of the liquid crystal material a similar oplate compensator is also described in us pat no  and pct application no wo  the use of high pretilt alignment layers is also known in lcds known as picells  it should be appreciated that the term “pretilt angle” has frequently been used in the prior art to describe a final angle provided by a combination of an alignment layer and a liquid crystal layer heretofore no single polyimide alignment layer for a liquid crystal layer has provided a pretilt angle greater than about °  therefore there is a need for a polyimide alignment layer material which can provide a high uniform pretilt angle summary of the invention  in general the present invention provides a polyimide comprising a reaction product of at least one dianhydride and at least one diamine wherein the at least one diamine contains a mesogenic group with the proviso that when the at least one dianhydride is ′bisdicarboxyphenylhexafluoropropane dianhydride fda or dibromobiphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride the at least one diamine is not   wherein a is selected from the group consisting of o and coo  the present invention also provides a method for inducing a predetermined orientation of a liquid crystal material the method comprising applying an alignment layer material to a substrate and buffing the alignment layer material thereby providing an alignment layer with a pretilt angle wherein the alignment layer material is a reaction product of at least one dianhydride and at least one diamine and wherein the at least one diamine contains a pendent mesogenic groupbrief description

amounts of diamines with mesogenic pendent groups cbp and diamines with perfluorinated carbon pendent groups pfmbdetailed description of the invention  the present invention is directed toward polyimides which can be used to prepare liquid crystal display alignment layers for a liquid crystal device such as an optical compensator for example the polyimides of the present invention contain mesogenic substituents and may optionally include functional substituents polyimides may be schematically represented by the structure   wherein a is one or more residues from an acid dianhydride group and b is one or more residues from a diamine compound and n is a positive number it has been known that the properties of the polyimide may be altered by varying the components “a” and “b” as listed above however the use of polyimides containing mesogenic substituents to prepare high pretilt alignment layers has not been previously known in the present invention mesogenic groups are contributed to the structure of a polyimide by the diamine component any acid dianhydride useful in the synthesis of polyimides may be utilized in the present invention such acid dianhydrides are commercially available  as mentioned above polyimide polymers are prepared from diamines containing pendent mesogenic groups in one particular example the diamine contains a backbone portion a methylene spacer a linking group and a pendent mesogenic group the pendent mesogenic group is attached to the methylene spacer the methylene spacer is attached to the linking group and the linking group is attached to the backbone portion the linking group is selected from the group consisting of an ester and an ether in another embodiment suitable diamines are represented by formulas i and ii below   in formulas i and ii r is an ester or ether linking group r is a mesogenic group or a functional group as defined below and x is a positive number in formula i r is hydrogen or a halogen in one embodiment x is between  and  in another example x is between  and  in one particular example x is  in another example r is bromine  mesogenic groups are groups with a rodlike molecular structure that is mesogenic groups or simply mesogens are groups with a length to width ratio of at least  functional groups are those groups which allow one polyimide molecule to react with another molecule among preferred functional groups are groups which permit the crosslinking of polyimide molecules within a layer especially preferred functional groups include molecules which allow the photopolymerization of polyimide molecules such as acrylate and methacrylate groups suitable diamines include those containing a substituent selected from the group of compounds containing one or more of the subunits represented by formulas iii iv v and vi   in formula vi x may be hydrogen or an organic group having from  to  carbon atoms and r may be an organic group selected from the group consisting of esters ethers groups containing a methylene subunit groups containing a crosslinking subunit and groups containing a combination of any of these subunits groups containing acrylate or methacrylate subunits may be crosslinked such as by photopolymerization for example in one example x is an organic group containing between  and  carbon atoms in another example x is an organic group containing between  and  carbon atoms in still another example x is a methyl group in yet another example when the at least one dianhydride is ′bisdicarboxyphenylhexafluoropropane dianhydride or dibromobiphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride the substituent is not represented by formula v  by way of example and not of limitation a mesogenic group shown in vi may be synthesized by the following method as described below with reference to fig  ethyl hydroxybenzoic ester is alkylated with chlorohexanol to produce intermediate  intermediate  was used in two different reactions in the first reaction the hydroxyl group of intermediate  was protected using dihydropyran dhp forming intermediate  intermediate  was then hydrolyzed to form a thpbenzoic acid derivative  in the second reaction intermediate  was hydrolyzed to generate a hydroxy terminated benzoic acid  the hydroxy terminated benzoic acid  is contacted with chchcocl in an organic solvent to form a intermediate  tertbutyl dimethylsilyl chloride tbdms was used to protect methyl hydroquinone the major isomer was isolated by chromatography and then reacted with the thpbenzoic acid derivative  forming intermediate  this reaction product was then selectively deprotected using tertbutylamonium fluoride tbaf in tetrahydrofuran thf to form intermediate  intermediate  was esterified with intermediate  forming ester  and the resulting ester was deprotected with amberlystr in a mixture of methanol and thf forming mesogenic group  various components used in this synthesis method may be varied to affect the composition of the resulting diamine without undue experimentation  mesogenic group  may be contacted with dinitro diphenic acid followed by tin ii chloride reduction in ethanol to form a diamine of formula i such a diamine may be used to prepare a polyimide of the present invention  mesogens within the class encompassed by v may be synthesized in the following manner cyano′hydroxybiphenyl may be contacted with an ωbromoalkanol in an sn reaction in refluxing acetone over  days this results in the production of a ωhydroxyalkoxy′cyanobiphenyl compound which may be further purified by recrystalization from ethanol alternatively cyano′hydroxybiphenyl may be contacted with an αω alkanediol in a mitsunobu reaction to form a ωhydroxyalkoxy′cyanobiphenyl compound the product of the mitsunobu reaction may be purified by flash chromatography mesogens within the class encompassed by iv may be synthesized by similar methods by starting with a hydroxybiphenyl compound instead of cyano′hydroxybiphenyl  these mesogens may be used to produce mesogencontaining diamine compounds of formula i by coupling the mesogen with a dinitro diphenic acid using the standard dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dccdmap procedure to produce a dinitro intermediate compound alternatively dinitro diphenic acid may be converted to ′dinitro′biphenylcarbonyl chloride by refluxing with thionyl chloride the mesogen may be contacted with ′dinitro′biphenylcarbonyl chloride in an organic solvent such as triethylamine or methylene chloride to produce a dinitro intermediate the dinitro intermediate may be reduced to form a diamine by stannous chloride reduction or by reduction using hydrazine in an organic solvent at ° c  mesogens of the present invention may also be coupled to brominated biphenylcarboxylic acids to produced brominated diamines of formula i cyanuric acid is contacted with bromine and the resulting compound is used to brominate ′dinitro′biphenylcarboxylic acid yielding ′dibromo′biphenylcarboxylic acid this brominated carboxylic acid may be coupled with a mesogen and reduced as described above to produce a brominated diamine  diamines of formula ii may be synthesized by the following technique dinitrobenzoic acid is esterified with noctadecanol to afford noctadecyl dinitrobenzoate using dcc as a dehydration agent in dichloroethane the dinitrobenzoate is reduced to noctadecyl diaminobenzoate using hydrazine as a reducing agent by substituting other alcohols for noctadecanol the value of x in formula ii may be varied  diamines of the present invention may be purified by chromatography on deactivated silica gel and subsequent recrystalization purified diamines may then be contacted with acid dianhydrides to produce polyimides the synthesis of polyimides is known in the art see for example “synthesis and characterization of aromatic polyesters and polyimides containing mesogenic pendent groups” phd dissertation of shyhyeu wang the university of akron december  the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference briefly summarized polyimide precursors may be synthesized from dianhydrides and diamines by either a step or a step method in the step method a soluble polyimide precursor ie a polyamic acid is prepared by the reaction of dianhydrate and diamine in a polar aprotic solvent at room temperature the polyimide precursor is cyclodehydrated to form the corresponding polyimide either by thermal or chemical methods the step method gives high molecular weight polyimides if the diamine is highly reactive however when the diamine contains electron withdrawing groups such as cf cn and no for example the reactivity of the diamine is reduced and low molecular weight products result when such electron withdrawing groups are present the step method is preferred in the step method polymerization is carried out by heating the dianhydride and diamine at °° c in high boiling solvents such as mcresol and pchlorophenol for example in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst under these conditions polymerization and imidization occur essentially simultaneously the water generated from imidization is continuously removed such as by distillation for example  it has surprisingly been found that the pretilt angle of the alignment layer may be altered by varying the composition of various substituents of mesogencontaining polyimides for example the linking group r in formulas i and ii greatly influences the pretilt angle generated by the resulting polyimide when r is an ester group the resulting polyimide has a greater pretilt angle than when r is an ether group it has also been determined that a cyanosubstituted biphenyl mesogenic group formula v for example gives a polyimide that exhibits a slightly higher pretilt angle than a polyimide containing a nonsubstituted biphenyl mesogenic group formula iv  an alignment layer material made from the polyimide of the present invention provides a high pretilt angle in one embodiment the alignment layer provides a pretilt angle between about  and about ° preferably the alignment layer provides a pretilt angle between about  and about  more preferably the polyimide layer provides a pretilt angle between about  and about  in one particular example the polyimide layer provides a pretilt angle between about ° and about ° it will be appreciated that the pretilt angle described herein relates to the use of one single alignment layer with one single liquid crystal layer and not a plurality of layers to obtain the above mentioned angles a greater thickness of liquid crystal material is not required  it has also been determined that the dianhydride used to synthesize a mesogencontaining polyimide also affects the pretilt angle for example the dianhydride ′bisdicarboxyphenylhexafluoropropane dianhydride fda provides a polyimide with a greater pretile angle than a similar polyimide based on ′′biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride bpda the present invention is not limited to the dianhydrides fda and bpda any acid dianhydride suitable for generating traditional polyimides for alignment layers may also be used in the polyimide of the present invention among other acceptable acid dianhydrides are ′bis dicarboxyphenoxyphenylpropane dianhydride bisada pyromellitic diahydride pmda dibromobiphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride diphenylpyromellitic dianhydride bistrifluoromethylpyromellitic dianhydride bismethyl pyromellitic dianhydride diidopyromellitic dianhydride dibromopyromellitic dianhydride dichloropyromellitic dianhydride ′′benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride ′′benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride ′′benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride bisdicarboxyphenylmethane dianhydride bistrifluorodicarboxyphenylmethane dianhydride bisdicarboxyphenylpropane dianhydride bisdicarboxyphenylether dianhydride ′oxydiphthalic anhydride bisdicarboxyphenylsulfone dianhydride ′′diphenylsulfonetetracarboxylic dianhydride ′′isopropylidenedipphenyleneoxybisphthalic anhydride nndicarboxyphenylnmethylamine dianhydride bisdicarboxyphenyldiethylsilane dianhydride naphthalene tetracarboxylic acid dianhydrides such as  and naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride dichloronaphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride or heterocyclic aromatic tetracarboxylic acid dianhydrides such as thiophenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride pyrazinetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and pyridinetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride  substituents in the diamine component other than the mesogenic group also affect the pretilt angle of the resulting polyimide when a diamine component contains only mesogenic substituents a polyimide with a greater pretilt angle results compared to similar polyimides containing a diamine component which contain bromine substituents as well as mesogenic substituents  the pretilt angle of a polyimide can also be varied by copolymerization of a mixture of diamines with a dianhydride in such an example a diamine containing pendent mesogen groups may be mixed with a diamine containing perfluorinated carbon atoms and polymerized with a diamine such as fda  finally it has been found that increasing the length of a methylene spacer gives a higher pretilt angle at lower heat treatment temperatures the pretilt angle yielded by such polyimide used as an alignment layer however decreases rapidly as the heat treatment temperatures increase  in order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention polyimides containing pendant mesogen groups contributed by a diamine were synthesized and tested for the pretilt angle they produced in the following examples one or more diamines and an acid dianhydride were polymerized in refluxing mcresol chloronapthalene or odichlorobenzene containing isoquinoline at ° c a nitrogen purge was used to remove the water the polymers were isolated by precipitation in methanol and dried under reduced pressure at about ° c for  hours the resulting polyimides were dissolved in an organic solvent such as cyclopentanone and nmethylpyrrolidone nmp at  weight percent and filtered through  μm filters alignment layers were formed by spin coating on an indiumtin oxide ito glass substrate at  rpm the layers were heat treated at ° c ° c ° c or ° c before mechanical rubbing the rubbing was carried out on a lcbm liquid crystal buffing machine liquid crystal displays were then constructed via a standard procedure zli liquid crystal molecules available from merck were added to the cells at room temperature the pretilt angles provided by the polyimides were determined by either the crystal rotating method or the magnetic null method the composition of the various polyimides tested an abbreviation of each polyimide the pretilt angle provided by each polyimide and comments regarding the observed uniformity of the alignment layer are summarized in tables  a prior art polyimide fdapfmb is also included in table  for comparison purposes pretilt angles after heat treatment at ° c are listed in table  in table  pretilt angles were measured after heat treatment at ° c except as

table  a number of different factors affect the pretilt angle provided by the polyimide of the present invention the type of linkage between the mesogen and the aromatic portion of the diamine is one such factor for example fdaccn provides a pretilt angle of ° while fdaccnether provides a pretilt angle of  these polyimides differ from each other only in the type of linkage between the mesogen and the aromatic group it is apparent therefore that the ester linkage of fdaccn provides a greater pretilt angle than the ether linkage of fdaccnether  as also shown in table  the use of a cyanosubstituted mesogen gives a polyimide which provides a slightly higher pretilt angle than a nonsubstituted mesogen for example the pretilt angle provided by fdaccn is greater than the pretilt angle provided by fdacbiph these compounds differ only in the substitution of the biphenyl portion of the mesogens of each polyimide  the dianhydride used in the polyimides of the present invention also affect the pretilt angle for example fda provides a greater pretilt angle than bpda when linked to brccn fdabrccn provides a pretilt angle of ° while bpdabrccn provides a pretilt angle of   substituents in the diamine component other than the mesogenic group also affect the pretilt angle of the resulting polyimide a diamine component that contains only mesogenic substituents such as fdaccn provides a polyimide with a greater pretilt angle than a similar polyimide such as fdabrccn which contains a diamine component having bromine substituents as well as mesogenic substituents the pretilt angle of fdaccn is ° while the pretilt angle of fdabrccn is ° these polyimides differ only in the presence of bromine substituents on the diamine portion of fdabrccn  as the data in table  indicate heat treatment temperature influences the pretilt angle provided by the polyimide the pretilt angles of fdaccn and fdaccnether after heat treatment at ° c ° c ° c and ° c are compared graphically in fig  the pretilt angles of fdaccn and fdacbp are compared in fig  and the pretilt angles of fdaccn and fdaccn are compared in fig  after similar heat treatments the pretilt angles provided by fdaccn fdagcnether and fdacbp are relatively similar over the heat treatment temperatures tested as shown in tables  and  the pretilt angle provided by fdaccn however decreases as the heat treatment temperature increases as seen in fig  the pretilt angle provided by fdaccn is about ° at a heat treatment temperature of ° c at a heat treatment temperature of ° the pretilt angle drops to about   a mixture of diamines may also be used to synthesize a polyimide for use as an alignment layer by altering the composition of the polyimide the pretilt angle can be varied fig  is a graph showing the pretilt angles of polyimides containing diamines with mesogenic pendent groups cbp diamines with perfluorinated carbon pendent groups pfmb or mixtures thereof fig  illustrates that the pretilt angle provided by a polyimide obtaining its diamine component only from pfmb is  the pretilt angle of a polyimide obtaining its diamine component from a mixture of pfmb and cbp increases as the percentage of cbp increases relative to pfmb when the polyimide is solely cbpbased the pretilt angle increases to about °  based upon the foregoing disclosure it should now be apparent that the polyimide alignment layers of the present invention will carry out the objects set forth hereinabove it is therefore to be understood that any variations evident fall within the scope of the claimed invention and thus the selection of specific component elements can be determined without departing from the spirit of the invention herein disclosed and described   previous patent novel polyacetal
