current job less than  years in the industry  education bachelor’s degree in hotel and restaurant management with minors in history and finance university of denver favorite way to unwind watching movies with his son cooking with his daughter laughing and spending time with his wife favorite movie or tv show“cinderella man” “big bang theory” “breaking bad” favorite restaurant in another city adelmo’s restaurant dallas type of music he listens to most all types “it is all about the mood and the moment” what energizesinspires him“to watch people develop and reach their potential in whatever they do or want to do always working to make tomorrow a better day than today for my personal and professional family” why did you choose your line of work i loved the dynamic nature of the industry and the ability to meet people from all walks of life and geographic regions hospitality is progressive traditional creative and challenging and it always offers opportunity how do you use social media in relation to your work in my role is it is more monitoring and reactive rather than engaging and connecting with the guests which is really the objective the company has staff dedicated to social media and i am still learning about it — mostly from my kids and the younger generations what do you like best about interacting with the public everything i spend most of my time with the staff to help understand what they need to serve the guests and run the business today we need to make a personal connection on all levels of the business and the associates always make the difference what is your favorite time of year in louisville i have only been in louisville four months which is somewhat limited but i have loved it all thus far the best “time” i have had has been thunder over louisville without a doubt what a great event for the city and a great way to kick off the derby festival what advice would you give to someone who wants to build a career similar to yours you must truly have the “calling” and have a servant’s heart nothing ever replaces hard work being genuine and embracing your individuality but you have to work with the team finally build a solid foundation and culture of service to all while realizing that the associates run the business describe an experience with a customer that was very gratifying to you a group was arriving in naples fla and an attendee had a serious accident on the drive from miami when they arrived at  am they had no car no luggage clothes or cash and had not eaten in hours the staff opened the boutique to get them clothes opened the kitchen and fed the guests and showed amazing care and concern the best part was they did not feel the need to call and ask permission but just took care of the guest the achievement of the team is always the most gratifying part of my job what do you wish more customers understood about the way your business operates that all the associates are really working as hard as they can to make their guest’s stay their event or their meal the best they can possibly can every guest has different expectations and we work as hard as we can to meet all of their needs why is a career in your industry a good choice the hotel business is one of the few industries where we take raw products produce the final product and sell it directly to the consumer guest for final consumption if you are creative or analytical technical or salesdriven a morning or night person the industry offers jobs to every degree i have loved this industry from the day i started as a door host at the ramada inn i
