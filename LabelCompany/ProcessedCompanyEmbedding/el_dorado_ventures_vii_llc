generation termovalle completes mm refinancing september    uncategorized washington dc –dorado power ventures llc a dorado group company completed a mm refinancing of its termovalle power plant on december   dorado power ventures owns  of the mw natural gasfired combined cycle power plant located near the city of cali colombia  the electricity generated from termovalle is dispatched into the colombian wholesale electricity market where the power from the plant provides critical back up to support colombia’s national electricity demand when hydrology levels are low the senior secured loan was completed on a nonrecourse project finance basis and was financed jointly by banco itau of brazil and banco davivienda of colombia   banco de credito de peru subsequently acquired a portion of the loan from banco itau “this refinancing significantly reduced the interest expense and extended the repayment period of termovalle’s debt which in turn provides dorado group companies with greater cash flow for further investments  the refinancing is also a great indication of the sophistication of latin american financial institutions their confidence in the termovalle project dorado’s management and the colombian power sector as a whole” said william kappaz chairman and ceo of dorado group brightscope  advisor pages  find a financial advisor or advisory firm getsearchtypedisplaynamesearchtype
