system to make it easier to access tight areas of the sinus anatomy “the approval of propel contour adds a third product under the propel umbrella expanding our offering of steroid releasing implants to improve surgical outcomes” said lisa earnhardt president and ceo of intersect ent “with its strong clinical evidence we expect that propel contour will extend adoption of our sinus implants both in the operating room as well as in the office and that offering physicians a wide range of products to customize treatment based on their patients’ disease and anatomy will ultimately lead to broader overall usage” positive data from the propel contour cohort of the progress study a prospective randomized blinded multicenter trial of  patients designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the implant when placed in the frontal sinuses following surgery supported the approval the study met its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant  percent relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions such as the need for additional surgical procedures or the need for oral steroid prescription compared to surgery alone “the introduction of propel steroid releasing implants has led to meaningful benefits in how we as surgeons manage our patients especially by reducing our reliance on oral steroids to prevent postoperative complications” said robert weiss md director and founder of ct ent sinus and allergy hearing and balance in norwalk conn and one of the progress study investigators “with propel contour we are able to offer those benefits to a significant range of our chronic sinusitis patients regardless of their unique anatomy and to do so with the comfort of the same rigorous clinical evidence for which the propel family of products is known with this base of solid evidence pointing to a clear benefit there are strong reasons to include propel as part of standard clinical practice”  outlook the company expects to launch propel
