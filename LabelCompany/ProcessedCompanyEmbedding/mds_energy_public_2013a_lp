          implications of being an emerging growth company   the jumpstart our business startups act the “jobs act” became law in april  the partnership is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and it is eligible for certain exemptions from or reduced disclosure obligations relating to various reporting requirements that usually apply to public companies   these exemptions include among others not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act any requirements adopted by the public company accounting oversight board the “pcaob” which require mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor must provide additional information about the audit and the issuer’s financial statements nor with new audit rules adopted by the pcaob after april   unless the sec determines otherwise the partnership has not yet decided whether to use any or all of the exemptions   additionally under section  of the jobs act an “emerging growth company” is eligible for the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  the “act” to comply with new or revised accounting standards this means an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting certain accounting standards until those standards otherwise become applicable to private companies however the partnership is electing to “opt out” of that extended transition period and therefore will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the dates the standards are required for nonemerging growth companies section  of the jobs act provides that the partnership’s decision to opt out of the extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable   the partnership could continue to be an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of     i the last day of the first fiscal year in which it has total annual gross revenue of  billion or more     ii the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of its units pursuant to its prospectus and registration statement with the sec     iii the date that it becomes a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” which would occur if the market value of its units held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million measured as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or     iv the date on which it has during the preceding three year period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt   the partnership anticipates that it will continue to be an emerging growth company until the termination of the five year period described in ii above                part i

to unaudited condensed financial statements   september     note   organization and nature of operations   on may   date of inception mds energy public a lp partnership a delaware limited partnership was formed for the purpose of drilling developmental natural gas wells the partnership has a maximum year term although the partnership intends to terminate when all of the wells invested in by the partnership become uneconomical to continue to operate which may be approximately  years or longer the partnership was formed by mds energy development llc mds a related party as the managing general partner mgp and md gas inc md a related party in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement the mgp is authorized to manage all activities of the partnership and initiates and completes substantially all transactions   in our opinion the accompanying condensed financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the partnership’s financial statements for interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx of the sec accordingly pursuant to such rules and regulations certain notes and other financial information included in audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted the information presented in this quarterly report on form q should be read in conjunction with the partnership’s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its  form k the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year   the mgp on behalf of the partnership intends to apply for deregistration of the partnership with the sec upon issuance of the  form k this is described more here within the accompanying notes   note   summary of significant accounting policies   proved property impairment  the partnership assesses its producing natural gas properties for possible impairment upon a triggering event by comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a well by well basis using estimated production based upon prices at which the partnership reasonably estimates the commodities to be sold  the estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of natural gas  certain events including but not limited to downward revisions in estimates to the partnership’s reserve quantities expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a triggering event and therefore a possible impairment of the partnership’s proved natural gas properties  if net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows the measurement of impairment is based on estimated fair value utilizing a future discounted cash flows analysis which is predominantly unobservable data or inputs and is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed their fair value  estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are determined using prices from the forward price curve at the measurement date  estimated discounted future net cash flows are determined utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate that is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development of the underlying natural gas reserves  due to prices remaining relatively flat from year end  through september   the partnership did not recognize an impairment charge for the third quarter  to it’s proved natural gas properties  the partnership has an impairment charge of proved natural gas properties of approximately  as of september   and december     asset retirement obligations  the partnership applies the provisions of “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” and accounts for asset retirement obligations by recording the fair value of its plugging and abandonment obligations when incurred which is at the time the well is completely drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the partnership increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the asset retirement obligations are accreted over the estimated life of the related asset for the change in their present value the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates escalating retirement costs and changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations   recent accounting pronouncements  in may  the fasb and the international accounting standards board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition that provides a single comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the standard outlines a fivestep approach to apply the underlying principle a identify the contract with the customer b identify the separate performance obligations in the contract c determine the transaction price d allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and e recognize revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied the revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period and can be adopted under the full retrospective method or simplified transition method early adoption is not permitted the partnership plans to adopt the revenue standard beginning january   and is currently evaluating the impact that these changes will have on our condensed financial statements              in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  disclosures of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern new guidance related to the disclosures around going concern the new standard provides guidance around management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the managing general partner is evaluating the income and cash flow statements to determine if a going concern needs to be addressed   in august  the fasb issued an accounting update on statements of cash flows to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows the update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the managing general partner of this partnership is currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on this partnerships financial statements   note   concentration of risk   accounts receivable  this partnership’s accounts receivable are from purchasers of natural gas production the partnership sells substantially all of its gas production to a customer who purchases from other partnerships managed by the partnership’s mgp inherent to the partnership’s industry is the concentration of natural gas sales to a limited number of customers this industry concentration has the potential to impact the partnership’s overall exposure to credit risk in that its customers may be similarly affected by the changes in economic and financial condition commodity prices and other conditions   as of september   and december   the partnership did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts in making the estimate for receivables that are uncollectible the mgp considers among other things subsequent collections historical writeoffs and overall creditworthiness of the
