fund this fund is not suitable for all investors subject to investment risks including possible loss of the principal amount invested derivatives generally are more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments this could result in losses that significantly exceed the funds original investment the following is a description of the principal risks of the funds portfolio that may adversely affect its net asset value and total return there are other circumstances including additional risks that are not described here which could prevent the fund from achieving its investment objective it is important to read all of the disclosure information provided and to understand that you may lose money by investing in the fund commodity risk the funds investments in commodityrelated equities and commoditylinked derivatives may subject the fund to significantly greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and involve substantial risks including risk of a significant portion on their principal value the commodities markets and the prices of various commodities may fluctuate widely based on a variety of factors because the funds performance is linked to the performance of highly volatile commodities investors should consider purchasing shares of the fund only as part of an overall diversified portfolio and should be willing to assume the risks of potentially significant fluctuations in the value of the fund risks of investing in commoditylinked derivatives and leverage risk commoditylinked derivatives are subject to the risk that the market value of the commoditylinked derivative itself or the market value of the underlying instrument will change in a way adverse to the funds interests in addition such instruments may experience potentially dramatic price changes losses and imperfect correlations between the price of the contract and the underlying security or index as a result the fund may incur larger losses or smaller gains than otherwise would be the case if the fund invested directly in the underlying securities a highly liquid secondary market may not exist for certain commoditylinked derivatives and there can be no assurance that one will develop certain derivative transactions may give rise to a form of leverage leverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss leveraging may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements when it may not be advantageous to do so counterparty risk in connection with the funds direct and indirect investments in commoditylinked derivatives the fund will attempt to manage its counterparty exposure so as to limit its exposure to any one counterparty however due to the limited number of entities that may serve as counterparties and which the fund believes are creditworthy at any one time the fund may enter into commoditylinked derivative transactions with a limited number of counterparties or issued by a limited number of issuers that will act as counterparties which may increase the funds exposure to counterparty credit risk diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses an investor should consider the funds investment objectives risks charges and expenses carefully before investing to obtain a prospectus containing
