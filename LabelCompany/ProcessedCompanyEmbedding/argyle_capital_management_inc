philosophy our team our blog newsletter press contact us our blog the rub of a recordlow vix posted on may   tweet this article was also published on realmoney at pm edt on may th  we last posted here in february on the topic of euphoria or at the very least excessive complacency the sp  was about  and the dow about  at the time both indices are about  higher today and the headlines du jour concern the recordlow readings we are seeing in the vix—the “fear index” which measures market expectations for volatility on a  day forwardlooking basis the vix is something that gets mentioned a lot at extremes both low and high it is common for the vix to rise above  when the market is in the midst of a typical correction a reading of  or higher implies a great deal of uncertainty and therefore rising option premiums on the sp  once you get into the  range it’s safe to assume we are closing in on the bottom of a massive correction for some context we got into the s in october of  and the vix remained above  until april of  we all remember what was happening then… below is a chart of the vix going back three years we are below  on the vix as of yesterday’s close  a single digit vix reading is very rare and while many market pundits are pointing to data sets which show that a high vix is a much more reliable indicator—meaning a high vix reading can reliably provide for good low entry points for buying stocks but a low vix reading does not necessarily mean a market drop is around the corner one thing a low vix almost certainly doesn’t mean however is that large gains should be expected for the broad indices in fact we’ve had a sub reading on the vix on nine separate occasions since  every single one was followed by negative returns for the sp  over the subsequent  months you can read more about that here many are speculating as to the reason for the persistently low level of volatility especially given the current geopolitical risks in plain sight the federal reserve’s newfound comfort level with raising shortterm interest rates and continued uncertainty about everything eurozone explanations range from the increased popularity of “passive investing” via index funds  etfs the ability for hedge funds to get stock market exposure by shorting volatility—via the vix itself or other vixrelated products—since the two tend to move opposite one another and i’ve even heard some people argue that there are simply no headwinds to the market now and that we are in the early innings of an expansion what i know is that the small caps iwm financials xlf and transports iyt are all considered leading indicators for the broader markets and they are all signaling trouble small caps financials transports financials were a big postelection story enjoying a tremendous rally on hopes of higher interest rates—either because of increased growth expectations or the fact that president trump has been an outspoken critic of fed chairwoman yellen or both—and also the hopes of deregulation however what we’ve seen instead is a shrinking of the yield spread the differential between shortterm and longterm interest rates it is this margin that drives a great deal of banks’ profits as they borrow on the short end and lend on the long end not only is the picture a bit murky for net interest margins nims but loan growth is also slowing as shown below so yes you’ll see data which demonstrates that the number of loans being issued is at a record high—which is true—but the rate at which they are increasing on a yearoveryear basis is heading towards zero the first derivative is always more useful another postelection narrative that has not played out has been in the energy patch it’s well known that president trump is proenergy and has promised a push towards oil and gas development in an effort to move us towards energy independence unfortunately he cannot control the price of oil after an initial pop energy stocks have given up all of their gains since november th—in fact the only subsector of the energy space that is in positive territory since the election is infrastructure the mlps not everything is as it seems we are increasingly cautious on us stocks and maintain that patience in deploying fresh capital will likely be rewarded have a great rest of your week adam b scott argyle capital partners llc wwwargylecapitalpartnerscom  santa
