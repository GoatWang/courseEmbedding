setting the table so it can run it  allergan plc nyseagn  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»allergans product launches setting the table so it can run itaug  about allergan plc agn open square capital longshort equity value special situations growthopen square capitalsummaryallergans  product launches are critical for its future success four products  to stem generic competition to namenda franchise and  to grow therapeutic franchises stock currently fails to reflect potential of these newly launched products allergan nyseagn reported q results on monday and overall the results were excellent well refrain from commenting on q results as we think sanford bernsteins analyst ronny gal pretty much summed it up when he said a  revenue grower with  free cash flow margin and minimal debt cant continue to trade at x fy  if allergan trades merely at the current overall market multiple the stock is over  we think though that as the market becomes more comfortable with allergan as a stand alone entity the stock will gradually rerate not just to the market multiple but higher we instead wanted to examine allergans product launches for  and refocus on why this years slate of products will set the company up for continued success or challenges ahead checkingin on allergans product launches as you recall allergan today is the result of actavis plc acquiring allergan inc a deal completed on march   much has happened since the merger a year ago a failedpfizer acquisition and the recently completed divestiture of the generic business to teva yet much has stayed the same allergan currently focuses on seven therapeutic areas  eye care  aesthetics dermatology  urology  antiinfective  cns  gi  womens health while there is some slight overlap in a few categories about  of these categories are legacyallergan categories ie supported primarily by products acquired from legacyallergan most of legacyallergans products continue to experience healthy growth allergans dry eye produce restasis will see competition beginning in q but the impact of that competition remains to be seen the remaining  categories bolded cns gi and womens health are largely supported by legacyactavis products and one of them cns has already begun experiencing some weakness moving forward one of our main concerns has been what happens when some of its larger product lines lose marketing exclusivity we think four product launches this year have the potential to shore up weakening topline sales and lay a solid foundation for future growth if allergan can bridge the shortterm gap until its mediumterm pipeline gets approved then shareholders have a much higher probability of seeing many years of doubledigit growth in the shortterm we believe these four  product launches are critical  cns  the namenda franchise and vraylar going forward allergans revenue in the cns space will be supported by botox® migraine the namenda® franchise and vraylar® botox® migraine is growing well but namenda has been a concern a namenda xr® namenda ir® and namzaric® namenda memantine hci is used to treat moderate to severe alzheimer disease and comes in two forms namenda xr a onceaday medication and namenda ir a twicedaily medication namenda ir lost its marketing exclusivity in  and allergan has been transitioning health care providers and patients to namenda xr sales of generic namenda ir however have begun to negatively affect namenda xr sales as health care providers trade convenience for price as you can see below namenda xr sales have begun trending down over the past  quarters source allergan  and  form ks and qs to reverse this trend allergan recently launched namzaric® a combination of namenda xr and aricept last year namzaric recently received an expanded label and the lower dose combination allows patients with moderate to severe alzheimers who are currently stabilized on aricept to start combination therapy directly with namzaric we do not believe the namenda franchise will grow significantly going forward given the generic version of namenda ir a successful launch of namzaric however does mitigate some of this loss and extend sales for the franchise at its current level for a few more years in the second quarter conference call william meury allergans chief commercial officer also alluded to this as he stated i think namzaric could expand the use of combination therapy in the alzheimers category because its superior to namenda xr were going to launch a dtc campaign thats the aim i would say at minimum though its going to shore up this business for the next several years so that we have something thats solidly trading in this  million to  million a year range while the franchise may not grow significantly maintaining a steady state would suffice and allow other products such as vraylar to carry the growth b vraylar® launch vraylar an oral antipsychotic is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar i disorders acute manic or mixed episodes approved in september  and launched in march  vraylar competes in a very competitive market of antipsychotic medications this market is highly genericized but its also highly fragmented which means if vraylar can distinguish itself and expand its label ie to treat additional indications the drug could become very successful vraylars reasonable safety profile lower rates of somnolence ie sleepiness and weightmetabolic factors means it has a good chance of becoming a key part of a doctors treatment options even if vraylar were to simply match the rampup of other antipsychotics this could be potentially a b peak year sales product in  years allergan is currently conducting clinical trials to expand the drug into new uses and categories treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia antidepressant therapy in depression and bipolar i depression treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is particularly promising as there is a highunmet medical need as no products are currently approved to treat this medical condition people diagnosed with schizophrenia usually experience a combination of positive ie hallucinations delusions racing thoughts and negative ie apathy lack of emotion poor or nonexistent social functioning symptom negative symptoms are much more difficult to treat as they persist longer and drastically affect the quality of life the company is currently in discussions with the fda to design a study for clinical trials if approved this has the potential to increase sales by another b average peak year sales for antipsychotic medications with several approved indications are over b as it stands vraylars recent launch has been a success and in comparison to its competitors latuda and rexulti with consensus peak sales of b and b respectively this bodes well for allergans future  gi  viberzi® in the gi space allergans recent launch of viberzi should be closely watched viberzi is an oral medication used to help control diarrhea and abdominal pain for patients with irritable bowel syndrome ibsd the company already markets linzess® which treats constipation and abdominal pains in patients with ibs ibsc consequently the company can leverage its existing knowledge of doctors and health care providers to launch viberzi viberzis main weakness is that its main competitor is xifaxan which is sold by valeant after it acquired salix pharmaceuticals xifaxan has a better safety profile as it has no drug interactions or potential safety concerns whereas viberzi is an opioidr agonistantagonist with the possibility of drug interaction and addiction these factors means doctors will likely prescribe xifaxan first and then potentially viberzi after nevertheless viberzi is a good complement to linzess and allows allergans sales force to call on specialists with two ibs products viberzi was launched in december  and directtoconsumer marketing has only recently begun so wed expect the sales rampup to start shortly if it approaches even half of what the consensus analysts believe xifaxan will do b by  viberzi could be a b peak year sales product  kybella® kybella also known as belkyra outside the us is an injectable drug that over a series of sessions reduces the fat layer in the chin ie doublechins the deoxycholic acid in kybella destroys the fat cell membranes and the body naturally absorbs the fat the treatment costs approximately  and takes  sessions separated by  weeks in  there were over  neck lift procedures and over  facelift procedures american academy of plastic surgeons given kybella is much less invasive we believe it has the opportunity to exceed neck lift procedures moreover kybella has the possibility of expanding its label and be marketed in the aesthetic fat sculpting market beyond chin fat zeltiq nasdaqzltq is the main competitor in this space with the coolmini device which freezes fat cells kybella however allows trained physicians to tailor the treatment to the individual and achieve longer lasting results the slight swelling and more invasive nature of kybella injections vs freezing machine is offset by its longerlasting effect as the dtc campaign takes effect we believe sales volume will increase dramatically setting the stage for growth so thats how we see it four critical products to focus on going forward one namzaric to stabilize the namenda franchise and counter generic sales erosion and three vraylar viberzi and kybella all with b potential each to drive organic growth its fair to say that all four products have potentially significant upside and that allergans share price today fails to reflect this optionality or the optionality of additional ma and inlicensing for that matter nevertheless the market has a habit of paying attention when companies begin delivering outsized growth and throwing off an obscene amount of cash and we think thats the case here in the meantime well keep accumulating at these prices

of the call for this quarter and excited about having you leading our investor relations and corporate strategy functions welcome  is all about execution we are well positioned to deliver compelling growth through effective execution in this pivotal year so why do we call  a pivotal year whereas  was a year of transformation for allergan  is the first full year of operating as a dedicated branded biopharma company and it is pivotal for setting the foundation for sustained high performance and strong shareholder return in  we are focused on driving revenue growth despite the impact from generic entries on some key products in  we are expanding medical aesthetics into regenerative medicine and body sculpting through the accretive acquisitions of lifecell and zeltiq  is the first full year of significant direct competition to restasis one of our major growth drivers and six months into that launch we are in a strong position and back on offense with two of our own product launches  is a big launch year we have  launches that we think could combine to generate up to  billion in peak sales including vraylar viberzi kybella and two novel devices truetear for dry eye and xen for glaucoma in diseases traditionally dominated by medicines  is a year that our teams will advance each of our six stars into phase  in  we will extend our rd into adjacencies like nash parkinsons disease and gene therapy for blindness and other eye conditions in  we will finish the accelerated stock repurchase program and as you know we have already paid our firstever dividend on our ordinary shares and then  is our first full year operating under a social contract in a world of intense pricing scrutiny im very confident in the team we have assembled at all levels of our company i know we can do all those things and do them exceedingly well our ability to perform well in  will set the foundation for success in   and beyond that is why  is a pivotal year for our company turning to slide  we are out of the gate with a solid first quarter revenues were up  right on track with our plan with great performance from medical aesthetics eye care womens health cns partially offset by continued erosion of namenda xr and generic entries for asacol hd and minastrin in addition as anticipated this quarter was negatively impacted by yearoveryear trade buying patterns gross margins remain above  due to product mix and efforts we undertook in the quarter to buy back some royalty streams from partners while operating margin was lower due to our seasonally lower sales in q and investment in rd and sales and marketing we expect the operating margin to improve as revenue grows during the remainder of the year in the first quarter the increased operating spend and higher tax rate were offset by share count reduction netting out to doubledigit increase in performance net income per share were very proud to see the rd pipeline is really humming key programs like atogepant and rapastinel are rolling ahead of plan and we completed phase  enrollment of abicipar for amd we have started screening patients in the cvc cenicriviroc phase  trial and announced a collaboration to study cvc in combination with novartiss fxr inhibitor for nash we announced very robust data from esmyas second pivotal us trial and plan to file in the second half this year botox depression data was encouraging and david will touch on that during his remarks sarecycline met its endpoint in its second pivotal trial and we have added more high science projects to our pipeline with deals like crispr technology for eye diseases we also closed lifecell in early february and zeltiq on april  just in time for the aesthetic plastic surgery meeting in san diego i attended this meeting and had an opportunity to meet with many of the top plastic surgeons from around the world we used this event as an opportunity to announce the coolsculpting acquisition to our customers with an expanding and commanding presence our colleagues from allergan and our new colleagues from lifecell and zeltiq worked in tandem to drive home the message that allergan is the goto company in the medical aesthetics and regenerative medicine world we were the talk of the show with this very important customer base and we are allin when it comes to fueling growth and innovation in medical aesthetics theres a long runway for this business and we want to be the face of medical aesthetics and regenerative medicine in closing we had a solid quarter and are off to a good start in this pivotal year now let me hand the call over to bill william j meury  allergan plc thanks brent and good morning everyone turning to slide  this quarter we had solid commercial performance reflecting the underlying durability of our business revenue was up  our top products which account for approximately  of our sales were up  versus prior year based mostly on volume formulary coverage this year is strong across the entire portfolio in  we have four key themes first were fueling the growth of medical aesthetics with the addition of alloderm and coolsculpting next were focused on maintaining eye care leadership with restasis and new product introductions third were driving new product launches in gi and cns and finally we expect to grow our international business at doubledigit rates turning to slide  you can see the key themes reflected in our growth this quarter overall this is a highquality and balanced portfolio in medical aesthetics sales were driven by botox cosmetic up  and our juvéderm collection of fillers up  in eye care restasis showed durability with an increase of  million up  versus prior year collectively our new products vraylar namzaric kybella and viberzi contributed  million to net revenue growth growth was partially offset by sales erosion from namenda xr and loss of exclusivity mainly from asacol hd and minastrin turning to slide  with the acquisitions of lifecell and zeltiq medical aesthetics is our largest and fastest growing business what we have here today is the broadest and deepest product line in one of the hottest areas in all of healthcare and its built on three pillars facial aesthetics plastics and regenerative medicine and body contouring in q medical aesthetics grew  excluding foreign exchange including two months of lifecell and now with the addition of zeltiq we expect it to be one of the fastestgrowing areas of our business in  and beyond as you can see on the slide consumer penetration rates are low  in facial aesthetics  in plastics and regenerative medicine and  in body contouring were really just scratching the surface here attitudes toward aesthetics are changing and there are two trends driving market expansion the first is a youth movement with the  to yearold segment expanding rapidly the second is a male movement with more interest by men in aesthetic procedures and we expect these trends to accelerate over time on facial aesthetics we launched two new juvéderm collection fillers in the past year for the mid to low face volbella a lip enhancer and vollure for moderate to severe wrinkles and folds we now have the broadest and most comprehensive line of fillers of any aesthetics company kybella continues to be a work in progress as we focus on developing the market through three activities training more injectors shifting to a procedure sell and copositioning with coolmini we expect kybella will be a bigger contributor over time the addition of alloderm has fueled the positive momentum in breast implants this new combined platform consisting of regenerative medicines and plastics is exceeding our expectations and regarding body contouring were getting very positive feedback from our customers on coolsculpting they love the technology and we see significant opportunities for revenue synergies with our facial aesthetics business turning to eye care on slide  lets start with dry eye in the first quarter restasis has proven again to be a durable business even in the face of a new entrant the market is approximately  larger today than it was a year ago and weve maintained a leading position with more than  share after just one month of promotion restasis mdpf accounts for approximately  of new restasis prescriptions and roughly half of these prescriptions were for patients new to restasis truetear which is approved and is a handheld device that produces a natural tear on demand which includes all three layers of the tear film we believe truetear is highly complementary to restasis this launch will be rolled out in stages between now and  turning to slide  no company offers as many treatment options for glaucoma patients as allergan the xen gel stent which launched in the us in q is the first step to transforming our glaucoma product line xen provides significant iop reductions and can be used with or without cataract surgery an advantage over other options because its a surgical procedure the adoption curve for xen is different than for traditional pharmaceuticals were making an investment in training and reimbursement this year and we expect to see significantly more sales in  and beyond in retina ozurdex continues its strong growth in the us at  and outside the us at  excluding exchange turning to our launch products in cns on slide  demand for vraylar remains strong and above expectations its currently the fastestgrowing atypical antipsychotic on the market outlook for the product is excellent vraylar has a long patent life to  and we see potential for several highvalue future indications which we believe will be sales accelerators were expecting to roll out a consumer campaign targeted at the bipolar mania audience in the middle of the year with namzaric sales are primarily coming from an increased use of combination therapy by neurologists with patients transitioning from monotherapy aricept to namzaric which is the largest part of the market at the current rate we expect namzaric to be annualizing at approximately  of the namenda franchise by the end of  we have good formulary coverage for the balance of the year and we expect it to be strong as we look ahead to  turning to gi on slide  the first quarter was highlighted by the launch of a new microgram dose of linzess which expands the dosing options for physicians and should drive conversion of mild to moderate otc users the new low dose is off to a strong start with approximately  of patients new to linzess overall prescription demand is up  in the quarter linzess sales were up  in the quarter impacted by trade buying patterns on viberzi the label was changed and is now contraindicated in patients without a gall bladder the best way to think about the impact is a onetime step down in demand of approximately  to  the outlook here is still positive ibsd is a big market the unmet need is high and viberzi works on multiple dimensions of ibsd which no overthecounter does and satisfaction rates are high relative to antispasmodics and antidiarrheals we expect sales trends to begin to normalize in the second half of the year turning to slide  and our international business sales increased  this quarter excluding fx in our international markets were seeing operational growth in every single region with asiapacific and latin americacanada each growing at approximately  in the quarter china is our fastest growing country up  mostly driven by the aesthetics business medical aesthetics and eye care anchor our business internationally in medical aesthetics the business is powered by botox cosmetic and our juvéderm collection of fillers while eye care is driven by ozurdex and optive our overthecounter tear across our business our continued focus is on execution were well positioned both inside the united states and internationally to drive volume and market share to continue making progress on new product launches and to maintain strong formulary coverage with that ill turn the call over to david c david nicholson  allergan plc thank you bill good morning everyone turning to slide  in the first quarter and this year we continue to make great progress in building and delivering allergans pipeline to patients we enhanced our gene therapy pipeline and entered gene editing through an alliance with editas medicine to develop five ocular programs which may include their preclinical lead lca program with our acquisition of lifecell we are advancing innovation in regenerative medicine with programs in fat grafting breast reconstruction and abdominal wall repair were excited to add zeltiq technology and their pipeline to our rd efforts our nash collaboration with novartis will combine cvc with an advanced fxr agonist this collaboration will certainly accelerate our understanding of this combination in nash now delivering the pipeline so far this year weve made significant progress weve achieved eight major pharma and device approvals including rhofade for rosacea linzess micrograms for ibsd and cic truetear for dry eye and vollure for nasolabial folds and we submitted seven programs for review by the major regulatory authorities including vraylar for schizophrenia maintenance a multidose preservativefree formulation of ganfort for glaucoma in europe as well as additional indications for our breast implants and fillers together with our partner amgen we filed for approval of a biosimilar to herceptin in the eu turning to slide  we are focused on delivering innovation for patients while we continued to advance all of our programs in development im going to focus on our six stars in cns recruitment in phase  for ubrogepant and phase b for atogepant in migraine is ahead of expectations we expect to have top line results from both programs in the first half of  we continue to work with the fda and if successful these will be the first oral cgrp antagonists to be approved and available for the treatment of migraine our phase  program for rapastinel is ahead of schedule and we expect to have top line results for the shortterm studies in  as a reminder rapastinel could be a real gamechanger treatment for mdd a condition that desperately needs innovation in womens health following the positive phase  results for esmya we expect to submit an nda for intermittent treatment of uterine fibroids in the second half of  in eye care we have completed enrollment in both phase  studies for our amd abicipar program and we expect to announce top line results from these trials in  and in gi we have initiated screening in our phase  program for cvc for nash and we are preparing to begin phase  development of relamorelin our ghrelin agonist for diabetic gastroparesis in the second half of this year turning to slide  we recently announced the results from our phase  study for botox in major depressive disorder mdd the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single administration of two different doses of botox  and  units relative to placebo in adult females with mdd the results compared to placebo are shown on the left side of the slide the unit dose demonstrated numerically superior efficacy on madrs total score we saw placeboadjusted effects between  and  which is consistent with data from clinical trials of ssris and snris separation from placebo was consistent and observed across multiple other therapeutic measures administration of the unit dose resulted in a very similar reduction in total madrs as the unit does however the difference in score for the unit dose was not greater than that of its own placebo group its notoriously difficult in clinical trials in depression to always show a placebo drug difference for a trial to be fail or negative is a frequent occurrence based on this trial evidence from the physiciansponsored studies and reports from the field we feel that depending upon feedback from regulatory authorities we should continue to investigate our toxin program in depression treatment with botox was very well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified adverse events typically associated with antidepressants such as sexual dysfunction metabolic changes and drugdrug interactions were not observed in great rates in placebo turning to slide  together with our partner paratek we have announced the results from phase  studies of sarecycline an antibiotic for the potential treatment of moderate to severe acne both trials met their week primary efficacy endpoints of acne score and lesion count the positive results obtained in the phase  trials show sarecycline to be an effective safe treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acne based on these data we plan to file an nda with the fda in the second half of this year as i have outlined weve made significant progress in building and delivering our pipeline we have many rd milestones this year and we are well on our way to delivering we remain confident that our open science approach delivers real value to patients as always i thank our global rd team for their continued focus in advancing innovation and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve now i will turn the call over to tessa tessa maria teresa hilado  allergan plc thank you david good morning everyone turning to our overall results for the first quarter of  on slide  in q we delivered solid yearoveryear performance nongaap continuing operations net revenues were  billion a  increase versus prior year primarily driven by continued strong growth in key brands new launches and the addition of lifecell as bill mentioned the growth was partially offset by loes and namenda xr decline in addition and as anticipated sales were negatively impacted year over year by trade buying patterns nongaap gross margins for the first quarter remained strong at  which included the negative impact from lifecell lower gross margin and the positive impact from product mix as well as royalty buyouts of certain products during the quarter nongaap operating margin was  in the first quarter of  a decline of  basis points versus prioryear period as a result of one a lower quarter in sales as previously mentioned two higher rd investment to support advancements of the pipeline three increased sales and marketing investments to continue to support new launches and the addition of lifecell and lastly increased ga expenses primarily due to the addition of lifecell note that sequentially ga declined by  million as we expect sales to increase in the subsequent quarters and sga expenses are expected to be lower in the back half of the year we expect operating margins to improve performance net income per share of  reflects growth of  versus prior year driven by revenue growth lower net interest expense and share count reduction and partially offset by a higher tax rate and lower operating margins our nongaap tax rate was  in the quarter cash flow from operations for the first quarter was approximately  million excluding rd asset acquisitions and restructuring payments adjusted cash flow from operations remained strong at  billion our gaap financial metrics and reconciliation from gaap to nongaap metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website turning now to our q performance by segment results on slide  us specialized therapeutics revenues were  billion for the quarter continuing strong doubledigit growth of  versus the prioryear period driven by exceptional growth across facial aesthetics of  and botox therapeutic of  as well as eye care growth of  in our us general medicine business first quarter revenues were  billion a decline of  versus prior year growth from our key products along with new product launches was more than offset by the losses of exclusivity of asacol hd and minastrin lower namenda xr revenues as well as yearoveryear impact of trade buying patterns international first quarter revenues were  million representing  growth versus prior year excluding fx growth was driven mainly by medical aesthetics and eye care as bill mentioned growth was seen across all the regions looking at segment contribution margin us specialized therapeutics is the highest margin segment mainly attributed to strong gross margins the decline of  basis points versus last year was mostly due to the addition of lifecell an increase in promotion for kybella and eye care and dermatology businesses us general medicine contribution margin declined this quarter versus prior year due to the decline in revenues as explained before and higher promotional spend to support new product launches partially offset by royalty buyouts international showed slight improvement in contribution margins from  to  as revenues continued to grow double digits turning to slide  we ended the year sic quarter  in a strong capital position with total debt of approximately  billion and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of  times we reduced our total debt by  billion in the first quarter and expect to continue to repay our contractual maturities which will further reduce debt by an additional  billion over  and  post first quarter  we paid  million in debt ahead of its june maturity schedule turning to slide  we are raising our  guidance to primarily reflect the zeltiq acquisition note that our prior guidance already reflected the addition of lifecell which closed on february   we continue to be committed to managing operating expenses as we continue to invest behind the progression of the pipeline and new product launches with the addition of zeltiq as of april   we now expect fullyear  branded revenues to be between  billion to  billion which reflects high singledigit growth versus last year other revenue assumptions remain unchanged such as one we continue to expect namenda xr generic competition in early fourth quarter two stable revenues of restasis three we have not anticipated generic competition for estrace for the remainder of the year and lastly our annual guidance reflects a potential negative foreign exchange impact of approximately  million our gross margins are expected to remain between  to  consistent with our expectation that gross margin will be impacted by product mix as partner products such as linzess and vraylar experience strong growth the loss of exclusivity in march of minastrin which is a highmargin product lower gross margins for lifecell and zeltiq products and the impact from the royalty buyouts for certain products our updated nongaap sga guidance of  billion to  billion reflects the incremental sga from the zeltiq acquisition we expect minimal synergy capture for zeltiq this year as we focus on expanding our footprint in body contouring as a third pillar in our medical aesthetics business we now expect nongaap rd spend of approximately  billion an increase versus prior guidance as we experience faster patient enrollment in ubrogepant and rapastinel as well as expected faster enrollment for cvc low rd program attrition rates and the addition of zeltiq rd we are encouraged by these developments and the updated rd guidance reflects support for our  projects including important advancements of our six stars we continue to expect rd to be fairly evenly spread throughout the year our tax rate for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately  net interest expense other of approximately  billion remains unchanged and will be backhalf weighted as other income in the first two quarters of the year includes dividend income from teva in addition q net interest expense is expected to be higher relative to q as a result of lower cash balances due to acquisitions average  share count remains unchanged at approximately  million shares and assumes a q or earlier settlement for the asr as a result we now expect full year  nongaap performance net income per share to be in the range of  to  reflecting strong doubledigit growth in the range of  to  now given the addition of zeltiq in the middle of the quarter we wanted to also provide you with some perspective for the second quarter of  for the second quarter we expect total reported revenue of approximately  billion to  billion we also expect sga spend to be somewhat higher in q compared to the remainder of the year due to continued strong promotion of key brands the addition of zeltiq and the launch of rhofade we are on track for a strong  with that ill turn the call over to brent for some closing remarks brenton l saunders  allergan plc thank you tessa in closing were off to a solid start im proud that we are executing in all areas of our business sales are up  performance net income per share is up  this good financial execution allowed us to increase investment in product promotion and importantly it allowed us to increase investment in rd to accelerate development of our six stars with the addition of coolsculpting we are raising our top line and bottom line expectations for  and we are driving effective execution in this pivotal year for our company melissa were now ready to begin the qa questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of chris schott jpmorgan christopher schott  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks so much for the questions just two here maybe first can you just talk a little bit about the ibs competitive landscape for both linzess and for vz viberzi with incremental investment from one of your competitors a new player in the market and maybe a second part of that is with for vz with the label change is there any concern that this label change could impact the broader physician view of the product just given its not as clean as the profile had been initially my second question was just on business development youve obviously been very active over the last six to nine months or so but when you look at the current franchises and some of the recent acquisitions and pipeline deals where do you see the biggest opportunity to continue to build out the portfolio via external transactions at this point thanks so much brenton l saunders  allergan plc thanks chris maybe ill take the bd question and then turn the ibs questions over to bill on the bd front we remain very active and plugged into the global marketplace i think our strategy essentially is unchanged as we continue to look at steppingstone transactions to support our current seven therapeutic areas and i think a good bookend of types of deals are the ones we just recently did zeltiq on one end as an accretive going concern that is a plugin right into our medical aesthetics business strong strategic logic and accretive with good revenue synergies for the long term to doing a deal with editas for our ability to get into the crispr space and gene editing in eye disease so those are the way we think about business development as i look where we tend to focus are on the big four which is medical aestheticsdermatology eye care cns and gi and thats where we tend to spend most of our time but were always interested in womens health antiinfectives hospital platform as well as urology bill do you want to take ibs william j meury  allergan plc yes ill start with linzess the first comment i would make from a pure demand perspective we had a great quarter with prescriptions up  if you step back and think about the market and activity by other companies what i go to is the fact that we have a threedose product with two indications we have promotional leadership i dont think thats going to be challenged we have formulary coverage thats taken us – lets face it – three or four years to develop and so i see this as a very reliable doubledigit sales stream for ibsc and cic for the next several years beyond the core indications as you know were developing with ironwood a delayedrelease or colonic formulation of linzess which could be considered a nextgeneration linzess we still have to do the work to be fair and we have a patent till  and maybe beyond if you look at other patents and formulations and so this is a great business right now and were focused on what we can control and that is the promotion of the product and the customers and i dont see anything in the market thats going to disrupt this business thats one of the advantages of having a leadership position and incumbency as it relates to viberzi i think that the past four weeks have been very reassuring weve seen a rebound in prescriptions i expect that the growth rate will normalize in the second half of the year what im most encouraged by is that satisfaction rates for viberzi for ibsd are as high as they are for any product that we have theres going to be a onetime step down in demand which i talked about during the remarks its the only product that works on both aspects of ibsd pain and diarrhea thats an advantage relative to the otcs its a very very big market and i think the best opportunity for growth going forward is going to be with the primary care segment which accounts for  of our prescriber base and so we hit a speed bump but fundamentally this is still a very very good business and should produce meaningful growth in the future thats how i think about it brenton l saunders  allergan plc melissa next question operator and our next question comes from the line of ken cacciatore cowen  company ken cacciatore  cowen  co llc hi good morning everyone just a question on restasis brent you have the ipr inter partes review challenge coming up in december and i know theres litigation in the federal courts can you just update us on the settlements to date and how youre viewing this challenge going forward is there any discussions with others and then second question just wanted to understand the dividend strategy going forward can you articulate or can you give us a sense of when youll articulate a growth strategy on the dividend thank you brenton l saunders  allergan plc yes so ill take the shorter answer first which is the dividend we are committed to our dividend and annual increase – annually increasing our dividend at obviously the discretion of our board of directors but something were absolutely committed to and its year one and we anticipate an increase next year with respect to the restasis ipr and the federal court case bob bailey our general counsel is here maybe ill ask him to just provide a little detail or color on our position although we believe we are in a strong position here ambrose robert douglas bailey  allergan plc great thanks brent so on restasis we have two matters that are coming up in august we have the hearing on the ipr and we also have the trial in the court in texas we anticipate decisions in both of those in the november to december timeframe so just from a timing perspective to lay that out there any decision on appeal would likely come about a year after that so we think about a worstcase scenario in the  – early  timeframe under a worstcase scenario we do have and we continue to have six issued patents covering the product we do have confidence in our ip portfolio there and continue to defend that and assert that in both matters another thing worth noting is that approval of a generic restasis is not a given the approval pathway has been defined in part but not in whole by the fda they did issue the bioequivalence guidance a couple of years ago it does not include specific direction and to date there is no specific direction on the testing required to determine whether or not the product meets the seven physiochemical properties that have been identified by the fda and so as a result we recognize that there are multiple shots on goal here to be able to hold off generic competition brenton l saunders  allergan plc anything else ken ken cacciatore  cowen  co llc no thank you brenton l saunders  allergan plc great melissa next question operator our next question comes from the line of jami rubin goldman sachs jami rubin  goldman sachs  co thank you just a few questions here brent maybe to you on the margins if i take the midpoint of your margin guidance this year im getting about – just a little above  which is down from  last year and some of that too is mix zeltiq is a lower margin business but also its based on increased promotional spend how should i think about that margin going forward and i guess a bigger picture question is you have seven therapeutic areas many of which are large primary care focus and it just seems counterintuitive to have industryleading margins and just if you can explain should we assume that you can maintain those industryleading plus  operating margins because i think when i look at street models the street is assuming that margins continue to improve year after year after year so if you could address that please that would be very helpful and then secondly a question for you tessa is on your free cash flow i think you had said your adjusted cash flow this quarter was  billion and if memory serves me right i think on previous calls you have talked about  billion to  billion in cash flow every quarter was wondering if there are any onetimers should we expect a stronger second half in terms of cash flow but if you could talk about why the slight shortfall thanks very much brenton l saunders  allergan plc yes so thank you jami ill turn frankly both questions over to tessa but just i would say with respect to margins and maintaining a capability in primary care i think arguably we do the most calls in primary care in our industry so we have the most productive primary care field force our entire strategy in the united states is predicated in large part on having the ability to do both specialty and primary care and thats been important for drugs like linzess bystolic viberzi and we anticipate other opportunities in our pipeline to leverage that capability remember why we can do volume over price is in large part because volume is in primary care even though adoption in trials generally is in specialty and so being able to participate in both parts of that market is strategically critical to our business model and future strategy with respect to the margins themselves tessa do you want to provide some color for jami maria teresa hilado  allergan plc good morning jami so youre absolutely right were posting based on the midpoint of guidance a lower margin at  but you have to note that this year we obviously added lifecell and zeltiq which are accretive businesses but posting lower both gross margins and operating margins and despite that weve been able to maintain our operating margins at the high of  we did not change our guidance at all from our prior guidance with the exception of adding zeltiq in the mix sga over time will create leverage there as sales increase as well and were not giving guidance for  obviously but i would say that were very pleased with  even despite the fact that we added lowermargin business such as lifecell and zeltiq on free cash flow for the quarter the really main adjustment to that are the three asset acquisitions that we did which is editas assembly and lti as you know so if you add that back thats about  billion in operating cash flow for the quarter note also that q is the lowest revenue quarter as we noted and combined with sga and rd being relatively stable throughout the quarters that really poses lower earnings as well and lower cash flow from an expectation standpoint we expect to post operating cash flow – adjusted operating cash flow of about  billion to  billion in the second half of the year absent any additional acquisitions obviously does that help jami jami rubin  goldman sachs  co yes it does thank you very much brenton l saunders  allergan plc great next question melissa operator our next question comes from the line of david risinger morgan stanley david r risinger  morgan stanley  co llc thanks very much so i have two questions first for brent could you talk about the latest on us pricing from a trump administration standpoint just the latest that youre hearing any next steps or dialogue with industry leaders that you expect in the near term and if you could also comment on the opportunity for the pharma industry to drive toward pointofsale rebates to reduce the sticker shock that many us patients experience when they get to the pharmacy im hoping that you could maybe frame for us how you see that playing out over time obviously the payers and pbms may not be interested in that but it would certainly be a solution that the pharma industry is already advocating for and that the trump administration may find as a solution to lower prices for consumers at the point of sale and then tessa could you just provide a little bit more color on the second quarter of  outlook sequentially so specifically how we should think about the gross margin versus the first quarter that you just reported and the sga in the second quarter versus the first quarter thank you brenton l saunders  allergan plc so i think with respect to pricing today i think – and ive been saying this i think for over a year – we have to just get used to the fact that we live in a quick trigger twitter world today i know a lot of people got upset with me when i said that presidentelect trump was going to be worse on twitter than hillary i think thats proven out to be correct he will tweet in the moment and so weve got to get used to that kind of dialogue i think that being said though the discussion around pricing within the administration and within the industry i think is very rational and levelheaded i think that what youre seeing in the mainstream biopharma industry is a much more focused disciplined approach to pricing and access to important medicines and in fact this morning sanofi joined the club of companies making a pledge to responsibly price their medicines along with us and companies like novo nordisk and abbvie and jj and some others so that group is growing and im pleased to see that happening i think with respect to the pointofsale rebate that is an important issue i think ultimately in part why the price of medicines gets such a disproportionate share of voice in terms of the cost of healthcare in perspective to hospital care or doctors or diagnostics or the other longterm care is because you have to actually pay for your medicines at the pharmacy counter in order to receive them and when you have to pay your deductible particularly in the first quarter which is the seasonality you see at allergan and many other pharmaceutical companies a lot of patients walk away from their prescriptions as a result and thats not what we want and thats not whats good for any healthcare system i think youre seeing a lot of discussion and we are going to continue to discuss with policymakers even this week how to extend pointofsale rebates to patients there are some private solutions that are already underway express scripts recently announced some programs on some medicines to do just that as well so my sense david is over the course of this year whether through private market solution or policy intervention were going to solve the patient pointofsale rebate issue and pricing issue which really will affect potentially positively first quarter next year because we do see such a strong seasonality during the highdeductible season of q so netnet i were moving in a constructive positive way and i think the industry is moving in a constructive positive way so im cautiously optimistic on the pricing environment maria teresa hilado  allergan plc david on your question with regards to how to think about the quarter revenue sequentially will obviously be higher weve guided you to  billion to  billion q we posted a little bit north of  billion and we explained the reason why gross margin just to guide you for the second quarter will be lower than q really largely due to product mix two things to note full quarter for lifecell two quarters of zeltiq in q which as you know has lower gross margins and then also note that minastrin its the first full quarter of minastrin going generic as we also mentioned on the script earlier sga will be higher than our other quarters largely due to promotion of key brands and the launch of rhofade however operating margins will actually start to trend higher versus q largely because of higher revenue and then i also mentioned that interest expense will be higher in q david r risinger  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you brenton l saunders  allergan plc thanks dave operator our next question comes from the line of ronny gal bernstein aaron gal  sanford c bernstein  co llc good morning and thank you for taking my questions two one on just a couple of the generic risks maybe to bob youre modeling estrace for the full year can you just give us the basis for this obviously mylan said on their analyst day that they think they can launch this year and similar on restasis historically generics launch on district court decision not on appeal decision can you just give us an idea why youre assuming that in this particular case they will wait for the appeal and second shifting over to the pipeline program i noticed youve got a very large phase  program for the longacting anticgrp about  patients but you havent started a second trial and you call it a phase  can you just give us a feel for what is the duration of that plan and why youve done this very large phase  as opposed to a couple of phase  programs as long as youre doing it why not do just two big trials and have the drug to come to market earlier brenton l saunders  allergan plc okay so rob stewart do you want to answer the estrace robert a stewart  allergan plc sure hey ronny with estrace weve obviously been monitoring what mylan has said they did indicate that they were going to launch estrace as well as i think generic advair and vytorin i dont think any of those have happened yet so we continue to keep our ear close to the ground on this one from our standpoint we have prepared to launch an authorized generic in the event that mylan does get approval and launch our assumption at this point in our forecast is that they are not going to launch this year ill just keep it at that but if they do we are prepared to launch an authorized generic with them brenton l saunders  allergan plc and obviously if we hear something different well update the market accordingly i think with respect to the district court versus appellate court launch for a potential generic restasis bill do you just want to just provide a little color william j meury  allergan plc yes ronny happy to comment on that youre right that there is the potential for a launch atrisk scenario there are a couple of factors that could mitigate  against that the biggest of which is that this is a large product and the significant potential damage exposure not that that would dissuade some of the generic competitors but its certainly a factor the second factor is that we see injunctions granted pending appeal in the majority of cases involving products of this magnitude where theres a sole product in the market as we have here brenton l saunders  allergan plc and then the third point i would make is someone actually has to get an approved product william j meury  allergan plc correct brenton l saunders  allergan plc which i think provides three points for that rationale on timing aaron gal  sanford c bernstein  co llc is it safe to say the settlements you have theres an acceleration clause so if somebody does launch you will not get the benefit of a full launch because whoever you settle with will be able to launch at the same time brenton l saunders  allergan plc thats hypothetically how you should think about these things aaron gal  sanford c bernstein  co llc thanks brenton l saunders  allergan plc and with respect to ubrogepant do you want to talk about that david c david nicholson  allergan plc sure happy to hi ronny yes so cgrps obviously weve got two of them ubrogepant where we are in the middle of two phase  studies now for atogepant were running a phase b study because first of all we need to identify the optimal dose so we set it up as a phase b trial as you know the fda obviously requires two adequate and wellcontrolled studies we believe that this phase b trial whatever you want to call it could be one of the two adequate and wellcontrolled studies that wed need to get approval depending on how the data pans out which would mean we would just need to run one additional phase  study once weve identified the right dose thats our strategy aaron gal  sanford c bernstein  co llc got it thanks brenton l saunders  allergan plc thanks ronny melissa operator our next question comes from the line of david mars sic maris  wells fargo david maris  wells fargo securities llc i think im from mars but its maris so on fillers brenton l saunders  allergan plc you said it not us david maris  wells fargo securities llc exactly so on fillers it seems to be a really great story from what weve seen this is being driven only by a little bit of younger patients or men but far more from your traditional target market does that coincide with what youre seeing in the market and how penetrated is botox and fillers versus the potential market and then separately on abicipar when in  do you expect having that top line data brenton l saunders  allergan plc so with respect to fillers ill ask bill to provide some color but as you think about the juvéderm family or collection of fillers we have which bill mentioned is the broadest and deepest portfolio of fillers in the industry the growth there close to  for the quarter was really highquality growth across the entire world really and i think its one of the – we talk a lot about botox but we dont talk as much about the juvéderm family which is i think really a significant portion of our facial aesthetics portfolio the demographics are clearly improving the number of injectors are clearly improving but bill do you want to add some more color william j meury  allergan plc yes i think that probably the biggest driver right now is weve been introducing new fillers both in the united states and internationally its part of whats called our vycross line of fillers which is a premiumpriced filler and with those launches we benefit from two outcomes one is increased market share in fact market share for our filler line in the first quarter was up versus the prior quarter and we benefit from a higher asp as it relates to just fillers and how the aesthetics community thinks about it five years ago  years ago it was about lines and wrinkles and if youre at any aesthetic conference anywhere in the world now theyre talking about this concept of facial contouring and so you see that the growth rate in the volume for fillers is actually rivaling that of botox internationally david our filler volume is as high as it is for botox and i think that trend is going to continue and youre right its coming from our core user base the millennial movement i think is a botox phenomenon more than anything else brenton l saunders  allergan plc and then david do you want to comment on the abicipar trial c david nicholson  allergan plc sure yes as we just mentioned we completed enrollment readout is one year from now last patient last visit is one year after that patient was recruited into the study after that we need to close the database check it for no gcp good clinical practice violations crunch the numbers so that takes a few weeks after weve had the last patient and the last visit which is about a year from now so readout after weve been through all of that so sometime in the second half david maris  wells fargo securities llc and then if i can sneak in one followup on biosimilars can you update us on whats pending and what you expect to be in market in the next say two or three years c david nicholson  allergan plc yeah happy to take that together with our partner amgen weve got the avastin biosimilar and the herceptin biosimilar in the works clearly well be working with the regulatory authorities to get those biosimilars approved the actual launch of the biosimilars can only occur once all the patents from the originating companies have expired so whilst weve got for instance avastin submitted and under review the avastin biosimilar launch cannot be expected until the ip has expired does that answer your question david maris  wells fargo securities llc great thank you very much brenton l saunders  allergan plc next question melissa operator your next question comes from the line of umer raffat evercore isi umer raffat  evercore group llc hi thank you so much for taking my question perhaps david first given the history of oral cgrp class with liver tox i guess my question is how confident are you that fda will not require a day continuous dosing study as part of your nda package and is that a trial that you may consider doing at your own volition perhaps and then brent maybe a higherlevel question for you if we were to enter a phase with very large ma in the broader industry how should we be thinking about how allergan will think through what to do or what not to do in an environment like that thank you brenton l saunders  allergan plc david do you want to touch on the oral cgrp c david nicholson  allergan plc sure so weve got two oral cgrps in development as everyone is aware atogepant which is being dosed chronically for the prophylaxis of migraine and then weve got ubrogepant which is for the acute treatment of migraine the present clinical study with ubrogepant looks at the agent for up to eight migraine attacks a month and each migraine attack can be treated for two days so ubrogepant at the moment can be given in that study maximally  days a month now i am as confident as i can be that we have liversafe compounds in comparison to the originator molecules ubrogepant and atogepant are much more potent so the daily body burden is much less than with the originator molecules we believe we have an understanding of why the originator molecules were toxic we have simulations showing the degeneration of chemically reactive intermediates during the metabolism of those originator molecules ubrogepant and atogepant have a lower propensity to induce the formation of – or to have the formation of these reactive intermediates if we peel back the onion even more we do feel we understand the mechanism of the liver toxicity of these reactive intermediates which seem to be due to attenuation of mitochondrial respiration as well as modulation of bile salt extrusion pumps so we really start to understand things we are of course in discussions with the agency about the package of information that we need for submission for ubrogepant and well sort out whether we need to do more chronic dosing studies or not – chronic daily dosing studies or not umer raffat  evercore group llc so thats not final then david c david nicholson  allergan plc were in discussions with the agency what package we need yes umer raffat  evercore group llc okay brenton l saunders  allergan plc just to be fair on where were at all development programs are similar in that regard theres nothing c david nicholson  allergan plc oh sure were always discussing with the agency precisely what package we need if thats what you mean umer and we consistently have dialogue with them brenton l saunders  allergan plc i wouldnt read into this any different than any other development program and our interaction with regulators that is fluid and dynamic all the time thats how you minimize the potential for surprises umer raffat  evercore group llc right but the fact that you havent initiated it today is it fair to say that that basically implies as of today you dont think you need a continuous dosing study c david nicholson  allergan plc right umer raffat  evercore group llc okay brenton l saunders  allergan plc okay i think with respect to large ma its hard to speculate on the theoretical i would say that allergan is in a very strong position today with no need to do large ma with the caveat that well always be opportunistic and do whats right for our shareholders our focus is on stepping stones and continuing to advance our own strategy i think large ma generally is driven – good smart large ma is generally driven by strong strategic rationale and that usually is because you believe the asset is better in your hands a combination you can do more with you can grow the business better and gain efficiencies out of the business or because you have a big gap in your own business that you need to cover for we dont have a big gap in our business that we need to cover for so the odds of us doing large ma i think are very low umer raffat  evercore group llc thank you very much operator and our next question comes from the line of marc goodman at ubs marc goodman  ubs securities llc good morning two questions first brent can you talk about the ous business and the infrastructure that you have and how you think about building that out internally and whether you feel like you need to do maybe some small boltons to give you better infrastructure overseas obviously youve got a lot of products to push through and im just wondering if youre maximizing that opportunity right now and how you think about it and then secondly you all talked about trade buying patterns that were a bunch of onetimers were familiar with the change with linzess can you help us with some of the other products that had some significant changes in the quarter thanks brenton l saunders  allergan plc sure and ill ask bill to chime in here as well from my perspective when you look at our international business it is one of the consistent shining stars of our growth story sales up  excluding fx and we saw strong growth from every region anchored by latin americacanada and asiapacific but also turkey middle east africa put up a strong doubledigit growth western europe high single digit and even growth out of the nesee north east  south east europe region which is traditionally a more difficult area so this is a good business remember its anchored by medical aesthetics and eye care in the markets which we compete we are continuing to make select investments in field force and support for brands and promotion and rd continues to invest to get product approval and product flow in these markets were always open to bolton acquisitions in those markets to the extent they make strong strategic logic and have strong financial results but bill any other comments william j meury  allergan plc yes i dont think from a geographical footprint we need to do anything different were operating directly in  countries roughly  power over  of our business we expanded our commercial operations in asiapacific and in part in turkey middle eastafrica to support our medical aesthetics business i think as brent said medical aesthetics and eye care will be solid businesses for the next several years and with our pipeline id expect that gastroenterology and cns will become much more relevant in the future brenton l saunders  allergan plc with respect to grosstonet do you want to – trade buying patterns maria teresa hilado  allergan plc so marc we expect that – we experienced some change of inventory destocking in q of less than one week which we guided you through last quarter it was linzess but it was across many of our general medicines products plus glaucoma is where we experienced this destocking brenton l saunders  allergan plc i think operator well take one more question operator and your next question comes from the line of gregg gilbert deutsche bank gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc thanks good morning and welcome daphne david a couple for you im sorry if i missed it but can you share the next steps and timeline on the botox depression program and on the novartis nash deal can you talk to your confidence in your internal fxr was this really just a speed play and lastly for bill can you comment on restasis i assume its tracking as you had expected in the face of new competition and maybe talk about how part d dynamics in there being better covered there next year play into the equation longer term thanks brenton l saunders  allergan plc david do you want to take the first part c david nicholson  allergan plc sure regarding the novartis nash collaboration yes this essentially allows us to accelerate our understanding of the potential of the cvc fxr agonist please dont read into that deal any decrease in the confidence of our own programs the ind is open for our lead fxr and well be starting to test the agent in volunteers very soon so no decrease in confidence in our own programs to accelerate the understanding regarding botox in depression we need to go and have a discussion with the agency about the data and how they see it and we also need to finalize our thinking around what part of our toxin program we should move forward with in depression william j meury  allergan plc and as it relates to restasis i think most of the competitive pressure over the past three quarters roughly has been offset by innovation market expansion and our formulary coverage just in terms of innovation were launching four new products in eye care we of course have mdpf truetear a new artificial tear and omega  based artificial tear and then xen so were in a very good position i think brent said it well which is were back on offense as it relates to formulary coverage roughly  of restasis and other dry eye products will run through medicare part d and today we have  coverage our outofpocket cost is probably  –  a day given that coverage and the reversal and rejections are very low and we dont have a complete line of sight into  but my sense is that once we complete negotiations for part d the picture in  is going to look comparable and as good as  and so were exactly where we want to be as it relates to restasis gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc thanks brenton l saunders  allergan plc great so with that being our last question i just wanted to again thank our colleagues at allergan for very strong financial execution which will allow us to continue to invest in medical innovation and specifically our six star programs thank you all for joining us today and

looking for firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
