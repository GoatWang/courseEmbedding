totals for the different groups and dividing this sum by the number of studies in the group the indicator is expressed in terms of a percentage if the total is greater than zero then this is a buy if the total is zero then this is a hold if the total is less than zero then this is a sell to keep the results in a more logical format we factor the overall opinion by  to keep the end result in

historically the strength can be one of the following five readings maximum strong average weak minimum maximum is the strongest this signal has been in the historical period and minimum is the

than a weak buy signal a hold signal does not have any strength signal direction  buysell signal direction the signal direction is a shortterm day measurement of the current movement of the signal regardless if signal is a buy or sell the direction is an indication of whether the most recent price movement is going along with the signal the buysell direction can be one of the following five readings strongest strengthening average weakening weakest a buy signal with a strongest direction means a buy signal which is becoming stronger similarly a sell signal with a strongest direction is becoming stronger the direction goes with the signal hold signal direction the signal direction of a hold signal is a shortterm day measurement of where the signal is heading be it toward a buy signal or a sell signal the hold direction can be one of the following five readings bullish rising steady falling bearish a bullish hold signal indicates that the signal is heading toward a buy
