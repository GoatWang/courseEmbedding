the toro company’s centennial in  with fellow employees and channel partners vice president secretary and general counsel tim dordell reflected on the path that led him to what he considers “one of the best legal positions in the country” with its headquarters in bloomington minnesota the toro company is a leading worldwide provider of innovative solutions for the outdoor environment including turf snow and ground engaging equipment and irrigation and outdoor lighting solutions with sales of  billion in fiscal  toro’s global presence extends to more than  countries citing his father as a main influence dordell had early aspirations to become an attorney a managing partner at a midsize firm in st paul dordell’s father made a huge impact on his son’s view of the practice of law “my father was a lawyer’s lawyer” he said “he practiced corporate and banking law insurance defense and workers’ comp tried and appealed cases to the minnesota supreme court and the eighth circuit and did everything in between” recalled dordell “i always admired his love of the law the intellectual challenge he found in it the tenacity when representing clients as well as his civility toward colleagues and opposing counsel and i’ve tried to follow his example” dordell’s father passed away in  a twin cities native dordell always appreciated the people and civic and business communities in minnesota but he realized that as soon as he graduated from law school he had some wanderlust and wanted to get out and explore another part of the country too following law school dordell moved to phoenix to practice corporate securities law with a large law firm several years later he accepted his first inhouse position with a local direct marketing and cable television production company which ended up in bankruptcy “i learned a lot” he said “about the kind of company i wanted to be a part of in the future” an opportunity then arose to move back to minnesota to join a large local firm which he accepted and relocated back to his home state several years later dordell transitioned back into an inhouse counsel position at ecolab inc where he rose through the ranks from a senior attorney to the associate general counsel and assistant secretary over the course of nearly a decade “it’s less typical to enter into an inhouse corporate law position right out of school but many attorneys migrate into the corporate setting after receiving excellent training in private practice” said dordell “i encourage new lawyers to follow their interests and passions to find the best fit and use of their law degree ultimately an inhouse role is the right fit for me as general counsel i have a variety of responsibilities but for an inhouse legal team it’s ultimately about being a critical partner to help drive companywide business objectives” today dordell leads toro’s legal department which is comprised of  employees with nine attorneys and the balance consisting of paralegals regulatory professionals and support staff due to his background as a corporate securities attorney he has experience in merger and acquisition transactions fiduciary oversight of the employees’ k plan and new york stock exchange and us securities and exchange commission compliance requirements dordell is also part of the ceo’s senior staff “i have great respect for a solo practitioner or single inhouse general counsel because their job is so broad” noted dordell perhaps thinking about the breadth of his father’s practice “but here at the toro company i am grateful for our legal team where each member not only has subject matter expertise but also is connected to business divisions or corporate functions where their roles allow them to offer sound legal advice and counsel to their toro colleagues i’m proud of the skill and experience they bring to the job “by helping achieve business objectives” dordell continued “we’re valued members of the toro team – and valued by our toro teammates” typically a requirement to join an inhouse legal department would be a juris doctor degree or paralegal certificate but dordell notes that the toro legal team has expanded its scope to encompass global product and packaging regulatory compliance – and individuals with plant operational and other experiences have joined the team as another example heather hille whose focus is real estate law helped lead the recent facility expansion project to grow the company’s product development and testing capacities and secure additional space at toro’s headquarter campus in addition former associate general counsel amy dahl now focuses on investor relations and leads the corporate communications team dordell is proud of the team’s expanded responsibilities and accomplishments and how others are leveraging their legal background to pursue growth opportunities outside of the department meanwhile his team stays focused and true to their core mission to help achieve business objectives keep the toro company compliant with the constantly changing global regulations adhere to an ethical code of conduct protect intellectual property rights support strong corporate governance and resolve disputes product integrity is a hot topic for the company dordell’s team focuses on a threestep process to help the company design safe products and ultimately mitigate product liability claims that arise first of all there is good communication between his team and the engineering and customer care teams to stress proper and safe design and use of the company’s products secondly should an accident occur the team will intervene quickly and conduct an accident investigation “the key” he says “is to treat the individual as an unhappy customer not a litigation adversary” finally the team strives for a resolution through negotiation or mediation he stresses that most people realize that they were using products for inappropriate tasks or otherwise in a way contrary to the intended use and instructions while dordell and his team comprise a fairly large legal department they recognize the need to focus on specific highvalue business priorities while seeking outside counsel for lower priority tasks or items that may not fall under the inhouse expertise umbrella “for example” he says “we don’t have inhouse attorneys that stand up in the courtroom to argue motions to judges or make closing arguments to juries” stressing the necessity to choose the right partner for the right project the team uses a “convergence model” to describe how they partner with outside counsel the team begins by collaborating with key outside counsel partners to create synergies and strengthen longterm relationships built on trust respect integrity and teamwork through clear communication they ensure that partners understand the toro company’s objectives and that the team understands where their partners’ strengths and weaknesses lay in regard to achieving the goals together they develop strategies and set expectations based on these steps the correct fit for each project with an outside counsel partner is determined “pick the right partner for the right project” is dordell’s mantra in addition to his duties as general counsel dordell also serves on the board of the toro foundation whose mission is to help enrich the lives the land the communities and the industries toro serves outside the office dordell currently serves on the board of a local musical theater group called theater latté da and previously he served as a member of the board of directors for the minnesota aids project “i received a wise perspective on the job from my former boss at ecolab” recalled dordell “after accepting the offer to join the toro company he said a general counsel position is as good as it gets when you are part of a growing and profitable company with a good culture there’s a collegial and engaged board that provides sound oversight the ceo drives performance and sets the tone at the top while giving the general counsel a seat at the table and most importantly you are surrounded by a team of strong and valued legal professionals that work together to help the company succeed” if those are pillars of a successful position dordell admits that he is one lucky guy   for more information visit wwwthetorocompanycom share the post attorney of the month tim
