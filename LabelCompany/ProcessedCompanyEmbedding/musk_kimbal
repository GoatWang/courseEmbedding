his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin

orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex

dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand

the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united

to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you

artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview

elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he lost consciousness musk was initially educated at private schools attending the englishspeaking waterkloof house preparatory school musk later graduated from pretoria boys high school and moved to canada in june  just before his th birthday after obtaining canadian citizenship through his canadianborn mother education at the age of  musk was accepted into queens university in kingston ontario for undergraduate study in  after spending two years at queens university musk transferred to the university of pennsylvania where in may  he received a bachelor of science degree in physics from its college of arts and sciences and a bachelor of science degree in economics from its wharton school of business musk extended his studies for one year to finish the second bachelors degree while at the university of pennsylvania musk and fellow penn student adeo ressi rented a bedroom fraternity house using it as an unofficial nightclub in  at age  musk moved to california to begin a phd in applied physics and materials science at stanford university but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the internet renewable energy and outer space in  he became a us citizen career zip main article zip in  musk and his brother kimbal started zip a web software company with us of their fathers money the company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry musk obtained contracts with the new york times and the chicago tribune and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with citysearch while at zip musk wanted to become ceo however none of the board members would allow it compaq acquired zip for us million in cash and us million in stock options in february  musk received us million for his  share from the sale xcom and paypal main article paypal in march  musk cofounded xcom an online financial services and email payment company with us million from the sale of zip one year later the company merged with confinity which had a money transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board due to disagreements with other company leadership notably over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon  aircraft used in the  film thank you for smoking is registered to musk nsx and musk had a cameo as the pilot of his plane opening the door for robert duvall and escorting aaron eckhart aboard musk owns wet nellie the lotus esprit from the james bond film the spy who loved me he plans to convert it into the functional carsubmarine from the film musk attended the burning man festival in  and has said he first thought up the idea for solarcity at the festival tosca musk elons sister is a filmmaker she is the founder of musk entertainment and has produced various movies musk stated that he wants to die on mars just not on impact philanthropy musk is chairman of the musk foundation which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity as of  musk is a trustee of the x prize foundation and a signatory of the giving pledge family musk met

over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon  aircraft used in the  film thank you for smoking is registered to musk nsx and musk had a cameo as the pilot of

functional carsubmarine from the film musk attended the burning man festival in  and has said he first thought up the idea for solarcity at the festival tosca musk elons sister is a filmmaker she is the founder of musk entertainment and has produced various movies musk stated that he wants to die on mars just not on impact philanthropy musk is chairman of the musk foundation which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity as of  musk is a trustee of the x prize foundation and a signatory of the giving pledge family musk met his first wife canadian author justine wilson while both were students at ontarios queens university they married in  and separated in  their first son nevada alexander musk died of sudden infant death syndrome sids at the age of ten weeks they later had five sons through in vitro fertilization – twins in  followed by triplets in  – all of whom they share custody in  musk began dating english

food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on

mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to

transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board due to disagreements with other company leadership notably over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who

food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years

electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to

stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also

july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to

digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon  aircraft used in the  film thank you for smoking is registered to musk nsx and musk had a cameo as the pilot of

question i often ask myself i have always loved food and for me even if i was on a beach i would be cooking food every day the other thing restaurants do for me which i love is being around people the sense of community bh would you have started a restaurant if you hadn’t lived through  km i don’t know it’s impossible to imagine my life without that experience i do think that there is something genetic about it – with me – that i have to do something that i am passionate about restaurants keep my mind busy and active when i opened the kitchen in a way it was more stressful than any of my other businesses i was very afraid of failure because if you fail at something you love then you ruin what you love it worked out very well but if you truly put your life’s work behind your passion you risk sacrificing your passion bh how did you choose boulder km we kimbal and his then wife jen lewin did a road trip i am a big weather guy so in february  we went to chicago jackson hole denver boulder santa fe san diego laguna beach la san francisco portland seattle all great cities but in february the area that does really well is denver and boulder even when it’s snowing it’s beautiful everywhere else it wasn’t so great bh so going to boulder was weather driven more than economy driven km the food scene in boulder drew me in denver at that time wasn’t quite ready for what i wanted to do now it’s thriving but in  it was still trying to figure itself out bh how do the challenges your brother faces compare to your challenges opening a restaurant and challenging the food culture how are the frontiers similar km my brother is about energy spacex is his passion and i love being a part of that company energy is where he spends a lot of his time and thinking in terms of having an impact on the world food and energy are kind of in the same category for me creating a supply chain of what we should be eating is incredibly complicated it’s complicated to figure out how to change the food system in america bh you were one of the first restaurants i saw that sourced all your food and posted it on the wall of the restaurant km we take enormous care to understand where our food comes from and how it was grown i saw a billboard for a food company on my way down here to denver today it said “fresh cracked eggs every day” and i just said to myself “i don’t believe it” and that’s the problem these companies face they have a long reputation of sacrificing everything for price and that pushes the calories up pushed the nutrients down it includes an incredible amount of artificial ingredients those companies have to figure out a how to change it and it’s not easy to change bh i don’t believe what restaurants tell me especially in the mountains they tell me they are serving olathe corn in june and there is no such thing as olathe corn in june km we see that all the time large or small companies can make any claim they want bh there is no menu police km we need more transparency especially when it comes to local farm supply these farmers are working very hard if they have a product that you use great but if their product is just claimed to be used it can be extremely damaging to the industry to the farm to the trust of the restaurants bh your mission has grown since you started the kitchen km we started with a nonprofit school program teaching kids about food but after working a couple of years working with the restaurants and the school gardens i just didn’t see much scale we were doing two gardensayear in boulder and we had two successful restaurants but i just couldn’t figure out how to scale it so i went back to the tech world for about four years and i was really unhappy tech is fun but it is disconnected from the community then i had an accident in  kimbal crashed while tubing in a ski mountain and was paralyzed for three days with a broken neck an operation and recuperation left him prone and alone for two months i started thinking about how i was going to scale the restaurants and the school gardens and because i broke my neck i had this incredible opportunity to restart everything we opened the first learning garden in  and we opened the first kitchen next door which was more affordable more fun a faster experience bh is the idea of scale some genetic thing like “hey i’m going to mars” km i don’t know when i was younger i didn’t understand how important scale was and now that i have done a few businesses if there isn’t scale it doesn’t get my juices going bh how big a part does taste and flavor play in your restaurants km in the end the food has to taste good if the product isn’t good – it doesn’t matter if it’s food or cars or smart phones – no one is going to want the product no matter how good your mission is bh your plate seems pretty full you’re doing a lot km yes it’s a lot but i really enjoy it i learn something from all these companies chipotle it’s obvious their growth depends on the supply chain so it’s very interesting to have a frontrow seat to that and spacex how could that not be interesting it’s an incredible endeavor and it’s my brother’s passion so i love being a part of that tesla i was part of that from the beginning elon and i wanted it to exist we wanted electric cars to exist and i learn so much about tangible products not software there is so much there that i can bring back to my business bh you drive a tesla km i love it once somebody drives a tesla it’s hard to imagine going back to another car bh what your idea of happiness km i am a pretty happy guy inner peace just being able to understand what’s going on inside my head without getting caught up in it bh in a story i read your mother described you as “kind and considerate” km she’s not biased at all bh do you miss south africa km not really i love america it’s the best country in the world and i’ve checked bh what’s your greatest fear km doing things by myself i don’t like that at all i always bring people together with whatever i do maybe it’s the selfish reason to be kind and considerate to keep people wanting to hang out with me bh what’s your greatest extravagance km i took my tesla and redesigned it from the inside out but i am not super materialistic i have a nice house in boulder but nothing fancy i have one car one bike bh when and where were you happiest km i have been happy many times in my life i was very happy when i was first married and bizarrely i was very happy after i broke my neck my body was in shock and i have never been happier bh maybe it was the pain pills km i hated the drugs and i stopped taking them but i was extraordinarily happy happiness isn’t my problem i have always had a sense of happiness bh what do you think of gmos km they have an enormous role to play in the future but they have been done terribly by the people doing them there is no trust in gmos so they are being rejected by society bh reading km this is embarrassing but i just started reading michael pollan bh what about mark bittman km i read his stuff in the new york times he’s fantastic i see pollan and bittman go straight to the real problems without any agenda bh is there a food you would not eat km no i’ll even eat a big mac if i feel like it i probably wouldn’t eat the whole thing bh you don’t claim that the the kitchen is a health restaurant km we have never considered ourselves to be a health restaurant we are a “real food” restaurant you can get a real connection to the community through our food but if you order a side of fries they may be the best fries you have ever had but they are still fries you can’t get around the fact that they are potatoes fried in oil bh would you like to be famous km i have watched my brother become quite famous and it’s definitely a twoedged sword it’s by no means a blessing i mean going out to dinner with my brother is really tough the better known he gets the harder it gets bh is it a burden being elon musk’s brother km there are many ways to look at it – but it’s as amazing as you could imagine bh what are you most grateful for km my kids and the experiences i have had having a brother like elon   bh when was the last time you cried in front of somebody km i saw “inside out” with my kids and it was an incredibly emotional movie there i was sobbing bh do you have a motto km it’s more of a story than a motto an yearold man is talking to a yearold man and the yearold is really frustrated the old man says “when i was in my s i really cared about what people thought about me and when i was in my s i decided i didn’t care what people thought about me and now that i’m in my s i realize that they were never thinking about me at all” bill husted former denver post and rocky mountain news

newsemerging chains kimbal musk to expand next door concept “real food” brand to add  units across american heartland lisa jennings  feb   kimbal musk cofounder of the kitchen restaurants plans to grow his casual “real food” restaurant concept next door american eatery across the us heartland musk a technology entrepreneur is known for his fullservice concept the kitchen bistros with locations in colorado tennessee and chicago founded with chef hugo matheson and jen lewin in  in  the group launched a more casual variation of the kitchen called next door now with three locations which musk plans to expand with the goal of reaching  units by  next door has a menu of soups salads burgers and daily specials and a full bar with beer and wine on tap with a price range of about  per head  the concept has also found a balance between dine in and togo business including delivery using techbased thirdparty services like ubereats doordash and postmates said musk “we think we’ve created a new category called urban casual which is a blend between dine in and digital to go” he said  traditional fastcasual restaurants at about square feet and casual dining restaurants typically sized between  and square feet “are not doing well right now” he said “we have found a real niche with squarefoot restaurants with goodsized kitchens and about  seats” he said “close to  percent of our business is to go” though mostly pick up and the togo business is growing he added  “we saw percent growth in togo last year” he said “we designed our entire menu to focus on offering a great instore dining experience and being an amazing gathering place for millennials and enabling folks to recreate the dining experience in their home with really quality togo products” musk is focusing on america’s heartland states to grow next door in part because it’s good for business “the people are warm and welcoming” he said “the economics are fantastic the landlords are great to work with it’s a restaurant owner’s market” concepts like this are plentiful in cities like new york and los angeles said musk but in mid america there’s a real unmet need for restaurants offering this kind of “real food” he said by “real food” musk said he means madefromscratch menus offering “food you trust to nourish your body nourish the farmer and nourish the planet”  a member of chipotle mexican grill’s board of directors musk has long been a proponent of sourcing sustainable ingredients he’s also on the board at tesla motors and spacex companies founded by his brother elon musk consumers are demanding more transparency about the food they eat and scaling a restaurant concept with direct ties to its suppliers remains a challenge he said  “it’s about knowing the farmer or the beef supplier and how that cattle was raised” he said “in the industrial food system there is no trust” the kitchen restaurants however has build a supply chain that allows for the kind of growth musk has in mind it’s not just about having local ingredients he noted “we’re in colorado and we have to find fish from fishmongers in seattle or maine” said musk “but it takes years to build the kind of relationship where we can truly trust the product and to build that relationship with customers so they trust us to make decisions for them” the group looks at suppliers in terms of tiers he said tier  suppliers are physically local with carrots or baked goods coming from the community tier  includes suppliers that may be some distance away but with whom the group has a close relationship like la quercia cured meats in iowa for example tier  includes ingredients “off the back of a truck like any restaurant might use” he said  next door is aiming to get percent of ingredients from tier  and  suppliers and  percent at the kitchen said musk  that focus on ingredients is a key differentiator for the group most restaurants aren’t willing to take this kind of control over their supply chain simply because it’s hard work juggling so many suppliers he said  the kitchen restaurants for example also uses produce like arugula from vertical farmers using new technologies like growing fruits and vegetables in shipping containers musk is also cofounder of the verticle farming startup square roots that creates the equivalent of two growing acres inside a climatecontrolled squarefoot module six locations of next door are scheduled to open over the next six months he said including no  in memphis which will open in may musk is conducting an equity fundraise to support the planned growth he declined to offer specifics on sales at existing units but said the group has seen “phenomenal growth” across three locations in denver the concept serves about  guests a week he said musk said the group employs more than  people and has sourced millions of dollars worth of food from american farmers helping to strengthen local food economies “but we’re only getting started” he said “we won’t stop until real food becomes the new normal”  contact lisa jennings at email protected follow her on twitter livetodineout tags food trends technology  comments hide comments comment  more information

et   shares elon musks legacy is closely tied to the fate of his electric car company but so is that of his brother elons brother kimbal is also a tesla board member and he had a lot to lose during the great recession this was in  kimbal recalls i mean everyone thought the world was collapsing dealing with product delays recalls and a shortage of funds tesla looked like it could have followed general motors and many other niche automakers over the years into bankruptcy mary stevens  cnbc kimbal musk meets with square root farmers at the companys brooklyn headquarters home to farms housed in shipping containers i had to decide whether to invest in tesla and basically divest of all my other assets to do that going to the point of bankruptcy and so forth he says ultimately he took the risk it was such a missiondriven company i couldnt really have forgiven myself if i didnt make the investment considering how well tesla has fared since its clear why musk labels that decision the best investment hes ever made but the uncertainty was worth more to him than just the dollar return it taught him a lesson that he has applied to his latest ventures his boulder colorado restaurant the kitchen and next door a series of affordable farmtotable restaurants whose mission is to improve nutrition and community farming across the country it taught him the value of outside investors mary stevens  cnbc kimbal musk gives investors a tour of square roots a brooklyn urban farming startup he cofounded i think its another thing ive learned since  — we were selffunding so much of our businesses back then and ill never do that again musk says he points out that investors bring much more to the table than just funding having a broad network of investors is something that ive decided to do you know for all my businesses because you want a good syndicate of folks around you when things are tough he says i think even if you could do all your own funding you should go through the hard work of getting investors because the other thing investors do is that they give you true market feedback on whether what youre doing is correct for musks mission to help improve access to fresh food across america that has meant making sure he can see results from the nonprofit communityoriented part of the kitchen the kitchen community  the kitchens nonprofit arm learning gardens provides schools with gardens to help students learn about the importance of fresh foods after observing that students become  percent more likely to eat vegetables served in the nearly  schools where musks learning gardens allowed students to grow their own produce musk was satisfied and the project attracted interest from other underserved communities and donors most of our funding comes from local communities says musk if what were doing isnt actually impactful then that funding will dry up and so its good to have outside funding because it gives you accountability that what youre doing is actually really important and effective ﻿—video by mary stevens zack guzmanassociate producerwriter to view this site you need to have javascript enabled in your browser and either the flash plugin or

share on whatsapp share on messenger close andy meek sunday  june   edt it can be tricky for anyone being the younger sibling but imagine what it must be like to be the younger brother of elon musk a businessman habitually referred to as a real life tony stark his reputation seems to get more outsized with each fresh headline just this week the elder musk’s company spacex filed paperwork asking for permission to use satellites to beam down internet service from space meanwhile his other highprofile company tesla continues to make advances toward its ambition to make electric cars more ubiquitous then there is the fascination with colonizing mars kimbal musk  is a year younger than elon and a very successful businessman and entrepreneur in his own right but he admits the pair who grew up in pretoria south africa before moving to canada to study and then the us have a slightly different take on the world of business “we have similar views …though his are stratospheric while mine are more in the ground” food is a dominant theme in kimbal musk’s personal and business interests he is a healthconscious chef restaurant owner with his own sense of mission about subjects close to his heart linking people’s food to their communities and tackling childhood obesity in an interview with the guardian he speaks about his hopes for his food projects  and the inspiration he gets from his brother the younger musk in addition to his work as a philanthropist investor and entrepreneur is a board member at tesla spacex the anschutz health and wellness center and chipotle mexican grill “i’ve always loved food” said kimbal musk a cofounder of the kitchen family of restaurants in colorado and elsewhere which make a point of sourcing from local farmers “growing up i cooked in the house and when i cooked everyone would sit down and eat and it was just kind of the way i connected with my family i used to throw cooking parties in university everyone would come over – sometimes you’d just do a mac and cheese but if you do that better than everyone else you can get people to come to you” kimbal musk is gregarious and charming his brother is intense and technical kimbal made millions working at a startup with elon and invested in his brother’s biggest dreams along the way  and he is no less dogged about chasing a few of his own the differences between the things that give the brothers purpose are striking – one musk works to change the world through hightech inventions the other is most passionate about food about teaching people to grow things and preparing meals that help people find a sense of community still the younger musk turns to a sports metaphor to explain how different as they are he’s still learned plenty from his brother whose business interests at times read like the pursuit of turning science fiction into reality “when you think about basketball and you watch someone like michael jordan play basketball – even if you’re a baseball player there’s still a lot to learn from there” musk said “i really think about him more as my brother to be quite honest it’s kind of a tough question to answer because he’s been so core to my life that it’s hard to describe specific things” elon clearly trusts his instincts though in light of the fact that should he ever become incapacitated in some way kimbal is the spacex and tesla trustee who’d lead the task of figuring out what should happen with both companies meanwhile kimbal has plenty of his own interests to keep him busy he cofounded the kitchen family of restaurants in boulder in  along with jen lewin and hugo matheson it has eight restaurant locations today in colorado as well as an outoftown location in chicago in addition to plans to expand in chicago and colorado three new locations are on the drawing board for memphis over the next couple of years the kitchen actually refers to three related restaurant concepts there’s the kitchen the organization’s flagship community bistro and the kitchen upstairs a cocktail lounge with food prepared in a wood oven and artisan cocktails rounding out the list is the kitchen next door a community pub that serves things like burgers salads sandwiches margaritas and beer for its coloradoarea restaurants the kitchen claims to source  million worth of product from local providers in the greater denver area the kitchen serves  guests per week on average in  musk cofounded the kitchen community a nonprofit that works to bring outdoor gardens – “learning gardens” as they’re called – to schools around the country three years after its founding the nonprofit had already built  such gardens in chicago los angeles and colorado schools reaching more than  children it’s a different world entirely from the more fastpaced tech scene in which he once worked with elon their early partnership followed the younger musk’s graduation from high school in pretoria and decamping to toronto to reconnect with his brother kimbal graduated from queen’s college in  the same year the brothers started the webbased city guide platform zip a venture which compaq bought in  for m from there the younger musk began investing in tech companies including elon’s xcom a payments venture eventually renamed as paypal that ebay would snatch up for bn the brothers’ worlds diverged when elon decided after some of his early successes to stay in the golden state while kimbal moved to new york city and enrolled at the french culinary institute he was there in  during the terrorist attacks of september  and spent six weeks cooking for firefighters at ground zero a formative moment for him “my intent had been to go back to tech at some point” musk said “cooking for the firefighters it was this just overwhelming sense of community that was created it’s impossible to describe how intense and awesome it was to see everyone doing that it was simultaneously the best and worst thing that had ever happened to me – to see  and be part of helping bring people together “doing that every day for  hours a day six days a week my brain couldn’t go back to tech i determined right there and then to open a restaurant” he decided that it wouldn’t be in new york turned off somewhat by the “intensity” of the city he instead traveled the country with his wife at the time and settled on boulder colorado after musk cofounded the kitchen the organization hummed along steadily for a few years then came a ski accident in  that musk calls a “near death experience” one that left him hospitalized for months and helped crystallize his thinking about what would come next for him a restaurant he’d decided could indeed be a positive force in its small corner of the world – in things like the customers it touches in the quality of ingredients it uses and in the care of preparation but it couldn’t really “scale” – the ambition that drives so many entrepreneurs like the musks who crave big challenges big wins after the accident musk said “i sort of got a new lease on life i said i now have every excuse in the world to do what i want and you know what i’m going to work on food culture and help food become fun and part of peoples’ lives again the traditional restaurant is more commercialoriented but i want community through food” that gave birth to his gardenfocused nonprofit which when it comes to a new community looks to plant  gardens at a time the gardens are a combination play space and outdoor classroom that connect children to the process of growing food and give teachers an outlet for handson instruction and the kitchen community raises  for each garden a cost that includes everything from landscape design to site prep while the finished garden can include things like internal irrigation bench seating and curvilinear plant beds a mix of foundations and individual donors funds the kitchen community’s efforts across the states where it’s placed gardens today the kitchen community has more than  learning gardens in schools across colorado chicago los angeles and memphis tackling childhood obesity is a big motivation behind the gardens in schools “when i look at the problem of obesity it’s a depressing problem so how do you create a solution that delights people we came up with this design  my exwife who i’m still friends with she knows how to create something where you go ‘i’m so glad this is here i really want to have this in my school i want to learn here’ the gardens this is a product that really delights people” in deciding where to take his garden concept next geographically musk says the organization looks for cities that have foundations that can support a concept like this one his team also looks at schools with districts amenable to the concept not surprisingly the level of support from one city to the next varies if you’re in a town like boulder he points out there’s not much foundation support from a problem like childhood obesity because it’s not a place where the problem of obesity is especially acute meanwhile gardens where children grow food while also learning about science supporting local farmers and vendors building operations that transform communities through food – these are the among the things that occupy musk’s mind the things he wants to spend his money and time on innovation and purpose to entrepreneurs like him don’t always have to involve gadgets and leaps in science – sometimes it starts with a thing as mundane as the food we eat “for me i like to think in terms of three months out and  years out” musk said “three months out is what to do now  years out is what i’d like to do before i’m dead “if i look back and see specific communities where i made a difference using food i will pass very peacefully”

interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon

musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity

march  musk cofounded xcom an online financial services and email payment company with us million from the sale of zip one year later the company merged with confinity which had a money transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were

over his desire to move paypals unixbased infrastructure to microsoft windows in october  paypal was acquired by ebay for us billion in stock of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two rectangles and a dot thats where we were now  years later we have photorealistic d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and its getting better every year and soon well have virtual reality well have augmented reality if you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality just indistinguishable personal life musk owned a mclaren f supercar which he crashed while it was uninsured he also previously owned an aero l a czechmade jet trainer aircraft  the  model dassault falcon  aircraft used in the  film thank you for smoking is registered to musk nsx and musk had a cameo as the pilot of

philanthropic efforts on providing solarpower energy systems in disaster areas in  the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a kw solar power system to the south bay community alliances sbca hurricane response center in coden alabama in july  the musk foundation donated us towards a solar power project in sōma japan a city that had been recently devastated by tsunami in july  musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo the grandnephew of nikola tesla to donate us million toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe ultimately musk agreed to donate us million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park musk donated us million to the future of life institute in january  to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity as of  musk is a trustee of the x prize foundation and a signatory of the giving pledge family musk met

later the company merged with confinity which had a money transfer service called paypal the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in  paypals early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service musk was ousted in october  from his role as ceo although he remained on the board

of which musk received us million before its sale musk who was the companys largest shareholder owned  of paypals shares spacex main article spacex in  musk conceptualized mars oasis a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars containing food crops growing on martian regolith in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration in october  musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell an aerospace supplies fixer and adeo ressi his best friend from college to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms that could send the envisioned payloads into space the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras however according to cantrell musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers and the group returned to the united states emptyhanded in february  the group returned to russia to look for three icbms bringing along mike griffin who had worked for the cias venture capital arm inqtel nasas jet propulsion laboratory and was just leaving orbital sciences a maker of satellites and spacecraft the group met again with kosmotras and were offered one rocket for us million however this was seen by musk as too expensive musk consequently stormed out of the meeting on the flight back from moscow musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only  percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time it was concluded that theoretically by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a percent gross margin ultimately musk ended up founding spacex with the longterm goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization musk and president barack obama at the falcon  launch site in  with us million of his early fortune musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex in may  musk is chief executive officer ceo and chief technology officer cto of the hawthorne californiabased company spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology the companys first two launch vehicles are the falcon  and falcon  rockets a nod to star wars millennium falcon and its first spacecraft is the dragon a nod to puff the magic dragon in seven years spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft in september  spacexs falcon  rocket became the first privately funded liquidfueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit on may   the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station in  spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon  launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space stationnot in citation given followed by a us billion nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december   for  flights of its falcon  rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in  astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by  on  december  spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space this first stage recovery was replicated several times in  by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship an ocean based recovery platform spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for highest thrusttoweight ratio for a rocket engine spacex has produced more than  operational merlin d engines currently the worlds most powerful engine for its weight the relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each merlin d engine to vertically lift the weight of  average family cars in combination the  merlin engines in the falcon  first stage produces anywhere from  to  mn  to  million pounds of thrust depending on altitude musk was influenced by isaac asimovs foundation series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw an engineered virus inadvertent creation of a micro black hole catastrophic global warming or some asyetunknown technology could spell the end of us humankind evolved over millions of years but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves sooner or later we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct musks goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of  in a  interview he said he hopes to send humans to mars surface within – years in ashlee vances biography musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by  with a population of  musk stated that since mars atmosphere lacks oxygen all transportation would have to be electric electric cars electric trains hyperloop electric aircraft space x intends to launch a dragon spacecraft on a falcon heavy in  to softland on mars  this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supplyrun to mars building up to later crewed flights musk stated in june  that the first unmanned flight of the larger mars colonial transporter mct spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in  to be followed by the first manned mct mars flight departing in  in september  musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize mars by  musks private trust holds  of spacex stock equivalent to  of voting shares tesla main article tesla inc tesla inc originally tesla motors was incorporated in july  by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning who financed the company until the series a round of funding both men played active roles in the companys early development prior to elon musks involvement musk led the series a round of investment in february  joining teslas board of directors as its chairman musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level but was not deeply involved in daytoday business operations following the financial crisis in  musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect positions he still holds today tesla motors first built an electric sports car the tesla roadster in  with sales of about  vehicles to  countries tesla began delivery of its fourdoor model s sedan on june   it unveiled its third product the model x aimed at the suvminivan market on february   the model x launch was however delayed until september  in addition to its own cars tesla sells electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev mercedes bclass electric drive and mercedes a class and to toyota for the rav ev musk was able to bring in both companies as longterm investors in tesla musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the nummi plant now known as the tesla factory fremont california in  musk standing in front of a tesla model s in  musk and senator dianne feinstein next to a tesla model s  musk has favored building a subus compact tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products inhouse this led to the model  that is planned to have a base price of us several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains in a may  interview with all things digital musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars tesla is dramatically accelerating its network of supercharger stations tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the us that june with plans for more expansion across north america including canada throughout the year as of january   musk owns about  million tesla shares which equates to about  of the company as of  musks annual salary is one dollar similar to steve jobs and other ceos the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performancebased bonuses in  musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars the unfortunate reality is electric car programs or programs for any vehicle that doesnt burn hydrocarbons at the major manufacturers are small to nonexistent constituting an average of far less than  of their total vehicle sales musk said in february  musk announced that he had acquired the teslacom domain name from stu grossman who had owned it since  and changed teslas homepage to that domain solarcity main article solarcity musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity which was then cofounded in  by his cousins lyndon and peter rive solarcity is now the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla is to help combat global warming in  musk announced that solarcity and tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid with the program going live in  on june   musk committed to building in buffalo new york a solarcity advanced production facility that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states musk stated the plant will be one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent yearsneeds update in june  musks car company tesla formally submitted an offer to acquire solarcity hyperloop main articles hyperloop and hyperloop pod competition on august   musk unveiled a concept for a highspeed transportation system incorporating reducedpressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alphadesign document that in addition to scoping out the technology outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area after earlier envisioning hyperloop musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs musks proposal if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag which it is theorized would allow for highspeed travel with relatively low power with certain other features like airbearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag the alpha design document estimated the total cost of an latosf hyperloop system at us billion but this amount is speculative in june  musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacexsponsored milelong track in a – hyperloop pod competition the track was used in january  and musk also started building a tunnel hyperloop one a company unaffiliated with musk had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july   it was on may   at  am and had lasted  seconds reaching a top speed of  mph on july   elon musk announced that he had gotten approval from the department of transportation to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington dc stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore openai main article openai in december  elon musk announced the creation of openai a notforprofit artificial intelligence ai research company openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity by making ai available to everyone openai wants to counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning superintelligence systems devoted to profits as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry neuralink main article neuralink in  musk cofounded neuralink a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence the company which is still in the earliest stages of existence is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence these enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices the boring company main article the boring company on december   while stuck in traffic musk tweeted am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging the company was named the boring company on january   musk tweeted exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus and will probably go to a nearby parking garage as of january   discussions with regulatory bodies have begun but no requests for permits to dig in the los angeles area have yet been filed with the california department of transportation in february  the company began digging a footwide footlong and footdeep test trench on the premises of space xs offices in los angeles since the construction requires no permits subsidies musk has stated that he does not believe the us government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage bad behavior musk argues that the free market would achieve the best solution and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences musks statements have been widely criticized with stanford university professor fred turner noting that if youre an entrepreneur like elon musk you will take the money where you can get it but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that its entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change not the state it is not quite selfdelusion but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a freestanding independent agent and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received and this goes on all the time in silicon valley author michael shellenberger argued that in the case of musk it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness and i think there is a business reason for it they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a longterm viable business and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent shellenberger continues we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful a bit more humble while journalist and author jim motavalli who interviewed musk for high voltage his  book about the electric vehicle industry speculated that elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner and he doesnt want to see other people win because they get government money – i do think there is a tendency of people once they have succeeded to want to pull the ladder up after them in  musks statements were subject to further scrutiny when an la times article claimed that spacex tesla solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated us billion in government subsidies over twenty years one example given is new york state which is spending  million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for  a year the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade an estimated  million valuation musk employs a former us state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla political positions musk speaking alongside irish taoiseach prime minister enda kenny politically musk has described himself as half democrat half republican in his own words im somewhere in the middle socially liberal and fiscally conservative in  musk became a member of two of then presidentelect donald trumps presidential advisory committees the strategic and policy forum and manufacturing jobs initiative but resigned from both in  in protest at trumps decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change musk has described himself as nauseatingly proamerican according to musk the united states is inarguably the greatest country that has ever existed on earth describing it as the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been musk believes outright that there would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states arguing there were three separate occasions in the thcentury where democracy would have fallen with world war i world war ii and the cold war if not for the united states musk also stated that he thinks it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect it certainly is not there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done prompted by the emergence of selfdriving cars and artificial intelligence musk has voiced support for a universal basic income prior to the election of donald trump as president of the united states musk criticized candidate trump by saying i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesnt seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states following donald trumps inauguration musk expressed approval of trumps choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump regarding his cooperation with trump musk has subsequently commented the more voices of reason that the president hears the better lobbying in an interview with the washington post musk stated he was a significant though not toptier donor to democrats but that he also gives heavily to republicans musk further stated in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution a recent report from the sunlight foundation a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending found that spacex has spent over us million on lobbying congress since it was established in  and doled out more than us in political contributions to democrats and republicans the same report noted that spacexs campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated and that unlike most techstartups spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day  the report further noted that musk himself has donated roughly us to various campaigns since  in  he contributed us to president george w bushs reelection campaign maxing out over us to obamas reelection campaign and donated us to republican sen marco rubio who represents florida a state critical to the space industry  all told musk and spacex gave out roughly us in the  election cycle additionally spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company via the washingtonbased lobbying group patton boggs llp alongside patton boggs llp spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms who work alongside spacexs own lobbyists musk had been a supporter of the us political action committee pac fwdus which was started by fellow highprofile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform however in may  musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline musk and other members including david o sacks pulled out criticizing the strategy as cynical musk further stated we shouldnt give in to the politics if we give in to that well get the political system we deserve in december  sean becker of the mediapolitical website mic called musk a complete hypocrite stating that for the  election cycle musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee — both of which have funded the campaigns of antiscience antienvironment candidates such as rep michelle bachman rminn musk has directly contributed to republican sen marco rubio who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change opinions destiny and religion when asked whether he believed there was some kind of destiny involved in humanitys transition to a multiplanetary species rather than just physics musk responded well i do do i think that theres some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff i think probably not because then you have to say where does the master intelligence come from so it sort of begs the question so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics you know its complex phenomenon from simple elements musk has stated that he does not pray or worship any being although previously admitted to praying before an important falcon  launch asking any entities that were listening to bless the launch when asked whether he believed religion and science could coexist musk replied probably not extraterrestrial life although musk believes there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets he questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe musk later clarified his hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe and stated that it is probably more likely than not but thats a complete guess musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation like when youre playing an adventure game and you can see the stars in the background but you cant ever get there if its not a simulation then maybe were in a lab and theres some advanced alien civilization thats just watching how we develop out of curiosity like mould in a petri dish if you look at our current technology level something strange has to happen to civilizations and i mean strange in a bad way  and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead oneplanet civilizations artificial intelligence musk has frequently spoken out about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence declaring it the most serious threat to the survival of the human race during an interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium musk described ai as humanitys biggest existential threat further stating im increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level just to make sure that we dont do something very foolish musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as summoning the demon despite this musk has previously invested in deepmind an ai firm and vicarious a company working to improve machine intelligence in january  he donated  million to the future of life institute an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies he is the cochairman of openai a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company musk has said that his investments are not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return i like to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence musk continued there have been movies about this you know like terminator – there are some scary outcomes and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good not bad in june  he was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation to which he answered probably elaborated as follows the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following  years ago we had pong – two

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
