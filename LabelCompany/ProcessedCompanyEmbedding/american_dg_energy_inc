epa “instead of upgrading a twenty year old absorption chiller in a fortyone year old building we decided to let american dg energy install a new natural gas fired chiller that we wouldnt have to buy or maintain” executive directormultifamily apartment complex chiller cooling systems american dg energy offers several natural gas chiller system options in the size range from  to  tons unlike conventional chiller systems which use an electric motor to power a compressor driven chiller a natural gas engine driven chiller uses an internal combustion engine to power a similar compressor in a refrigeration loop this simple change in how the chiller cooling system is powered creates high efficiency along with heat recovery opportunities for the natural gas engine driven chiller system plus it reduces demand on the grid which can help alleviate high summer electric costs seasonal blackouts and electricity shortages which are primarily caused by electric chillers while absorption chiller cooling systems also use natural gas their efficiency and performance have been disappointing relative to engine driven chiller systems although a compressor driven chiller is a very efficient system for cooling a building using a natural gas engine to drive the compressor makes it even more efficient –  times more efficient than the most efficient absorption chiller as a result a natural gas engine driven chiller cooling system provides greater comfort and savings benefits of engine driven chillers there are several benefits to implementing natural gas engine driven chillers versus absorption chillers or electric chillers including efficiency system footprint and the use of natural gas fuel the primary benefit of a natural gas engine driven chiller is its high efficiency as an example a  ton system has a cop of  which is significantly more efficient than most absorption and electric based chillers on the market and certainly is much more efficient than your current system a natural gas engine driven chiller cooling system provides superior efficiency due to its the heat recovery capability the heat from the engine which powers the compressor can be captured through a heat recovery system and then utilized within the building for various applications the recovered heat can be used to heat domestic hot water laundry hot water or to provide heat for swimming pools and spas taking advantage of the heat recovery capability of a natural gas engine driven chiller provides significant fuel efficiency resulting in lower energy costs reduced operating costs and reduced carbon emissions additional benefits if converting from an electric chiller include avoidance of onpeak electric demand charges and time of day rates another benefit of a natural gas engine driven chiller is its compact size an engine driven chiller is smaller than your absorption system and has the same footprint as your electric chiller replacing your existing system won’t require additional square footage in addition a natural gas chiller cooling system can continue to operate during blackouts and brownouts throughout an emergency loss of power will not prevent the natural gas chiller from running though you still require some electricity to run pumps and fans the amount of backup power required is dramatically less than with other cooling systems finally our natural gas chiller cooling systems can also be modified to supply ice for rinks or process applications chiller system installation chiller system installation costs are not insignificant once the system is in place the property owner is responsible for its operation and maintenance requiring either internal manhours or a third party service contract for businesses with limited budgets and competing capital

onsite utility were saving  on our electricity costs it adds up to thousands of dollars in savings annually” property managermultifamily housing facility combined heat and power combined heat and power chp also known as cogeneration or distributed generation is the simultaneous production of two types of energy – heat and electricity – from one fuel source often natural gas or propane the ability to create two forms of energy from a single source offers tremendous efficiency and thus both cost savings and environmental benefits the key components of a chp system are an internal combustion reciprocating engine driving an electric generator the clean natural gas fired engine spins a generator to produce electricity the natural byproduct of the working engine is heat which is captured and used to supply space heating heating domestic hot water laundry hot water or to provide heat for swimming pools and spas the chp process is very similar to an automobile where the engine provides the power to rotate the wheels and the byproduct heat is used to keep the passengers warm in the cabin during the winter months efficiency of chp systems combined heat and power systems use fuel very efficiently a chp system provides electricity and heat at a combined efficiency approaching  this is a significant improvement over the combination of the  efficient electric utility and a conventional heating boiler with a  seasonal efficiency why is there such a big difference in fuel efficiency between the electric utility and a combined heat and power system the electric utility and chp system each produce electricity and heat from one source of fuel however the heat produced at the electric utility is not used it goes into the cooling water or up the smokestack along with greenhouse gases and other pollutants approximately twothirds of the fuel’s energy is wasted alternatively while generating electricity a properly sized combined heat and power system recovers nearly all of the heat it produces and deploys it on site additionally when purchasing power from the electric utility a separate source of heat usually a boiler is required despite using an efficient boiler the total fuel required to produce conventional electricity and boiler heat is greater than the amount of fuel required to produce simultaneous energy with a combined heat and power system this demonstrates why chpproduced energy is more cost effective than the combined energies from the electric utility and local boilers combined heat and power chp technology has been around for over  years going back to the days of thomas edison in  the first commercial chp plant was opened utilizing a single fuel to produce both heat and electricity with an executive order signed by president obama
