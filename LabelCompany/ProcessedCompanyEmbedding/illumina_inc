beginning to unlock the power of the genome – to transform healthcare and beyond about illumina driving innovation as a startup illumina aspired to transform human health our initial products enabled researchers to explore dna at an entirely new scale helping them create the first map of gene variations associated with health disease and drug response every breakthrough opened up a new world and showed us how much further there is to go   finding answers while the rate of progress is accelerating exponentially we are only beginning to understand the clinical significance of the genome what causes a cancer cell to mutate what is the origin of a puzzling disease is it possible to prevent the next outbreak or safeguard the world’s food supply these are just a few of the challenges that inspire us to push the boundaries of our imagination making a difference now today we are a global leader in genomics – an industry at the intersection of biology and technology at the most fundamental level we enable our customers to read and understand genetic variations we strive to make our solutions increasingly simple more accessible and always reliable as a result discoveries that were unimaginable even a few years ago are now becoming routine – and are making their way into patient treatment empowering a healthy future we now have the ability to sequence at an unprecedented scale collectively this will give us a much deeper understanding of genetics than ever before we will begin to truly unlock the power of the genome these advances will trigger a fundamental shift in healthcare and beyond medicine will continue to become more preventive and more precise we will be healthier longer we have only just begun management team fact sheet investor information  find

from  genes across a large sample size the array based method allows  samples to be probed simultaneously on one array matrix infinium methylationedit utilizing illuminas humanmethylation dna analysis beadchip and the infinium technology this method allows the user to map single methylation resolution for  cpg sites across over  genes this chip has been replaced by the k methylation chip and later by the epic array covering about k sites dna sequencingedit main articles illumina solexa sequencing and illumina dye sequencing illumina sells a number of very highthroughput dna sequencing systems also known as dna sequencers based on technology developed by solexa the technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination the technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented dna to a chip followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dntp incorporation and detection the current portfolio includes the following sequencers instrument versions output in single reads genome analyzer discontinued  million miniseq research use  million miseq family research use dx fdaapproved fgx forensic
