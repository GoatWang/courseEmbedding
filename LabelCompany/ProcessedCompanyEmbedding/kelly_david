absorbing the tunes which remind me of swamps and water and thingsread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starshighly spectacular and adventurous sea expeditionbyrichard gurtleron january  format audio cddebut album of kelly david colorado based sound journeyer is dated back to  and released on his own rocky mountain records broken voyage is initiated with minute overture entitled off the map and sculpted by highly attractive industrial elements mors codes strange voice samples field recordings and drones all wrapped in richly colored and freshly effective alterations and movements sailing through various territories ranging from atmospheric industrial through rhythminfused to ultra deep droning an amazing start of this spectacular sea expedition coastwatcher is observed though deep misty sceneries by cavernous heavy drone mastery enriched with diverse beaconing environmental sounds another superb piece dense drones overlap to the next composition a plus minutes long opus shadow side featuring as guests steve roach electro groove and kailani yaksich hand percussion soon we hear invading echoed primal rumbling sounds welcoming us in deeply mysterious realms later we are shifted into trancey groove heavy beats sounding like a speedy train roaring down the tracks but around th minute the texture glides into slightly peaceful floating structure colored with industrial rumblings and gurglings transmission voices and trancey grooves hidden on the background but always extensively textured and effectively intense certainly another masterful performance buka passage again with both above guests in action is flavored with strong organics where softly tinkling bells and aerial washes become at times more massive gently colorful and extremely tranquil soundscaping highly mesmerizing trancey cyber grooves fragrance the following piece cargo cult presenting a new guest michael brugman on guitar again moving across diverse passages from minimal pulses and beats through more dramatic and massive to experimentally eclectic funkycharged ventures with buzzing electric guitar kelly david at his most adventurous and weird coastwatcher reprise is wrapped in celestial atmosonics and enriched by gradually spiraling dramatic passages a fine outro i dont know how much praised was this album after its release by the audience but i feel this amazingly distinguished work showcasing tremendous talent and potential of its creator still remains unexplored undeservingly only two albums are on kelly davids credit but both of them are topnotch this guy definitely deserves much more attention as a bonus you get with broken voyage top sound quality mixing by steve roach and mastering by roger king and stunningly looking artwork designed by sam rosenthal broken voyage is without any doubt a hidden treasure and just the same as with kelly davids second angkor album i still keep on dreaming about his next sonic wizardryrichard gürtler jan   bratislava slovakiaread more comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa journey of images and emotionsbymichael hugoson february  format audio cdkelly david is masterful in the way that his music evokes a sense of place the first piece on the cd off the map provides the setting for the pieces that follow one hears what could be explosions in the distance the sound of a hurried passage through dense jungle and a feeling of panic then sounds that seem like the dots and dashes of morse code heard faintly through a radio headset again off in the distance and coming closer is what could be the chugging of an engine it brings to mind a boat moving along the coast looking for someonethe names of the pieces that follow such as coastwatcher shadow side and buka passage remind me of the story of the austrailian coastwatchers in the solomon islands of the south pacific during world war ii the coastwatchers lived and hid in the jungle as the japanese invaded the islands and radioed back information on the movement of troops ships and planes they had to keep moving to avoid capture i have often wondered what kind of mental and emotional journey that experience would createeach piece explores a different facet of that journey in coastwatcher there is a feeling of calm and an awareness of the the landscape that surrounds you this awareness leads to a meditative serenity shadow side explores how that feeling of serenity is invaded by unseen fears there is the ebb and flow of imagery that goes from peaceful to ominous and back again in buka passage one gets the feeling of looking out across a panorama of islands and water and sunlight one hears the rhythmic sound of what could be waves washing on the shore in the piece cargo cult the mood builds to become almost festive and then fades away againi highly recommend this cd it is the beginning of what i hope will be a long and productive journey for kelly david i look forward to his next workread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusesee all verified purchase
