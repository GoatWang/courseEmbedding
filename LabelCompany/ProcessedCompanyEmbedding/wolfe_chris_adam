him  incidentally if there is any way to get a naturopathic dr at this event too that would be great  chris earlier advice on how one of those specialists had helped him to determine which food options were not good for his genetic makeup was really good  i did the same thing after hearing his advice and that has made an amazing difference in what foods cause inflammation for my genetic makeup for chris it was almonds i believe but for me it was milkdairy products  fortunately wine is on the ok list so look forward to seeing you in napa login or register to post comments fri aug

hardcopy price   real movement ebook price   real movement is the first book to define true integrated human motion within the context of motor control theory  adam wolf synthesizes his experiences in the movement industry into a digestible introduction to integrated motion while providing assessment and progression strategies  in this book adam dives into understanding the interconnectedness of the body within a framework where bones move joints feel or perceive motion and myofascia reacts to control the movement all while being governed by the nervous system the reader will gain an understanding that the site of the injury typically isn’t the cause of the injury and is often the result of something doing too much because something above or below isn’t doing enough indepth discussion includes qualities of integrated movement naming d joint motion introduction to motor control theories exercisemovement glossary current research on fascia and its influence movement clinical considerations sections with key points highlighted in each section additional readings list at the end of each chapter improving fascial highway systems video stream price   adam wolf’s real movement fascial highways video an adjunct to the new book real movement this video was supplied by the presenter and is not an otp productionthe understanding of fascia has seen many developments in recent years we now know the body made up of an integrated system of fascial connections allows combinations of tissue to lengthen together in order to control forces while efficiently effectively controlling movement in current pain science it’s now understood that the site of pain isn’t necessarily the cause of the pain—a limitation in one area affects the whole it’s also recognized that pain produces inhibition therefore as we understand the principles of motor control theories we can prescribe the correct combination of mobility and stability movements on an individual basis to help correct a problematic movement pattern the body exists in d and must control gravity ground reaction forces mass and momentum this video lecture and workshop explores fascia from the lens of integrated movement and motor control principles the handson course teaches a principlebased approach to assess and test the relationships between muscles and fascial lines while learning manual therapy techniques designed to improve overall function additionally adam teaches strategies to load specific movements to improve tissue mobility using a principlestrategyapplication process in

your view of movement” dr perry nickelston dc nkt sfma founder stop chasing pain adam teaches— assessing fascial highways using integrated movement for all patient populations mobility issues manual and selfmyofascial release techniques structurespecific assessments for motion mobility and stability links in the chain why the site of pain isn’t always the cause of the pain corrective techniques design solutions and specific therapeutic exercises for stability limitations objectives identify anterior posterior and lateral flexibility fascial highway function and discuss how these relate to movement describe the principlebased assessment approach for bioindividuality global local and essentials of observation examine the effects of specific fascial changes such as injury myofascial restructuring altered movement patterns and dysfunction understand and discuss principles of motor control and the relationship of pain and inhibition discuss structurespecific integrated assessment techniques to test motion mobility and stability of the hip lumbopelvic complex and thoracic spine correctly distinguish differences between reactive and traditional anatomy relative to integrated movement successfully leave with treatment strategies for each body part or segment “anyone who has worked with adam would initially characterize him as a “healer” and that would not remotely capture his brilliance adam is so much more than that he intuitively understands that no modality no method nor procedure can outperform your body’s ability to heal itself adam is a facilitator and teacher who guides his patients’ intuitive abilities to heal themselves with a deep understanding between muscles bones nerves tendons and spirit and this book is a demonstration of that” marc davis year nba referee this is a threepart video set— a day handson workshop filmed and edited down to  hours and  minutes video one  minutes what is optimal function if dysfunctional a combination of movement

create a reaction defining vectors of motion relative to how to name motion transformational zones and how motion is assessed at transformational zones bone position and joint motion are different a foot that’s collapsed should still go through more collapsion it’s the difference between motion and position discussion of bones spinning around axis in planes of motion front foot in gait is bottomup motion back foot in gait is topdown motion continued discussion of naming motion at a joint bones move in the same direction and one moves faster or slower relative to the first transformational zone at the hip and knee assessing knee internal rotation at the first transformational zone biomechanics of the second transformational zone of hip  pelvis topdown motion assessing hip motion at nd transformational zone discussion of postsurgery knee extension and influence of soleus length  capsule tightness that limits knee extension during gait definition of tensegrity relative to the human body discussion of chemical reaction of how tissue binds together and importance of slide and gliding of tissue understanding how a flat foot will influence motion in the back hip and shoulder and truing the system strategies to assess flexibility highways plus progressions and regressions video two  minutes using fascial highways as a warmup static to dynamic spectrum of

relationship between upregulated and downregulated tissue discussion of motor control principles and how stretching might be inhibiting tissue further and causing more dysfunction foot assessment paper card test for intrinsic foot muscles related to motor control ability to map the cortical system to have independency and not interdependency discussion on the process that occurs when someone is in pain the importance of naming it to tame it introduction discussion of pain science and not creating sympathetic responses in the system pain gate theory mobility vs stability—increase mobility
