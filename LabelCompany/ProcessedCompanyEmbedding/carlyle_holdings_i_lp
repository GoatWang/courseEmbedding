to as solutions corporate private equity  our corporate private equity segment advises our  buyout and  growth capital funds which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials as of december   our corporate private equity segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum global market strategies  our global market strategies segment advises a group of  funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit distressed debt corporate and energy mezzanine debt middlemarket and senior debt as well as credit emerging markets and commoditiesfocused hedge funds and a mutual fund as of december   our global market strategies segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum real assets  our real assets segment advises our nine us and internationally focused real estate funds our infrastructure fund our two power funds our international energy fund as well as our five legacy energy funds funds that we jointly advise with riverstone the segment also includes seven ngp management fee funds and three carry funds advised by ngp as of december   our real assets segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum investment solutions  our investment solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related coinvestment and secondary activities across  fund of funds vehicles on july   we acquired a  interest in alpinvest on august   we acquired the remaining  equity interest in alpinvest on november   we acquired metropolitan real estate equity management llc metropolitan one of the largest managers of indirect investments in global real estate which manages  fund of funds vehicles additionally on february   we acquired diversified global asset management corporation dgam a global manager of fund of hedge funds vehicles which manages  fund of funds vehicles as of december   our investment solutions segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion billion in feeearning aum we earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds we also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income which we refer to as a carried interest in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise however for segment reporting purposes we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds accordingly our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees performance fees consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations investment income including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities as well as interest and other income our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses including salaries bonuses performance payment arrangements and equitybased compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments and general and administrative expenses refer to note  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to us gaap and our financial results for segment reporting purposes trends affecting our business we believe that on an annual basis our diversified multiproduct global platform which invests across numerous industries asset classes and geographies generally enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund investment or vintage however our results of operations particularly our quarterly results are affected by a variety of factors including global economic market and financial conditions particularly in the united states europe and asia in general a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our carry funds but periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth for our hedge funds opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility these strategies include but are not limited to low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets differences in market prices versus fundamental value and opportunities to profit from trading inefficiencies during  the general economic climate started the year weaker but by the second half of the year the us macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly  at an annualized rate this acceleration in growth helped to offset the  contraction in the first quarter of  and bring gdp growth for the year to roughly  economic strength in the second half of the year contributed to an  increase in the sp  index for the year stock markets outside of the us were generally weaker in  with the eurostoxx index up by  the msci exus index down by  and the msci emerging index down by  the us dollar strengthened against almost all other currencies in  with gains of  versus the japanese yen and the euro and  versus the chinese yuan renminbi on a tradeweighted basis the us dollar rose by  for  the increase in the value of the us dollar likely will depress the foreign earnings of us businesses which could cause asset prices to decline or valuation ratios to increase further while this may pressure the us dollar values of our assets and portfolio outside the united states we also expect it to create opportunities for our funds to invest in assets at more reasonable prices than have been available over the past several years in october  the federal reserve ended its large scale asset purchase program and has signaled its intention to raise interest rates during  depending on the results of incoming economic data during the year despite the expected increase in policy rates marketbased interest rates generally declined in  with the year yield falling from  at the end of  to just  in early  yields on year german and japanese government debt fell to  and  respectively by january  the decline in interest rates has been partially due to increased monetary accommodation in japan and the expectation that the european central bank will launch an asset purchase program in the first quarter of  some of the considerations informing our strategic decisions include our ability to grow our feeearning aum during the year ended december   we raised more than  billion of new capital commitments across our fund platform although the time required to raise a fund remains lengthened relative to historical years prior to the recession and the environment is competitive our fundraising levels exceeded expectations in  during which several of our larger funds were in the market if our fundraising levels decline this decline also will impact our feeearning aum our feeearning aum declined from  billion in  to  billion in  primarily due to large distributions from our funds stemming from significant exit activity during  we expect that much of our fundraising will come from midsize funds and we will continue to sell remaining investments in many of the older larger buyout funds which may make it difficult to grow feeearning aum in our openended funds to the extent we face significant investor redemptions that are not replaced with subscriptions our feeearning aum would be adversely impacted effective january   we had  billion net redemptions in our gms hedge fund operations furthermore from time to time we may raise funds or managed accounts where we take fees on invested capital rather than on committed capital so we will not earn any fees from such commitments until we make an investment as of december   we also had  billion of newly raised capital for which we have not yet commenced charging management fees to the extent we fail to grow our feeearning aum our management fee revenues also will be adversely impacted our ability to offer and market differentiated products that engage new fund investors our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven in part by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally and our investment products specifically as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation we continually seek to create avenues to meet our investors evolving needs and broaden the appeal of our investment products by offering an expansive range of investment funds developing new products and creating managed accounts and other investment vehicles tailored to our investors goals one area of recent attention has been the expansion of access to our products for a new base of individual fund investors including through the launch of a mutual fund we utilize both external strategies including the use of feeder funds and other registered investment products and our internal team of lp relations professionals to reach out to and expand our investor base we have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to maintain our existing relationships further develop external avenues to reach investors and support our lp relations personnel which could increase our fundraising costs our successful deployment of capital our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to deploy successfully the capital that our investors have committed to our investment funds greater competition high valuations cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments because we maintain a disciplined investment approach and analyze each carry fund transaction based on our ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk we will not deploy our capital until we have sourced a suitable investment opportunity at an attractive price we have a longterm investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year during  we invested approximately  billion in new and existing investments in our carry funds over the past five years we have invested an average of more than  billion a year in new and existing investments in our carry funds as of december   we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of  billion our ability to generate strong absolute and risk adjusted returns the strength of our investment performance affects investors willingness to commit capital to our funds the capital we are able to attract is one of the main drivers of the growth of our aum and the management fees we earn during the year ended december   we realized proceeds of approximately  billion for our carry fund investors our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains the portion of the fund invested the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors and the length of time the fund has been in carry as well as other qualitative measures the valuation of our carry fund portfolio increased  overall during  with a  increase in our corporate private equity segment a  increase in our global market strategies segment and a  decline in our real assets segment the decline in real assets was primarily driven by depreciation in funds in our energy platform in late  but was partially mitigated by the lower economics of our interests in the performance fees from our legacy energy funds as opposed to the enhanced economics we hold in funds in our broadened energy and natural resources platform we believe that this broadened platform will provide significant opportunities for future returns on our investment as we seek to deploy significant capital into the sector at current attractive values given increased competition for investments and the effect particularly in europe and asia of the rising dollar against foreign currencies the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation recent transactions on february   the fasb issued asu  consolidation topic  key financial measures management fees attributable to carlyle partners
