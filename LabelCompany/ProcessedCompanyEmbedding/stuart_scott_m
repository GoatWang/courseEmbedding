youre fired microsoft dumps cio for monkey business homeautogadgetshardwareinternetitsciencesoftwareblogspolls submit news it youre fired microsoft dumps cio for monkey business jason mick blog  november    am print recipient email please enter a valid email addressplease enter a valid email address sender email please enter a valid email addressplease enter a valid email address stuart scott joined microsoft in   source microsoft corp microsoft just shook up its corporate architecture with a highprofile firing microsoft corp announced yesterday the shocking news that it had fired its cio of two years stuart scott  they disclosed that scott had violated corporate policies but would not mention details a microsoft spokesperson simply stated we can confirm that stuart scotts employment with microsoft has been terminated after an investigation for violation of company policies the news came as somewhat of a bombshell as scott was behaving last week as if it were business as normal attending the informationweek  conference and giving a speech with his boss microsoft coo kevin turner still despite the cool exterior scott had been the topic of over a month of rumors which indicated that microsoft may have placed him on administrative leave  the recent report released by microsoft seems to validate these rumors scott had worked for over  years at general electric and also served as their cio  he left general electric for microsoft in   he was a corporate vice president at microsoft and began as cocio  last year he assumed sole cio responsibilities scotts responsibilities as microsoft cio involved management of the it team which oversees microsofts infrastructure security messaging and business applications  this it team also provided support for microsoft product groups corporate business groups and the global sales and marketing organization microsoft has not named a replacement but two people will be filling in for scott shahla aly general manager of worldwide services strategy and planning and alain crozier corporate vice president and chief financial officer at microsofts sales marketing and services group some speculate that scotts downfall may be partly due to the more consolidated nature of his corporate power than cios in the past  scott acknowledged this in a recent interview stating prior cios have always run the corporate systems and infrastructure for the employees  what weve added is the direct lineofbusiness systems its all part of microsoft learning how to be a big company but still remain innovative and agile the interview that this quote was taken from fueled the rumors of his impending departure high level executives randomly disappearing at microsoft is not unheard of  in  highprofile market executive martin taylor left microsoft suddenly after  years with the company  still scotts departure marks the largest shakeup in recent history microsoft is coming off recent successes of its victory acquiring a stake in facebook which it ardently defends  it also recently enjoyed its strongest quarter since   scotts departure will likely due little to dampen microsofts good spirits but it may add a hint of uncertainty to the corporate atmosphere of the tech giant the space elevator will be built about  years after everyone stops laughing  sir arthur c clarke related articles microsoft claims
