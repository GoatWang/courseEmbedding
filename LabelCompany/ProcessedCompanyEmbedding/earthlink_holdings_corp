together with our consolidated subsidiaries is a leading managed network security and cloud services provider to business and residential customers in the united states we provide a broad range of data voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers we also provide nationwide internet access and related valueadded services to residential customers we operate an extensive network including more than  route miles of fiber and  metro fiber rings that provide data and voice ip service coverage across more than  percent of the united states  highlights key developments in our business during  are described below generated revenues of  billion in  a  decrease during the year primarily driven by declines in traditional voice and data products discontinuing sales of certain products and mandated rate reductions partially offset by targeted price increases and increased sales of our growth products reduced cost of revenues  during  primarily due to the decline in revenues noted above as well as a concentrated effort to manage cost of revenues through network grooming auditing telecommunications vendor invoices and other cost saving initiatives generated a net loss of  million in  a decrease from a net loss of  million in the prior year which reflects an increase in adjusted ebitda as described below generated adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure see nongaap financial measures in this item  of  million in  an increase from  million in the prior year primarily due to improvements in our cost of revenues and operating expenses resulting from various cost savings initiatives partially offset by the decrease in revenues noted above made capital expenditures of  million in  a  reduction from the prior year primarily due to improving our processes and being more efficient as well as a decrease in customer additions redeemed or repurchased  million of outstanding debt for  million during  and drew down  million net of repayments under our senior secured revolving credit facility made  million of dividend payments to shareholders in  change in reportable segments we have historically operated two reportable segments business services and consumer services our business services segment provided a broad range of data voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers our consumer services segment provided nationwide internet access and related valueadded services to residential customers during  we implemented certain organizational operational and reporting changes that resulted in the disaggregation of our business services segment into three separate reportable segments enterprisemidmarket small business and carriertransport our consumer services segment was not impacted our new reportable segments are strategic business units aligned around distinct customer categories we reorganized our organization around these business units to optimize operations we believe this structure allows for better management accountability and decision making while providing greater visibility to our chief operating decision maker we began reporting the disaggregated information to our chief operating decision maker during the third quarter of  we now operate the following four reportable segments table of contents enterprisemidmarket our enterprisemidmarket segment provides a broad range of data voice and managed network services to distributed multisite business customers small business our small business segment provides a broad range of data voice and managed network services to small often singlesite business customers carriertransport our carriertransport segment provides transmission capacity and other data voice and managed network services to telecommunications carriers and large enterprises consumer services our consumer services segment provides nationwide internet access and related valueadded services to residential customers we began recording revenue and cost of revenue transactions in the new segment structure during  management determined that it is impracticable to restate financial information prior to  to conform to the new reportable segment structure due to the level of effort required to segment customers that terminated service prior to  and identify the related cost of revenue associated with those customers as this information is not currently available as a result our results of operations discussion focuses on the previous segment structure since we are able to present comparable periods for more information concerning our reportable segments see note  to our consolidated financial statements and see segment results of operations later in this mda sale of it services assets in february  we sold certain assets related to our it services product offerings in connection with our strategy to simplify our operations and provide more flexibility to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth in our core business the purchase price in the transaction was  million subject to postclosing contingencies we received  million of cash upon completion of the sale the other  million of consideration was deposited into an escrow account to fund potential indemnification obligations the loss of revenues related to our it services product offerings will contribute to our revenue declines in  business strategy operate each of our business units with focused valueoptimizing strategies during  we aligned our organization around four distinct business units which are enterprisemidmarket small business carriertransport and consumer we believe this concentrates our resources and investments into areas that will drive growth and deliver improved performance enable each business to compete more successfully in the market and provide strategic optionality we are focused on operating each business unit with valueoptimizing strategies which are managing the decline in our small business and consumer services business units and investing the cash flow to grow our enterprisemidmarket and carriertransport business units optimize our cost structure and cash flows we are focused on optimizing our cost structure and maximizing our cash flows this includes managing our cost of revenues and operating expenses streamlining our internal processes and aligning our workforce to current revenue trends it also includes the repayment andor refinancing of debt in order to reduce our interest expense we plan to use the cash flow generated from our improvement efforts to continue to optimize our balance sheet and invest in growth invest in growth business products marketing and sales our growth business products are multiprotocol label switching mpls hosted voice hybrid wan and managed network security and cloud services for multilocation businesses and transport services for other communications carriers and enterprises we are focused on investing in product and service capabilities and sales and marketing initiatives to support these growth products evaluate potential strategic transactions we continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions in order to accelerate our transformation we believe that targeted acquisitions when available at the right economics can be an effective means for growth and targeted capability building in addition we continue to evaluate our business which could lead us to discontinue or divest nonstrategic products assets or customers based on managements assessment of their strategic value to our business table of contents challenges and risks the primary challenges we face in executing on our business strategy are growing revenues from our growth products and services reducing churn in our existing customer base responding to competition aligning costs with trends in our revenues and ensuring adequate resources to invest in growth to address these challenges we are taking the following actions targeting larger multilocation retail and service businesses which have lower churn profiles as well as a need for our product and services investing in new products and service capabilities to create value for our customers in particular our cloudbased offerings focusing on customer contract reterm efforts retention offers targeted price increases and opportunities to upsell products and services improving the customer experience to increase customer satisfaction and further enhance customer retention continuing to refine and narrow our product portfolio implementing cost efficiencies such as network grooming and workforce alignment and seeking to make costs more variable repaying andor refinancing outstanding indebtedness in order to reduce interest expense considering further divestitures of nonstrategic products assets or customers in order to continue to simplify our operations and generate cash to reduce debt or to use for other strategic needs trends in our business our financial results are impacted by several significant trends which are described below industry factors the communications industry is characterized by intense competition changing technology and changes in customer needs an evolving regulatory environment and industry consolidation resulting in larger competitors and fewer suppliers we expect these trends to continue more recently trends in the industry have included increased demand for data evolving security threats the adoption of cloud computing and the increased use of outsourcing we are trying to capitalize on these changes by focusing on our managed network security and cloud services and transport services traditional business voice and data products our traditional business voice and data revenues have been declining due to competition migration to more advanced integrated voice and data services and mandated rate reductions we expect this trend to continue we have also experienced an increase in churn for these products however we are focused on decelerating these declines through customer retention efforts contract renewals upselling products and services and offering new services consumer access declines our consumer access subscriber base and revenues have been declining and are expected to continue to decline due to the continued maturation of the market for internet access competition from cable dsl and wireless providers and limited sales and marketing activities in addition we have implemented and expect to continue to implement targeted price increases which could negatively impact our churn rates however we are focused on customer retention and as a result we expect the rate of churn to continue to generally decline as our customer base becomes longer tenured operating costs and expenses we have experienced declines in cost of revenues and operating expense due to various cost saving initiatives and lower sales of traditional voice and data products we are focused on continuing to optimize our cost structure to offset pressures on revenue however we may not be able to continue to achieve the level of cost savings we have been experiencing and there will be decreasing opportunities for cost savings in the future dispute settlements due to the nature of our industry we are regularly involved in disputes related to our billings to other carriers for access to our network and network access charges that we are assessed by other companies the disputes often take significant time to resolve and they may be resolved or require adjustment in future periods although they relate to costs and revenues in prior periods we have experienced an increase in dispute settlements impacting revenues and cost of revenues over the past few years however this trend may not continue at the

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
