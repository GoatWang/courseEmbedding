exceptional leaders gives gtcr a differentiated perspective on investment opportunities craig bondy managing directorgtcr identifying the right leader is the critical difference in building marketleading companies as a leading private equity firm gtcr pioneered the leaders strategy™—finding and partnering with management leaders in core domains to identify acquire and build marketleading companies through transformational acquisitions and organic growth this differentiated approach has stood at the core of gtcr’s investment strategy for more than  years partnering with leaders » leveraging domain expertise » executing transformation » partnering with leaders sourcing and creating partnerships with exceptional leaders is the foundation of the leaders strategy™ frequently these partnerships are started solely on the basis of a strong investment thesis even before an initial platform acquisition is identified in other instances we partner with strong incumbent management teams to provide them capital to execute transformational opportunities like acquiring a significant competitor partnering with proven leaders can provide distinct and proprietary advantages in the investment process and can mitigate risk our leaders strategy™ teams are experienced established leaders in their domains we believe these leaders’ industry insights can provide informational advantages in the acquisition duediligence process and that their execution track record and reputation can facilitate improved acquisition financing execution in addition our leaders strategy™ teams can become preferred buyers within their domains which can lead to attractive followon acquisition opportunities importantly our leaders strategy™ teams are positioned to recruit the most talented people in their industries this creates the opportunity to drive strong sales effectiveness while optimizing costs the combined effect of which can be significant improvements in operating profits all of these elements can come together to create marketingleading companies with strategic significance which can result in attractive strategic or public exit opportunities leveraging domain expertise as a result of focused efforts over our year history gtcr’s highly resourceful resultsdriven teams have developed deep domain expertise within financial services  technology healthcare technology media  telecommunications and growth business services because we’ve focused on these areas for multiple decades we have developed critical industry knowledge credibility and strong networks of relationships that can help us identify unique investment opportunities gtcr investment teams consistently leverage this experience and insight to develop specific actionable investment ideas within these domains at the same time our history and reputation in these areas allow us to continually meet with and evaluate both seasoned and upandcoming management leaders the essence of gtcr’s leaders strategy™ is to bring together these two activities—researchbased investment thesis development and proactive executive networking through thesis development within our four areas of domain expertise we find and develop actionable investment ideas we seek to identify emerging inflection points and trends that can lead us to underappreciated or underperforming businesses at the same time we seek to position ourselves to better evaluate both the risks and the potential in new investment opportunities through rigorous executive networking and recruiting in our domains we strive to identify and partner with the very best leadership teams—the teams capable of driving the execution of the transformation opportunities that we identify through the thesis development process when these two efforts come together we have an opportunity to execute truly transformational investments and build important durable market and industryleading companies that have strategic value executing transformation gtcr’s leaders strategy™ brings together proactive investment thesis development and proactive executive networking with the objective of identifying opportunities to execute transformational investments the leadership teams we seek to partner with drive operational transformation in undermanaged or underoptimized businesses by upgrading human capital and rigorously developing and focusing on sales execution and resource allocation through the use of key performance indicators through this process successful leaders strategy™ teams are able to improve operating efficiency and importantly accelerate revenue growth the leaders strategy™ also helps position gtcr to invest in complex corporate carveouts which tend to be extremely managementintensive to execute in these situations leaders strategy™ teams need to recreate critical functions for the acquired company on a standalone basis we believe creating a company with a singular strategy and focus helps to accelerate financial performance and enhance value our leadership teams are skilled at identifying executing and integrating acquisitions acquisitions can help drive transformation by increasing both the scale and scope of a company they can also accelerate geographic customer and product expansion while facilitating fixedcost leverage and critically acquisitions can often be executed at accretive valuations the increased scope and scale that acquisitions can accelerate facilitate more efficient capital structures and ultimately value creation     gtcr llc all rights reserved terms of use

building a diversified portfolio through proprietary acquisitions ed fiorentino    actient pharmaceuticals actient pharmaceuticals was a management partnership formed with ed fiorentino a former senior executive at abbott laboratories to acquire specialty pharmaceutical companies and products as part of gtcr’s leaders strategy™ in less than three years actient completed five proprietary acquisitions and built a unique diversified portfolio of commercial products and pipeline assets focused on the treatment of urological indications actient was formed in  based on gtcr’s thesis that the pharmaceutical industry was an attractive area for investment given several positive trends including an aging population increasing availability of drugs for new indications and increasing prescription drug coverage in addition nearterm growth challenges among mid and largecap pharmaceutical companies resulted in significant industry consolidation leading to product divestitures as these companies attempted to reprioritize their portfolios and shed noncore assets based on mr fiorentino’s industry experience at abbott we believed actient was well positioned to evaluate these attractive divestiture opportunities and ultimately build a leading specialty business through acquisitions of marketed products and companies the actient strategy focused on acquiring undermanaged products thereby creating an opportunity to grow and preserve these assets through targeted promotion strategies and life cycle management programs in july  actient closed its first proprietary transaction a corporate carveout of six onmarket products from ucb pharma the transaction provided actient with a strategic asset in the urology space and an opportunity to establish a commercial platform with stable cash flows that could be leveraged through additional acquisitions in january  actient acquired timm medical technologies a leader in urology medical devices the acquisition of timm enabled actient to expand its urology presence by offering both pharmaceutical and medical device solutions in april  actient followed up the timm deal with the acquisition of the product striant

product testopel testosterone pellets for implantation one of the fastestgrowing products in one of the fastestgrowing segments of the pharmaceutical industry the acquisition complemented actient’s strategic focus broadening the portfolio of leading products marketed to urologists six months later in june  actient acquired bartor pharmacal the bartor acquisition helped to secure the manufacturing of testopel and reduce cost of goods sold in less than three years through five proprietary acquisitions and organic growth we believe actient became one of the fastestgrowing pharmaceutical companies the management team faced a number of challenges in building the company ranging from sourcing and completing acquisitions to manufacturing and growing sales of its products

known cure cbr’s attractive commercial model – comprised of an upfront processing fee and longterm annual storage fees – provides strong revenue visibility and recurring cash flow with minimal

significant piece of healthcare legislation since the balanced budget amendment of  “bba” looking to leverage gtcr’s deep experience in managed healthcare services we targeted healthcare industry niches that would benefit from the mma legislation and identified privately sponsored medicare advantage “ma” plans as one such area while the bba had significantly cut reimbursement to these plans in  the mma restored reimbursement in a number of ways that encouraged private plans to provide attractive options to seniors at that time officials at cms the federal healthcare regulatory agency were supporting the continued privatization of medicare and we believed wellmanaged healthcare companies in the ma industry would enjoy strong growth and profitability over the ensuing years during  gtcr

platform managing higherquality patient care at lower costs in addition to mr fritch’s strong leadership and the quality of his team we found the healthspring platform to be attractive for several

building on the firm’s expertise and track record of success in the healthcare sector gtcr focused on the specialty pharmaceutical industry in the late s gtcr strongly believed the specialty pharmaceutical industry was poised for significant secular growth and offered an opportunity to establish an attractive recurring revenue business through the acquisition of products with fda market exclusivity intellectual property protection and other attractive attributes at this time ma activity in the pharmaceutical industry was robust after a wave of large pharmaceutical mergers in the s many large diversified pharmaceutical companies were rationalizing their drug portfolios selling small noncore drugs servicing niche markets this trend increased acquisition and inlicensing opportunities for smaller specialty pharmaceutical companies at the same time many midsized and large pharmaceutical companies had significant cash balances and were willing to pay full value for
