of the practical real estate lawyera growing number of state and federal initiatives hold the hope of developing brownfields into properties that are useful and safe once moreprivate parties have been reluctant to purchase or finance brownfields sites because of uncertainty over the amount of contamination at a site applicable cleanup standards likely cleanup costs potential third party lawsuits undiscovered contamination and potential regulatory reopeners congressional gridlock over reauthorization of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  usc § et seq cercla has only aggravated this situation motivating developers and industry to move from urban areas into suburban greenfieldsfaced with a quickly eroding urban job and tax base state and local officials have aggressively developed alternative approaches to bring these contaminated properties back into productive use buyers sellers and lenders are now being provided with greater certainty about future liability and cleanup costs as well as financial incentives to invest in brownfields the results have been good for the environment good for the community and good for the businesses involved in the development of real estatebrownfields and the new lawcongress has defined a brownfield site as real property the expansion redevelopment or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant  usc §a the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act revitalization act the us environmental protection agency epa has previously defined brownfields as abandoned idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination estimates of the number of brownfields sites have ranged from the tens of thousands to  see office of technology assessments state of the states on brownfields programs for cleanup and reuse of contaminated sites   sites now include minescarred lands petroleumcontaminated sites and sites contaminated with controlled substances  usc §diii iiiwhat the act doesthe revitalization act is likely to affect the way in which property is bought and sold and the way in which parties seek recovery of cleanup costs at existing superfund sites for years to come key changes are discussed belowexemptions from cercla liabilitythe law clarifies that a bona fide prospective purchaser is exempt from liability even if it has knowledge of the existence of contamination at a site after conducting all appropriate inquiry this is an important exemption from liability for brownfields redevelopers this provision became effective on the date of enactment and applies if the prospective purchaser can show by a preponderance of the evidence thatall disposal occurred prior to the time that it acquired ownership and  it made all appropriate inquiry into the prior uses of the property in accordance with good commercial and customary standards and practices  the prospective purchaser would also need to show that it had  made all legally required disclosures  taken reasonable steps to stop any continuing release and prevent any future releases and  not impeded the effectiveness or integrity of any institutional controls  if the property will be used for residential purposes the standard will have been met if the facility inspection and title search have revealed no basis for further investigation defensesthe law contains two other exemptions from liability the innocent landowner defense and the contiguous landowner defense the party claiming these defenses would have the burden of proving that it had not caused contributed to or consented to the release it would also need to show that it had taken the reasonable steps regarding all appropriate inquiry  disclosures prevention of releases and maintenance of institutional controls discussed above the innocent landowner and contiguous property owner defenses would not apply if the property owner had prior knowledge of the contaminationcontaminated aquifersthe law also codifies the epas may  policy regarding contaminated aquifers see epa policy toward owners of property containing contaminated aquifers  fed reg  july   the law provides that a contiguous property owner shall not be required to conduct ground water investigations or to install ground water remediation systems except in accordance with epas  policyall appropriate inquirycongress has clarified that a phase i environmental site assessment conducted on or after may   in accordance with astm e  will constitute all appropriate inquiry under cercla at least until epa promulgates its own regulations among other things the property owner must not have taken any action to impair any institutional controls that were placed on the site congress has further directed epa to develop its own regulations regarding what constitutes all appropriate inquiry within the next two yearsaffirmative obligations to comply with institutional controls and prevent releasesthe law clarifies that property owners have an affirmative obligation to maintain institutional controls that may have been imposed on contaminated property the law further provides that property owners have an affirmative duty to prevent releases to qualify for any of the three exemptions innocent landowner contiguous landowner or bona fide prospective purchaser from cercla liabilitywindfall profit lien provisionthe law provides that epa may impose a lien on contaminated property where epa has incurred response costs to recover any windfall profit resulting from the increase in the fair market value the lien arises at the time that epa begins a response action but epa would need to go into court at the time the property is sold to perfect its liende micromis and municipalsolid waste exemptions from liability parties contributing less than  gallons of liquid materials or  pounds of solid hazardous materials that were sent to a national priorities list npl site before to april   will enjoy the de micronis exemption from liability the government may make an exception to this exemption ifit determines that the materials contributed significantly to the cost of the response action  the respondent failed to comply with an information request or impeded the performance of a response action or  the respondent has been convicted of a criminal violation  the governments decisions under the first two bulleted items above are not subject to judicial review small waste generatorsin addition residential households businesses employing no more than  fulltime employees and section c organizations employing no more than  paid individuals at the location that generated the solid waste who disposed of municipal solid waste only at an npl site will be exempt from liability the government may make an exception to this exemption ifit determines that the materials contributed significantly to the cost of the response action or  the respondent failed to comply with an information request or impeded tie performance of a response action the governments decisions regarding eligibility for the exemption are not subject to judicial reviewburden of proofthe statute clarifies who will bear the burden of proof in an enforcement action if the government brings the enforcement action the burden of proof will rest upon the party claiming the exemption however in private litigation the burden will rest upon the plaintiff to prove that the party claiming the exemption is not entitled to it in addition new language in the law will allow the prevailing party to recover its attorneys fees in private litigationstate inventory of sitesstates that wish to obtain brownfields grant funding must ensure that their response programs include mechanisms formaintaining an inventory of brownfields sites  sustaining adequate enforcement authorities that will ensure that response actions including longterm operation and maintenance activities will be completed and  providing for meaningful public notice and participation in addition a state may not receive funding unless it maintains and makes available to the public a record of brownfields sites federal enforcement deferralepa will not take enforcement action against a site that is an eligible response site unless the state requests federal assistance  the contamination has migrated across state lines  after taking into account the actions that have been taken epa determines that the release presents an imminent and substantial endangerment and that additional remedial action is needed or  there is new information that was not known at the time the initial cleanup was approved or completed eg that the contamination at the site is more toxic than originally expected  this deferral authority applies only if the state  maintains a record of sites where response actions have been completed  indicates whether the site is suitable for unrestricted use and  identifies any institutional controls relied upon in the remedy this deferral provision applies only to those response actions conducted after february  nonbrownfieldsunder the law many types of sites do not constitute brownfields sites includingany site listed on the npl  any site undergoing a removal action  any facility subject to a unilateral administrative order court order administrative order on consent or judicial consent decree  any facility which has received a permit under the clean water act the safe drinking water act the solid waste disposal act or the toxic substances control act  any site undergoing corrective action or subject to closure under rcra and  any site where there has been a release of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs the government may determine on a casebycase basis that some but not all of the sites excluded from the brownfields definition may nevertheless be eligible for fundingkey provisions of the statutehr  which combines elements of s  passed by the senate in april  and hr  passed by the house in may  enjoyed widespread support when it moved through congress it provides the following types of financial incentives and exemptions from liabilityfinancial assistancethe financial assistance provisions state that million per year will be provided for the next five years for a total of  billion to fund brownfields cleanups the language in the bill is an authorization not an appropriation so epa dogs not expect to have the additional funds in its budget until fy    million per year of these funds will be used to assess sites  million per year will be used to cleanup sites and the other  million will be used to cleanup sites contaminated with petroleum products nonprofit entities that own brownfield sites as well as governmental entities will be eligible to apply for the remediation funding  a local government may use up to  percent of the grant to establish a program to i monitor health or ii monitor and enforce institutional controls exemptions from liabilitythe exemption provisions state thatpersons who would otherwise be liable at an npl site based solely upon their status as a generator or transporter of hazardous substances and who contributed less than  gallons of liquid materials or less than  pounds of solid material would be exempt from liability if disposal treatment or transport occurred before april    small businesses ie those with no more than  fulltime employees owners operators and lessees of residential property and nonprofit entities would not be liable for municipal solid waste disposed of at an npl site  in a contribution action brought by a non governmental entity under either section  or  of cercla  usc § or § the burden would be on the party bringing the action to establish that the foregoing exemptions do not apply if the party is unsuccessful because the exemption in fact applies it shall pay the defendants reasonable defense costs  owners of contiguous properties who can show by a preponderance of the evidence that they did not cause or contribute to the contamination who conducted all appropriate inquiry and who complied with numerous other requirements shall be exempt from liability and  bona fide prospective purchasers shall generally be exempt from cleanup requirements but the government may impose a lien not in excess of the increase in fair market value on their property to recover any unrecovered response costs othermiscellaneous provisions include the followingbrownfields funds can be used to encourage the development of parks greenways and recreational areas  assessments and cleanups will generally be conducted under state authority and oversight   epa reserves the right to intervene in the event of an imminent and substantial endangerment and  epa is required to submit a report on the status of all brownfields sites within three years state vcps and brownfields programsvirtually every state has now developed and successfully implemented a voluntary cleanup program vcp as an alternative to the superfund cleanup process northeast midwest institute brownfields state of the states an endofsession review of initiatives and program impacts in the  states november  minnesota enacted the first such program in  minn stat ann § b  since then at least  other states and the district of columbia have adopted some type of vcp and these programs have provided the vehicle for brownfields redevelopment one of the most recent bills to become law was the alabama land recycling and economic redevelopment act which was signed into law on may   see ala code  §e et seq  in addition dc law  which was approved by the city council in the district of columbia in december  was approved by congress in  north dakota south dakota and wyoming have not adopted programs see northeastmidwest institute brownfield basics an issue primer many states have adopted separate brown fields legislation as well which has typically created empowerment zones or provided for brownfields grants loans or tax abatements see eg ohios clean ohio revitalization fund pennsylvanias hazardous sites cleanup fund and michigans brownfield redevelopment grant programthe specific details of each states vcp or brownfields program may vary dramatically but the intent in each case has been to create a mechanism for expediting the investigation and if needed the remediation of contaminated properties that might otherwise fall between the cracks and to provide buyers sellers and lenders with some certainty about potential liability for future cleanup costs or potential enforcement actionslimitations on liabilitya common element of the state vcps has been the effort to clarify who has liability and when many of these state programs specifically exempt innocent parties such as lenders who have not contributed to the release fiduciaries prospective purchasers easement holders and the like see eg texas voluntary cleanup program tex health  safety code ann § et seq  and virginias voluntary remediation program va code ann § et seq clarification of cleanup requirements and levelsin the past interested parties have frequently had a difficult time determining how much investigation or remediation might be required under the applicable regulatory programs now many of the state vcps use a tiered risk based approach to cleanup for example under the massachusetts contingency plan mcp the cleanup goal is no significant risk to human health safety public welfare or the environment see mass gen laws ann ch e §aj  the mcp outlines three approaches for determining whether the no significant risk level has been achieved method  method  or method  method  is a look up table providing dear numeric standards for  chemicals commonly found in soil or ground water method  allows for some adjustments in these numbers to account for site specific conditions method  allows cleanup standards to be determined on the basis of a sitespecific risk assessment id this tiered decisionmaking process has broken the cycle of collecting information for informations sake now parties know early in the transaction how much investigation or remediation might be required by the statestreamlined governmental review processin the past regulatory agencies were under no requirement to review and approve or disapprove environmental studies quickly this uncertainty and delay would frequently kill many real estate transactions now many of the state vcps include provisions to expedite the investigation and remediation of potentially contaminated properties in pennsylvania for example the department of environmental resources der has  days  days if a site specific cleanup number is selected in which to respond to a final environmental report see  pa cons stat ann § et seq  if it fails to do so the report is deemed approved and the applicant may proceed with the cleanup in arizona the department of environmental quality must approve deny or request additional information within  days of a request and must closeout a case within  days of submission of a final report see ariz rev stat § completion lettersin commercial real estate transactions parties have frequently argued over how to determine that enough investigation and remediation has occurred most state vcps now provide documentation of completion of the investigation or remediation these completion letters take many forms and have differing degrees of finality but they offer some certainty about the sufficiency of the work that has been done at the sitein minnesota for example there are six types of completion letters ranging from certificates of completion partial no action letters no action letters no association determinations offsite source determination letters and covenants not to sue on a sitebysite basis see minn stat ann §b  no further action letters and certificates of completion are common in other states see eg va codeann §  et seq  del code ann tit  § et seq and ch   kan stat ann § only a handful of states offer broad based covenants not to sue see eg conn gen stat ann §a et seq  ind code ann § et seq  mich comp laws ann § et seq federal and state financial incentivesboth the federal government and the states have recognized the benefits of offering financial incentives for the redevelopment of brownfields these incentives have taken the form of grants loans and tax abatements or deferrals substantial additional financial incentives are likely to be forthcoming in the futurebrownfields assessment demonstration pilot grantssince its inception in  epa has offered brownfields assessment demonstration pilot grants of up to  each to  cities states and tribes nationwide epa expects to select up to  additional national assessment pilots by april  these grants have totaled more than  million recipients have included the cities of miami florida clearwater florida baltimore maryland richmond virginia cleveland ohio knoxville tennessee fayetteville north carolina ketchikan gateway borough alaska and detroit michigan on april   epa administrator christie whitman awarded  additional grants totaling over  million as well as  million to continue and expand assessments on existing sitesadditional federal grantsepa has provided numerous other types of incentives as well such as brownfields cleanup revolving loan fund pilots with funding of up to  million over five years this included  million funds to an additional  communities in   in addition there are over  job training pilot program grants with funding of up to  each in  states the district of columbia and puerto rico  twentyeight brownfields showcase communities epa designated  brownfields showcase communities in  and an additional  brownfields showcase communities in october   fifty grants as part of its superfund redevelopment initiative with funding of up to  each wwwepagovsuperfundprogramsrecyclepilotrndexhtm  rcra brownfields redevelopment initiative pilots  hudgranted funds as part of its brown fields economic development initiative bedi wowhudgovnofasuprnofasupnof abedi html and brownfields economic development initiative bedp programs  finally congress has provided limited tax incentives for certain brownfields cleanup costs as part of the  taxpayer relief act those incentives were extended and broadened as part of the community renewal tax relief act signed by president clinton on december   see section  of the community renewal tax relief act which was adopted as part of hr  state tax incentive programsmany states have also adopted tax incentives in their brownfields programsin  the district of columbia established a voluntary cleanup program that authorizes the mayor to submit proposed rules to establish certain cleanup incentives such as tax credits to offset property taxes in connection with the cleanup and redevelopment of the property as well as to establish a contaminated property cleanup fund to provide grants and loans  in ohio hb  was adopted in  to allow credits against corporate franchise and state income taxes for any taxpayer who completes a voluntary cleanup of a brownfields site these tax credits can be either  the lesser of  or  percent of the eligible cleanup costs or  if the area is economically disadvantaged the lesser of  or  percent of the eligible cleanup costs also in  hb  created a grants program to promote land acquisition infrastructure improvements voluntary cleanup actions and renovation of properties in certain areas over the next four years the clean ohio fund will have  million available for evaluation  in pennsylvania financial assistance has been available for innocent volunteers who wish to conduct voluntary cleanups this  million fund includes grants and low interest loans which can be used to cover up to  percent of the costs of conducting an environmental investigation and cleanup the authority for the program is the hazardous sites cleanup act see  pa cons stat am § et seq  in addition  million in grants up to  per site is available to municipalities nan profit economic development agencies and similar agencies for conducting environmental assessments in areas that have been designated distressed communities   florida has provided a  tax credit for every new job created at a remediated site in addition there is a  percent tax credit of up to  per site for the costs of voluntary cleanup if those costs are integral to site rehabilitation the tax credit can be transferred to the new owner florida has also established a revolving loan trust fund providing lowinterest loans to local governments community redevelopment agencies and nonprofit corporations  illinois has established an environmental remediation tax credit in which a developer can obtain a  percent income tax credit if he deans up contamination that he did not cause the maximum credit is  per year and  per site after the first  in development costs in addition the illinois brownfields redevelopment grant program brgp offers grants worth a maximum of  each to municipalities to investigate brownfields  massachusetts has created a  million fund for environmental insurance known as the brownfield redevelopment access to capital brag program massachusetts has also enacted the massachusetts economic development incentive a five percent state investment tax credit and a  percent abandoned building tax deduction as well as remediation tax credits ranging from  cities are allowed to negotiate away back taxes industry initiativesin dealing with the brownfields problem industry responses have fallen into two major categories riskbased corrective action and new forms of insuranceriskbased corrective actionthe astm e committee has developed a guide for conducting risk based corrective action at chemical release sites rbca ii astm e  wwwastmorg this guide uses a tiered approach to integrate risk and exposure assessment practices with site assessment and remedial measure selection to ensure that the selected remedy is costeffective yet protective of human health and the environment  the basic steps in the rbca process includetier  site assessment and comparison of concentrations of chemical of concern to tier  risk based screening levels rbsls for human exposure pathways and to relevant ecological screening criteria rescs for potential ecological exposure pathways identification of any other relevant measureable criteria ormcs collectively the rbsls the rescs and the ormcs serve as the tier  corrective action goals for the site  tier  collection of site specific information and development of points of compliance and tier  corrective action goals based on the site specific target levels sstls the site specific ecological criteria ssecs or the ormcs as applicable  tier  collection of additional site specific information and development of points of compliance based upon tier  corrective action goals based on sstls ssecs or ormcs as applicable by following this decisionmaking process an interested party can avoid collecting information about a site for no specific purpose if the initial information is sufficient to determine whether the contamination poses any risk to human health or the environment then no further assessment may be needed if however more specific information about exposure pathways and toxicity assumptions is needed before a costeffective remedy can be selected more detailed and sitespecific information should be collected tier  andor tier  evaluation in this regard the astm approach provides a framework for conducting tiered risk assessments rather than specific cleanup levelsenvironmental insurance productsa number of environmental insurance products have become available on the market in the past cuple of years that help limit the risk presented by real or perceived environmental contamination these products fall into two basic categories remediation stop loss insurance and transfer insuranceremediation stop loss insurance protects the insured in the event that the costs of remediation exceed a previously agreed upon ceiling for the estimated cleanup costs or if unknown conditions are later discovered on the property  transfer insurance protects the insured against third party lawsuits and against reopeners because of regulatory changes or the discovery of unknown conditions this coverage is available for both known and unknown contamination additional federal initiativesepa has undertaken several initiatives to lessen the private sectors concerns about

epa has generally agreed to exercise its enforcement discretion with regard to sites in the states vcps wwwepagovswerospsbfpdfstatemoapdf these federal initiatives as well as section  of the new brownfields law have helped to clarify some of the superfund liability issues and to reduce the likelihood that epa will second guess voluntary cleanup actions conducted in states with a wellestablished vcpconclusionenvironmental contamination no longer needs to be a deal breaker in commercial real estate transactions particularly in those states that have welldeveloped vcps and brownfields programsthe new brownfields legislation as well as the recent administrative initiatives have gone a long way toward providing buyers sellers lenders and fiduciaries with greater certainty that they will not be caught in the superfund liability net financial incentives to deal with contaminated properties certainty about likely cleanup costs and streamlined governmental review processesas a result interested parties are now able to evaluate environmental risk in a rational manner rather than blindly abandoning even mildly contaminated properties the result is a system that is good for the environment good for the community and good for business homesite maplegal information follow us attorney advertising copyright  – holland  knight llp all rights reserved bizapediacom
