llc is the advisor to the morgan dempsey smallmicro cap value fund  mityx brian g rafn serves as the funds portfolio manager click here to download the statutory prospectus or obtain a hard copy by calling  the goal of the fund is to invest in only the strongest small companies the strategic approach applies a grahamdodd valuation methodology focusing on inefficiently priced smallmicrocap companies with robust fortress balance sheets and ample free cash flow companies that make it in the portfolio tend to grow organically and many are run by founderowneroperators where managements longterm interests are aligned with shareholders morgan dempsey does not rely on outside research preferring instead to do our own forensic accounting and analysis we believe that disciplined fundamental bottomup research is the key to gaining an information advantage we consult company ksqsks and conduct frequent and indepth conversations with management competitors employees regulators and suppliers it is desirable to find companies selling at a  discount to our computed valuations additionally emphasis is placed on looking for an emerging catalyst in order to avoid the inertia exhibited by many small company value stocks employing a contrarian bias affords us the freedom to be agnostic to benchmark weightings and to instead focus on what we believe are the best companies in the most promising areas of the market our ability to pursue inefficiently priced microcap companies in addition to smallcaps provides us with opportunities that are off limits to larger asset burdened strategies one major fundamental tenant that runs through our trading strategy is that we do not equate risk with price volatility worrying about shortterm price movements which are unrelated to business fundamentals tends to produce poor longterm results we invite volatility as it may allow us to add to attractive investments we understand at reasonable prices we are buyandhold investors and tend to be concentrated in our highest conviction ideas we believe in having conviction in our analysis and patience in our convictions the process targets companies with increasing intrinsic values which we believe should allow our holdings to grow and build shareholder value over extended periods of time as managers we want to be longterm partners with the great companies and exceptional management teams we have invested the time to understand our strategy we believe the small capmicro strategy offers the opportunity to pursue excess returns based on a variety of factors fortress balance sheets were looking for companies with ample free cash flow little leverage and minimal goodwill who adhere to conservative generally accepted accounting principles gaap accounting the vast majority of companies in the small and micro cap space do not meet our strict criteria we believe a strong balance sheet allows company to thrive in good times survive in bad times founderowner operators the majority of the companies the portfolio seeks to invest in are founderowneroperator run we believe to be treated like an owner we have to invest with owners long term operating histories provide a historical frame of reference avoiding trouble  strong risk controls we utilize conservative gaap accounting because we believe great companies aren’t built with creative accounting we invest in easy to understand companies  we avoid turnarounds serial rollups litigation debt and other problems information advantage  intense forensic accounting  long term familiarity we utilize an intense fundamental bottomup research process we have followed many of the companies we seek to invest in for years we believe globalized markets have created a vacuum of coverage in the smallmicrocap space concentrated in highest conviction ideas top  holdings will typically average   of portfolio weight our best researched ideas aren’t diluted over diversification leads to less knowledge of individual holdings may potentially increase investment risk benchmark agnostic we pursue our best ideas in the most promising areas of the market we are active managers not benchmark huggers we buy microcaps in addition to smallcaps we believe we are able to gain a significant information advantage due to the lack of any other analyst coverage in much of our portfolio as well as the depth and detail of our analysis we place into our proprietary research process smaller opportunities are technically offlimits to larger investment firms burdened by assets mutual fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible the fund invests in small and microcapitalization companies which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger capitalization companies unlikemutual funds etfs do not necessarily trade at the net asset values of their underlying securities which means an etf could potentially trade above or below the value of its underlying portfolio the fund’s use of derivatives could cause losses due to the unexpected effect of market movements on a derivative’s price or because the derivatives do not perform as anticipated before you
