therapeutics inc defendant civ at motion to dismiss or in the alternative motion to dismiss or stay in favor of firstfiled matter § § § § § § § § § § § steckler llp mazin a sbaiti esq new york bar no   hillcrest rd suite  dallas texas  tel   fax   email protected counsel for defendant case cvat document  filed  page  of  i introduction defendant oxysure respectfully moves this court to dismiss this case or transfer this matter to the already pending firstfiled matter seeking rescission in the eastern district of texas the reasons are simple  this court does not have personal jurisdiction over oxysure—oxysure does not have ongoing or continuous contacts with new york and so no general jurisdiction lies and new york has no relationship to this dispute between a texas company and two california lenders thus no specific jurisdiction lies  if this court determines it has personal jurisdiction it should defer to the first filed matter in the first instance to decide venue currently whether the case may properly be brought in texas or should be transferred to new york is the subject of a §  motion pending there and its decision should be respected by this court  the texas action does not seek to enforce the agreements it seeks to rescind the transaction in its entirety because it was induced by fraud andor is not the product of a meeting of the minds—thus the choice of forum clause is inapplicable  the choiceofforum provision in the agreement is unconscionable as written—it is unilateral and only applies to oxysure—thus there is no grounds on which to say that the parties have rationally consented to new york as a venue plaintiffs hang their proverbial hats on the choice of forum clause however it is insufficient on its own to confer personal jurisdiction this case arises between two california based plaintiffs and a texasbased defendant there is no nexus whatsoever to the state of new york under the longarm statute furthermore this case should be dismissed in favor of the pending texas action where plaintiffs here defendants there have raised the issue of venue in a motion to transfer the first filed rule states that the court of firstimpression has the right to determine whether to dismiss or motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  transfer the case and that the secondfiled court should dismiss its own action out of deference to that determination ii motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction oxysure moves to dismiss this matter for lack of personal jurisdiction as this court is wellaware personal jurisdiction can only be predicated on two grounds either general or specific a there are no grounds for exercising jurisdiction under the long arm statute plaintiffs have alleged no grounds for the exercise of jurisdiction this court only has jurisdiction over oxysure a foreign corporation if oxysure’s activities satisfy a prong of the new york longarm statute ny cplr §  see aquiline capital partners llc v finarch llc  f supp d   sdny  in general “new york courts have cautioned  that defendants … should be subject to suit where they are normally found that is at their preeminent headquarters or where they conduct substantial business activities only in a rare case should they be compelled to answer a suit in a jurisdiction with which they have the barest of contact” id citing mckee elec co v rauland–borg corp  nyd    nyd   nysd   ned   internal quotation marks and additional citation omitted emphasis added it is well established that “new york’s longarm statute … is narrower than the due process clause” and thus imposes independent statutory obligations for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant see nationwide mut ins co v tryg intl ins co  fd   d cir  thus where they do not meet the longarm statute cased filed in new york must nonetheless be dismissed even if it has not been shown that “maintenance of the suit motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  offends traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” under the federal constitution intl shoe co v state of wash office of unemployment comp  placement  us    internal citations omitted critically the new york longarm statute says nothing of an agreement to consent to jurisdiction in new york as being a premise for exercising jurisdiction over a foreign company who contracts with another nonnew york domiciled person or entity see ny cplr §  a mere contract signed between oxysure and defendants is insufficient to bring specific or general jurisdiction over oxysure without the statutorily enumerated contacts with new york see aquiline capital partners  f supp d at  meanwhile it is well established that “technicalities of the execution of the contract and the contractual provision that the contract was made in new york and was to be interpreted according to the law of new york cannot change the business realities of the transaction” s mach co v mohasco indus inc  fd   th cir  citing bach v friden calculating mach co  fd  th cir  footnote omitted thus new york’s longarm statute does not recognize personal jurisdiction arising from contractual relationships absent evidence that “the defendant has transacted any business within the state and that the cause of action arises from  such business transactions” see schneider v j  c carpet co  add   ny st dept  ny cplr § a accordingly this “court must decide ‘ whether the defendant transacts any business in new york and if so  whether this cause of action arises from such a business transaction’” newman v capitol life ins co  fsuppd   sdny  rakoff j quoting best van lines inc v walker  fd   d cir  additional internal quotation motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  marks and citation omitted brackets in original if the answer to either of these questions is “no” then this court does not have personal jurisdiction over oxysure id “to determine whether a party in a contract action has transacted business within the meaning of § a courts consider among other things the following factors  whether the contract was negotiated and executed in new york and whether the defendant visited new york for the purpose of meeting with the parties after the contract had been executed  whether the contract contains a new york choiceoflaw clause  whether the contract is to be performed in new york  whether the contract requires notices and payments to be sent to new york and  defendants physical presence in new york in connection with an ongoing contractual relationship with a new york corporation” arista techs inc v arthur d little enters  f supp d   edny  citations omitted here plaintiffs have alleged no jurisdictional facts at all there is no dispute that the parties’ headquarters are in california and texas the contract was not consummated in new york nor performed in new york in any fashion moreover for a company that has “no new york office no new york mailing address no new york bank accounts and no employees working in new york” whose instate contacts are “all sporadic and not carried out from a permanent location in the state or by its agents or employees in the state” there is no personal jurisdiction under new york’s longarm statute cardone v jiminy peak inc  nysd    there is thus zero relationship between this transaction and new york see arista techs  f supp d at  holding that contracts negotiated in california and performed in california would not subject defendant to new york jurisdiction  see declaration of julian ross january   see also complaint  see id motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  no court has held that signing a contract in texas or california or anywhere other than new york is sufficient to treat one as having “done business within the state” for the purposes of the new york long arm statute—in fact just the opposite is true see mayes v leipziger  fd   d cir  “so far as we are aware no court has extended s a to reach a nondomiciliary who never entered new york who was solicited outside of new york to perform services outside of new york who performed outside of new york such services as were performed and who is alleged to have neglected to perform other services outside of new york” collecting new york cases pell v clarke no cv wl  at  sdny mar   no personal jurisdiction under cplr § a where plaintiff initiated and pressed the business relationship between the parties thus there is no personal jurisdiction in new york “the mere execution of a contract in new york by a nondomiciliary …with no other contacts … is not conclusive as to personal jurisdiction” electronics devices inc v mark rogers associates  misc d    nysd   city ct  affd sub nom elec devices inc v mark rogers assoc  misc d   nysd  app term  citing bundt v embro  add    nysd   d dept  affd sub nom bundt v wallachs auto rental inc  nyd   ned   even “‘where a defendant’s contacts with new york consist of telephone calls email transmissions and correspondence in connection with the negotiation of a contract that has a center of gravity well outside the state’” the new york longarm statute is not satisfied see digital lab solutions llc v stickler no cv  wl  at  sdny mar   quoting palace exploration co v petroleum dev  fsuppd   sdny  motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  while plaintiffs are sure to refer this court to decisions holding that venueselection clauses are enforceable those have nothing to do with the issue of personal jurisdiction and the two questions should not be conflated or confused see hanson v denckla  us    “the issue is personal jurisdiction not choice of law it is resolved in this case by considering the acts of the trustee as we have indicated they are insufficient to sustain the jurisdiction” and although a choice of new york law can be a relevant factor to consider in weighing specific jurisdiction—a venue or choice of law clause “…standing alone ‘does not constitute a voluntary submission to personal jurisdiction’” cutco indus inc v naughton  fd   d cir  accord aquiline capital partners llc  f supp d at  further weakening plaintiffs’ argument is the permissive nature of the language allowing the “holder” to “waive” the choice of venue and to file anywhere it chose renders the clause permissive and could not likewise be construed as a blanket submission of oxysure to personal jurisdiction no matter where that case was elected to be filed accord powerdsine inc v broadcom corp  us dist lexis   edny jan   holding that permissive venue selection clause was insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction because defendant did not agree to “submit to the jurisdiction of any court” thus the choice of venue clause as the only “contact” is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over oxysure b exercising personal jurisdiction over oxysure would be unconstitutional while the new york longarm statute is not coextensive with the due process clause exercising personal jurisdiction here would indeed violate the us constitution due process dictates that personal jurisdiction exists only where there is either general or specific jurisdiction motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  over oxysure due to the acts of oxysure in the forum state see hanson  us at  at minimum due process requires both that “the defendant on his own initiative … project himself into” new york and that the plaintiff identify a substantial nexus between this voluntary projection and its cause of action parkebernet galleries inc v franklyn  nyd    see also paterno v laser spine inst  nyd    “defendant must on his or her own initiative  project himself or herself’ into this state to engage in a ‘sustained and substantial transaction of business” quoting fischbarg v doucet  nyd    first bracket added remaining brackets in original it has long been held that “some single or occasional acts” related to the forum may not be sufficient to establish jurisdiction if “their nature and quality and the circumstances of their commission” create only an “attenuated” affiliation with the forum see international shoe co v washington  us    one such attenuated affiliation with the forum is the choice of lawforum selection clause courts—include the united states supreme court—have stated that a forum selection clause standing alone is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction without other substantive contacts to wit in burger king corp v rudzewicz  us   the supreme court held the forumselection clause “standing alone would be insufficient to confer jurisdiction” without the other substantive acts that “reinforced his deliberate affiliation with the forum state and the reasonable foreseeability of possible litigation there” id at  cutco indus  fd   citing burger king held that butfor postcontract performance of contract in new york no personal jurisdiction would have lay simply from choice of venueforum clause thus constitutionally speaking a forumselection clause is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction yet here that is all that is alleged none of the parties the transaction the motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  performance or the breaches occurred in new york therefore because a choice of venue clause is not enough any decision requiring oxysure to appear in new york would be a violation of due process and therefore an invalid and unconstitutional exercise of jurisdiction over oxysure c the forum selection clause is unenforceable dismissal is also proper because the only contact is the forum selection clause and that clause is unenforceable the complaint itself alleged that the forumselection clause reads as follows any action brought concerning the transactions contemplated by this warrant shall be brought only in the state of courts of new york or in the federal courts located in the state of new york provided however that the holder may choose to waive this provision and bring an action outside the state of new york the last clause renders the entire clause permissive and unenforceable first it has long been held that where one party is permitted to select any court it chooses and there has been no submission to a particular jurisdiction then the entire clause is rendered permissive and the nonfiling party is not bound thereby see eg congress fin corp v bortnick no  civ   us dist lexis   wl  at  sdny oct   declining to enforce forum selection clause that did not specify that plaintiff could force defendants to submit to its choice of forum powerdsine inc  us dist lexis   holding that lack of submission by the defendant to any jurisdiction selected by plaintiff rendered clause unenforceable the fact that the clause here is augmented by a waiver of otherwise mandatory language cannot change the analysis see id compare agr fin llc  see complaint ¶  motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  v ready staffing inc  fsuppd   sdny  holding that express provision that defendant agreed to submit to the forum and jurisdiction of any forum selected by plaintiff did not render provision unenforceable read as a whole as it must the clause does not bind oxysure second the fact that clause unilaterally allows one party to waive and change the forum without notice renders it facially illusory and substantively unfair and thus unenforceable see in re zapposcom inc customer data sec breach litig  f supp d   d nev  ability to unilaterally waive provision renders promise to arbitrate illusory and thus unenforceable grosvenor v qwest corp  f supp d   d colo  same see wagman v chater no  civ  dc  us dist lexis  at  sdny may   noting that under new york law an agreement that is illusory is not enforceable while some cases have held that a notice requirement may save a unilateral provision from this fate see eg bassett v elec arts inc  f supp d   edny  this particular provision contains no notice requirement therefore the forumselection clause is at best dubiously enforceable the fact that it allows the plaintiffs to waive venue means that oxysure has not agreed to have new york govern its contract litigation and thus there is no reason why new york would have jurisdiction over this case just because of the choice of venue clause d without jurisdiction this court must dismiss this suit absent a showing that this court has personal jurisdiction over oxysure under the new york longarm statute this court is obligated to dismiss this suit under federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  iii alternate motion to dismiss or stay in favor of firstfiled case a this court should yield to the firstfiled case’s determination of venue plaintiffs in this case are defendants in the texasfiled action the texas filed action was filed on december   while this action was filed a week later indeed plaintiffs in this action have already raised the issue of venue before the texas court and that matter will briefed before this court’s decision thereon that the firstfiled case should govern the proceedings is an uncontroversial proposition in this circuit donaldson lufkin  jenrette inc v los angeles county  f supp   sdny  “the accepted rule in this circuit is that the forum where an action is filed first is accorded priority over subsequent actions arising out of the facts giving rise to the first filed action” the firstfiled rule “requires the second filed new york action to be dismissed in favor of the firstfiled action” j lyons  co v republic of tea  f supp   sdny  courts in this circuit hold that the second filed case should be dismissed while the first filed court entertains motions about whether to dismiss or transfer the firstfiled suit see donaldson  f supp at  dismissing secondfiled action without prejudice because court of firstfiling should determine whether to dismiss or transfer firstfiled action see also meeropol v nizer  fd   d cir  “where an action is brought in one federal docket nos   see oxysure systems inc v gemini capital llc et al cause no cv eastern district of texas  see oxysure systems inc v gemini capital llc et al cause no cv eastern district of texas docket nos   see oxysure systems inc v gemini capital llc et al cause no cv eastern district of texas docket no  motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  district court and a later action embracing the same issue is brought in another federal court the first court has jurisdiction to enjoin the prosecution of the second action” citations omitted the rationale is one of comity and judicial efficiency see id while the firstfiled rule can be mitigated by showing that the firstfiled case is merely a sham meant to secure venue in another jurisdiction the allegations in the texas case show that that is plainly not the case here thus while the action in texas is proceeding this court should dismiss this case awaiting the texas decision on venue b the texas action is logically and legally antecedent to the new york action and should thus be allowed to proceed first the texas claims seek rescission of the contract due to fraud in the inducement and lack of a meeting of the minds and and a declaration of its unenforceability—and thus do not depend on the construction or enforcement of the contract if the texas action goes forward successfully for oxysure then it will render the entirety of these proceedings moot because there will be no contract to enforce furthermore there is little chance that the texas claims fall under the forum selection clause invoked here and there because they are antecedent to the contract issues the action in texas seeks rescission of the transactions and the agreements and seeks to declare the unenforceability on various grounds thus as several courts have held such actions are not subject to the choice of forum clause see altvater gesslerja baczewski intl usa inc v sobieski destylarnia sa  fd   d cir  holding that tortious claims that predate contract formation do not invoke the contract’s choice of forum or venue clauses phillips v audio active ltd  fd   d cir  where causes of action do not “depend on the construction of an agreement” then they do not fall under a forumselection motion to dismiss or in the alternative stay page  case cvat document  filed  page  of  clause see phillips  fd at  holding that unlike arbitration clauses forum selection clauses must be construed literally not expansively because “the absence of a congressional policy on forum clauses prompting us to err on the side of coverage is significant” citing and distinguishing in part omron healthcare inc v maclaren exps ltd  fd   th cir  c this court should dismiss this action in favor of the texas action or stay this action pending resolution of the texas action given the foregoing this court should dismiss the action before it in favor of the texas action donaldson  f supp at  in the event that the texas court keeps the case then this court will not have wasted its time on duplicative efforts if the texas transfers the case to the southern district of new york then that case will proceed here and the claims in this case would presumably be brought as counterclaims alternatively this court could simply stay this case pending the outcome of the texas action be it dismissal
