payroll to talent management to benefits administration adp brings unmatched depth and expertise in helping clients build a better workforce  a pioneer in human capital management hcm and business process outsourcing adp serves more than 65 clients in more than  countries  adpcom narrative essayas the head of adp’s global product  technology gpt organization i occupy a fairly uncommon dual role overseeing both our gotomarket products as well as our internal information structure this began with my predecessor who saw that there was tremendous synergy in combining the traditional chief product officer and chief information officer roles the gpt approach is more holistic focused on products and rd in addition to infrastructure and it’s an exciting place to be right now why because the first  years of adp were largely defined by service – adp associates solved problems and performed routine tasks for our clients – but the next  years will be defined by what we’re able to do with technology subhead building stem talent for tomorrow’s workforce establishing a technology culture and building the right talent to help drive the vision is hugely important with the pace of change in technology we are moving rapidly to become a more technologyled company  our clients expect their enterprise technology to behave more like consumer technology –easy to use predictive ubiquitous personalized – and we need to deliver in order to ensure our market success our push on innovation has our organization growing near the same rate as adp’s overall revenue and we will continue this focus on building talent and technology leadership to drive product breakthroughs and reinforce the culture that we’re developing  we’re designing our nextgeneration products on a platform leveraging stateoftheart technologies and we’re looking for people with strong technical training who are selfstarters and problem solvers and prepared to help us accelerate our pace of innovation we’re also upskilling our staff through training and hiring implementing “agile” software development redesigning our workplaces across geographies and evaluating recruiting practices and rewards to allow us to build a team that will reinforce the technology culture and deliver business results  stem graduates are crucial to all of this subhead technology business and stem we will push on a number of technologies going forward with two of special interest to the stem community first “big data” this term means a lot of things to a lot of people but at adp the meaning is very clear leveraging our enormous dataset 6 million anonymized and aggregated employee records to provide insights and solutions to our clients this means building bigdata capabilities into our solutions so that analytics aren’t a separate activity for instance as a human resources executive is initiating a decision process bigdata analytics can help spotlight the information he or she may need in real time to help make a better decision maybe something as simple as in a hiring process the analytics kick in to let the executive know “here are the most successful skill sets for that position” or “your trend lines suggest that you may want to hire multiple people for that position” and this is all running in the background for stem students this calls for a combination of art and science we’re recruiting for data scientists people who have the training and aptitude to recognize the patterns in data that enable those insights this is not simple math it requires a computer science background plus statistics and visualization skills which is where the art comes in the second main area of interest is in apps just like you download useful apps onto your smartphone businesspeople are expecting the same experience with the systems they use at work adp like many companies has begun providing this capability – specifically a “marketplace” where our clients can access specific business apps developed by both us and our partners let’s say we or one of our partners invents a new way to do performance reviews an hr executive should be able to easily download that new capability from our marketplace and add it to the company’s toolset and use it within its existing human capital management system congratulations to stem students who are already building and publishing apps – this activity has introduced you to what it means to create something that’s operational and easy for people to download use and gain value from in today’s world creating apps is a great way to get started and get exposed to the experience of running a business  you have to think about your target market creating a positive user experience how you provide updates and upgrades how you communicate the value of the app and ensure that the app is useful – otherwise no one will download it that’s exactly what we’re trying to do build things that are useful and that people want to use and that’s why adp is proud to be associated with the stemconnector program we’re very excited to meet the next generation of stem achievers stuart sackman 5  stemconnector type and press “enter” to search x
