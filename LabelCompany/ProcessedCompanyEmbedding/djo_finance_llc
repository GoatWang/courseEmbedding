of  third lien notes collectively the “notes” represent significant components of our capital structure under our senior secured credit facilities we are required to maintain a specified senior secured first lien leverage ratio which is determined based on our adjusted ebitda if we fail to comply with the senior secured first lien leverage ratio under our senior secured credit facilities we would be in default upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities

principal premium if any and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable in addition under the indentures governing the notes our and our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness making investments refinancing subordinated indebtedness paying dividends and entering into certain merger transactions is governed in part by our ability to satisfy tests based on adjusted ebitda our ability to meet the covenants specified in the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing those notes will depend on future
