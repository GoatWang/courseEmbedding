 edt last modified on wednesday  july   edt the former conservative cabinet minister steve norris has agreed to pay £ in costs and issue a public apology to millwall’s owner john berylson over a comment made by norris on twitter the legal settlement is the latest twist in the millwall compulsory purchase saga that saw lewisham council attempt to seize land occupied by the club’s community trust in order to sell it to a small offshoreregistered developer called renewal norris best known for his role in privatising the railways in john major’s government is chairman of the surrey canal sports foundation a charitable company set up to offer an element of public benefit in the controversial housing scheme millwall and the battle over the den how the controversy has unfolded read more following a series of troublesome revelations around the scheme several of norris’s fellow trustees resigned from his foundation including the mayor of lewisham sir steve bullock the leader of southwark council peter john and dame tanni greythompson the compulsory purchase of the land was halted in january this year and a public inquiry into the scheme announced led by the former master of the rolls lord dyson in march shortly after the inquiry had been announced norris took to twitter to engage in a series of animated conversations with opponents of the scheme including millwall fans and local residents in the course of this the twicefailed london mayoral candidate accused berylson of intending to “blackmail” renewal in some unspecified sense an accusation apparently offered without foundation or awareness of its seriousness berylson whose family business is based in the united states took legal action to protect his reputation with the case heading towards a hearing norris has accepted that his comment could have been interpreted as suggesting berylson was engaging in blackmail that such an accusation would be completely false and offered a public apology norris has also agreed to pay the legal costs of the proceedings in a statement berylson said “i welcome the fact that this legal dispute has now been resolved and that the chairman of the surrey canal sports foundation scsf steve norris has acknowledged that his defamatory comment made on twitter was wholly unwarranted he has now publicly apologised to me “while i have never sought any financial gain from this case i do care greatly that my reputation as a businessman remains firmly intact it is the foundation on which i have built my career over many years and i will not have that tarnished under any circumstances mr norris has paid £ to cover my legal costs which were unnecessarily incurred as a consequence of his potentially damaging and entirely inaccurate tweet” in court norris offered the following statement “on  march  as part of a twitter exchange i said that imho mr berylson thinks he can blackmail renewal i apologise to mr berylson if those reading my tweet interpreted my comments as meaning that mr berylson was engaging in blackmail such an allegation would be untrue and defamatory i accept that mr berylson has always acted in the best interests of millwall football club i apologise to mr berylson and i apologise if it has caused him any harm” the settlement represents an embarrassing note in the career of norris  who works as a public relations specialist for the london communications agency the stated aims of london communications are to “audit reputations” “handle crises” and “manage media relations” in this case norris would appear to have done exactly the opposite providing instead a textbook example of the perils of social media in the hands of the naive or inexperienced this year katie hopkins was found to have defamed the food blogger jack monroe after mistakenly accusing monroe of supporting the vandalising of second world war statues norris will join hopkins who is appealing on the list of those who have fallen foul of instant publication of potentially actionable statements under the settlement norris also agreed to tweet the apology from his account on wednesday afternoon and to leave the apology tweet undeleted for posterity responding to the news the association of millwall supporters said “we are delighted mr norris has apologised for his strange and unfounded accusations we hope mr norris can learn from his mistake and now appreciates that social media can be a powerful tool in the wrong hands while we accept mr norris has simply been naive in this case we trust and hope he will treat fellow twitter users with due courtesy in future” the case will also cause a further note of peripheral embarrassment for lewisham council as it provides evidence to the dyson inquiry into its dealings regarding the millwall land seizure and the new bermondsey regeneration project norris was a fellow board member at the scsf of bullock the labour mayor norris’s remaining fellow directors include jordana malik the
