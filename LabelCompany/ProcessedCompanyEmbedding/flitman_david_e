international events student arts puzzles jobs  qa david flitman flagstone rewhat events led to you following an actuarial careeri had heard about the actuarial field from my calculus teacher and liked the concept of a fusion of maths and business to be honest i wasn’t much of a student but i was good at maths i come from a professional family mostly of physicians  my mother father brothers sisters cousins  so maybe becoming an actuary was my form of rebellion i went to the state university of new york albany then switched to the college of insurance which is now part of st john’s university i had a bit of a misspent youth there taking a lot of exams for a life designation before i figured out that property casualty was much more interesting in the us you have to choose between life and property and casualty in the us there were a lot of actuaries in casualty whereas in lloyd’s there were not as many nonlife actuaries my first job was with iso a us rating bureau it was a great place to start as we were using large data sets and i got to see a lot of different lines of business i then moved to wr berkley insurance in the casualty field what has been your greatest professional challenge to datethe biggest challenge has been my new role flagstone is a global company and i have to coordinate a global team you need to make sure that you are using your resources correctly and connecting with your team my team consists of one third actuaries one third catastrophe modellers and one third claims people you also have to make sure that people are engaged and learning while they are working in  you completed the first fiveperil paradex deal you were quoted as stating the paradex trigger reduces investors’ exposure to nonmodelled risks and the quick settlement guaranteed by paradex allows us to shorten the potential extension period to  days what was the essence of the deal and would you elaborate on your quotethe deal had three tranches two were ‘per occurrence’ covering us wind and earthquake the second had a little grand cayman exposure and the third was an aggregate five peril including us wind and earthquake european wind japanese wind and japanese earthquake paradex checks boxes by being a fairly transparent index where the investor knows prior to event occurrences how much potential exposure to catastrophic events such as wind or ground moves this is as opposed to the vagaries of indemnity settlements where the claims adjustment can become politicised by ambitious politicians or distorted by an activist bar or liberal courts you spent a number of years working in north america before taking your career offshore into bermuda how did that come abouti had a couple of different positions firstly in primary insurance with wr berkley and then in reinsurance at xl i then moved to ace tempest and was asked to come to bermuda as chief actuary that was in  i then saw a dynamic opportunity at flagstone working hard and being good at your job are important in a career but making the right move at the right time is key i moved to flagstone a startup formed in the wake of a lack of reinsurance capacity following hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in  just as the market was turning it was a great opportunity  serendipity is important in life how does working in bermuda compare with working in the usthe pace is very similar in bermuda to the us but has a really international feel to it i work with a combination of bermudians canadians british and of course people from the us it may not sound very international to you but compared to working in new york where diversity is new jersey vs long islander it feels very international bermuda is a fusion of caribbean american british and canadian influences in terms of work we have a more international book of business  my knowledge of geography has certainly got a lot stronger since working here how do you measure your successwhat i personally look for is to stay engaged this involves learning new things and exploring different areas the job i do now certainly ticks all the boxes some of the new things i’ve had to learn to do in bermuda have allowed me to do this  being exposed to international markets going to lloyd’s of london and meeting different cedants working on business in japan and australia i’ve been working in aviation marine and energy and satellite which are traditionally lines that are very common to lloyd’s of london and i have loved all of that i like to work hard and if you are going to work as hard as we do you need to love what you are doing what is your top tip for a fruitful careeryou have to be interested and stay interested to work in this industry it is not just a processing task until you leave at pm if we treat it like a process  for instance ten steps in order to get an answer  then we lose out on a great deal some people are very capable and go through all the steps but don’t think abstractly if all one is interested in is getting to the answer then a more precise field like accounting will be more gratifying in our job we have to make assumptions so we have to rely upon our judgment we are the sum of our experiences and it is building upon this knowledge base that makes us good at what we do another thing is to be open to new roles and experiences when i moved to bermuda i was recently married and it could have been quite challenging but we found out it worked out well doing the safe job and doing what is in front of you is easier i know it sounds corny but taking the proverbial path less well travelled has made all the difference what do you believe are the opportunities for actuaries in the risk management fieldactuaries have a unique skillset social sciences economics and many other fields have large error probabilities and you can’t set up a controlled environment in a lab that is where we come in  you have to use experience and judgment for underwriting satellite risk say there is a very small set of data and you have to make assumptions you can mitigate the risk by making demands on product design but in the end you have to draw on your experience and sometimes you have to guess i can’t go and tell an underwriter  plus or minus  when he wants to know if he can sell it at  there is a scientific aspect to being an actuary but judgment is important it is a softer concept bridging the gap between the cold realities of science and having to make a business decision no matter how precise the model there will be problems with it think of the riots in egypt or someone flying a plane into the world trade centre these kinds of things cannot be factored in to any model so you have to think about what else could happen keep a bag of tricks so to speak when assessing the risk structured financial products are a case in point our onein or oneinyear events are all based on an assumption that our view of risk is correct but what about global contagion what if the mouse eats the wrong piece of cheese the financial crisis was not factored into those models as actuaries we have to look at other factors look at more than statistical performance because we know we never have everything in front of us we have to have our eyes wide open for the things that are missing from the modelwhat three issues should insurers have in mind for  and beyondthe soft market is significant the challenge is to work out how much a product costs and work with what is being charged for it there is a problem in thinking we can continue this way working with constantly falling prices how much longer can prices go down in years gone by the market has relied on investment income but with the global financial crisis of  companies’ investment rates are lower and spreads are compressing the economy is still not that healthy and already we are seeing people taking more investment risk on that side of the balance sheet another issue is the ‘known unknowns’ such as energy risk and catastrophic risk we have to evaluate the weather we have seen  the activity in australia brazil pakistan and russia and try to see what is happening with natural catastrophes then there are the changes in our world with the bric brazil russia india china or nonorganisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries growing and possible political instability what is the most interesting placecountry to which you’ve travelled and whyi thought about this and i was thinking about all the new places i have seen  japan australia and so on  but actually it is lloyd’s of london and i love being in london i find the whole dynamic of this market that is hundreds of years old and the phenomenon of walking the floor with a slip and seeing the underwriters and all the smaller syndicates that make up the huge entity that is lloyd’s and i like to see the contrast to bermuda where people fly down and walk up and down front street the main waterside street in bermuda’s capital hamilton to see the underwriter and to see how differently the two markets have evolved what do you do to relaxi have three girls under five  a fiveyearold a threeyearold and a sixmonthold and they take up most of my free time thankfully they are all good sleepers  they take after their dad in that way other than that i like to read both fiction and nonfiction i love the classics and read quite a bit of nonfiction i like malcolm gladwell and i find biographies interesting i also like swimming both in the sea in bermuda and in pools i travel quite a bit and always try to swim when i am travelling i also like beer and i’ve tried nearly  types of beer so far but at the moment i’m trying to stick to a lowcarb diet so i am learning a bit more about wine david flitman joined flagstone as
