important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of managements judgment our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us

apparent from other sources actual results may differ significantly from those estimates while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note  to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements longlived assets the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable the company evaluates assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and fair value  table of contents fair value measurement the companys financial instruments are cash accounts receivable accounts payable accrued
