you to check in for your flight from anywhere there’s an internet connection in most cases you can select your seats and check in from  hours up until  hours before your flight and if your itinerary includes a connection to a carrier that the airline has an eticketing and online checkin agreement with you may check in for your flights with those carriers as well the majority of sizeable domestic airlines offer web checkin including delta united us airways american northwest continental alaska  jet blue and southwest some major international airlines also feature web checkin including air

drawbacks it’s a good idea to be aware of both the pros and the cons before you take the web checkin plunge have a tip to shareemail us at helloegenciacom what’s so great about it one of the best things about web checkin is that you can arrive at the airport much closer to takeoff you just need to be at the gate by the time the door is closed  to  minutes before departure typically those who are last to check in at the airport are the first to get bumped if the flight is overbooked however with online checkin you can lose your keys forget your wallet drive back home to retrieve it get stuck in traffic arrive at the airport just in the nick of time and your seat still won’t be given away even if you dont make it at all  your seat will be held until the last possible moment only if you havent showed up at that point and the spare seats are needed will the airline give away your seat  okay so what’s not so great while some people have concerns about how or when theyre going to check their luggage in and are worried about its integration into the system when they checkin online that really is a nonissue the biggest restriction is that once you check in you cannot make any changes to your reservation so if your plans could change online checkin is not a good fit for your travel plans once you checkin an airline imposed change fee will be applied youll also need to call
