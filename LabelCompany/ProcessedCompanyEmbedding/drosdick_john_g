university alumni association  address sunoco  penn center  market street philadelphia pennsylvania  httpwwwsunocoinccom ■ at tosco and ultramar john g drosdick built a reputation for reforming corporate culture as well as for cutting costs at sunoco he demonstrated an ability to rebuild a company his employees responded well to his straightforward directions and he had a knack for making his goals plain to his managers although he made tough decisions as a leader drosdick had a sense of humor and a relaxed manner that translated not only into his flashy suits but into a cheerful corporate atmosphere building a career drosdick earned a bachelors degree from villanova university in  and a masters degree from the university of massachusetts at amherst in  both in chemical engineering in  he was hired by exxon usa and moved to houston texas in  he moved to baton rouge to manage exxons department of facilities development and in  he became manager of exxons refinery

in long beach california drosdick took over the operations of another petroleum company in decline there he cut costs and set up a merger with diamond shamrock creating ultramar diamond shamrock corporation the merger occurred soon after he left to join sun company another petroleum company that had endured tough times in the s restructuring sun company into sunoco in november  drosdick became the first person from outside sun company to be named president corporate headquarters lay in philadelphia pennsylvania and he moved to bryn mawr the ceo robert h campbell had already begun restructuring sun company through the selling of its international operations and as president drosdick oversaw the final stages of reorganization his daytoday presence was quickly felt among coworkers in philadelphia where he created a notably upbeat atmosphere he remarked in the philadelphia business journal  i dont think you can be too clear with people may   as he made sure his managers knew exactly what was expected of them in  sun companys net income rose  million and drosdick was paid  in salary he was promised bonuses of up  percent of his base salary if the company continued to improve on november   sun company became sunoco a name intended to signify happier times at the company but  proved to be a very tough year gasoline prices went into a slump and drosdick was forced to oversee layoffs of refinery employees still he earned a  bonus on top of his years salary of  making sunoco a star on may   while remaining president drosdick became ceo and chairman of the board at sunoco replacing campbell his vision was to make the company resistant to the upanddown cycles of the petroleum industry in  sunocos biggest move was the acquisition of one hundred gas stations owned by coastal mart in the eastern united states the stations and their convenience stores were renamed sunoco and aplus that year sunoco netted  million in january  sunoco purchased aristech chemical corporation of pittsburgh pennsylvania from mitsubishi corporation for  million the purchase included a research center and five chemical plants with totals of  employees and gave sunoco the capacity to produce nine billion pounds of petrochemicals further the deal was expected to give sunoco economic balance as drosdick explained because chemicalsales cycles tended to oppose gasolinesales cycles chemical sales would cushion sunoco during periods of poor gasoline sales unfortunately for the first nine months of  sunocos chemical business lost  million— million by aristech—on sales of  billion still drosdick had bought aristech from the cashstrapped mitsubishi for only half of its worth and the purchase was intended to be a longterm investment in  sunoco dropped its kendall lubricant line and shut down its yabucoa puerto rico refinery and three related lubricant plants in california oklahoma and pennsylvania drosdick searched for buyers for the facilities without success at the end of  sunoco possessed  gasstation and conveniencestore outlets and  terminals for petroleumproducts storage the company netted  million for the year in june  sunoco purchased  gas stations and convenience stores in florida georgia south carolina and north carolina from speedway superamerica—a subsidiary of marathon ashland petroleum—for  million by the end of the year sunoco owned over  retail sites and the convenience stores were helping keep the bottom line steady the company bought the eagle point refinery from el paso for  million—the price was considered low because few companies were interested in buying the plant sunocos refining capacity grew to  barrels per day it began the year as americas ninthlargest petroleum company and finished as the eighth–largest during this period as sunoco had come under fire from environmentalists as well as congress for polluting the air at its manufacturing plants the company undertook the installation of new pollutantcapture technology at its facilities the most dramatic environmental effort came in  when sunoco built a new manufacturing plant for the solid fuel coke used in making highgrade metals in haverill ohio for  million the plant included a special heatrecovery system that would produce steam to be piped to a sunoco chemical plant thus reducing pollution as well as recycling recovered
