hambrecht  co we help companies of all sizes efficiently access capital at the lowest possible cost in order to accelerate disruptive growth wr hambrecht  co was founded in january  to level the playing field for investors and our corporate clients our founder bill hambrecht is a silicon valley pioneer who has been financing growth companies from apple to google during his time at hambrecht  quist and wrhco the firm’s impartial auctions have dramatically changed the traditional investment banking landscape by allowing the market itself to determine pricing and allocations throughout our history wrhco has been an innovative leader with a core philosophy based on three tenets identifying exceptional companies helping them raise capital and go public early delivering efficient market pricing our current innovation initiatives include applying data science and disruption theory analytics to better understand companies and industries at all stages wr hambrecht  co is headquartered in san francisco with offices in new york capital raising our investment banking business aims to serve uncommon companies with compelling growth opportunities including those that traditional investment banks deem “too small” to go public it has long been our conviction that access to public capital enables growth companies to focus on innovation while providing an opportunity for all classes of investors to participate in their success to accomplish this we have created products like the openipo® auction influenced regulation change and worked toward the creation of an open ipo marketplace the openipo® auction for example levels the playing field in initial public offerings allowing individuals and institutional investors to bid online for shares of an ipo all investors end up paying the same price — a price determined by the auction under new provisions of the  jobs act we have been a pioneer and advocate for the distribution of independent preipo research to all investors further bill and our firm were cited  times in the sec’s proposed rulemaking for regulation a we believe this proposed expansion of the regulation a exemption would create a new option for earlystage growth companies to access public markets through the a ipo we leverage the internet for efficient marketing and allocation of product as opposed to the expensive sales and marketing infrastructure of the traditional investment bank based on our decades of experience taking companies public we envision an accessible marketplace for initial public offerings where the investment bank serves as a facilitator between issuers and investors instead of a gatekeeper the market itself can and should determine pricing and allocation — our role is to provide a platform where qualified growth companies can tell their story to potential investors our products the openipo® auction a simpler way to efficient and transparent ipo price discoveryavailable technology enables the distribution of issuer disclosure and research to any investor and the collection of bids in a fair and systematic fashion to learn more click here the a ipo proposed regulation a tier  changes would provide growth companies streamlined access to public capital enabling them to focus on innovation while providing an opportunity for all classes of investors to participate in their success we intend to be at the forefront of the a ipo marketplace as it evolves to learn more click here the openbook® auction an online system that offers transparent realtime price discovery for corporate bonds the openfollowon® auction extends the transparency and realtime price discovery of the openbook auction to followon equity offerings allowing interactive bidding and gives investors a view into the book as it builds venture capital and applied disruption theory disruption theory as articulated by harvard business school professor clayton christensen in his landmark work the innovator’s dilemma  is at the core of our firm’s strategy in addition to traditional fundamental analysis we use predictive data science tools to better understand companies and industries through the lens of disruption theory these tools were developed out of a breakthrough research collaboration in  between thomas thurston then at intel capital and professor christensen this innovative unique approach to venture capital investing enables us to identify the truly disruptive companies with greater probability of long term business viability our algorithmic approach stands out in an industry where subjective decisionmaking remains the status quo an open conversation wr hambrecht  co continues to identify markets where auctions will benefit investors and issuers we provide underwriting and advisory services for technology and emerging growth companies we are passionate about businesses and value the opportunity to talk to entrepreneurs if you are interested in learning more about the proposed
