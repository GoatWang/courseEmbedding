release announcing its fiscal  third quarter financial results for the companys reasons for including nongaap financial measures in its earnings announcement the reconciliation of nongaap financial

the quarter then marty will discuss the financial results in more detail including the companys updated guidance followed by arthurs concluding remarks we will then open the call for questions with that said i will now turn the call over to arthur bedrosian arthur arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc before i begin id like to acknowledge the passing of william farber the former chairman and ceo of lannett bill was a pharmacist by training and a successful entrepreneur he served as lannetts ceo for  years from  to  and as its chairman for  years from  to  bill took over a struggling lannett and led the effort to turn the company around he was truly a pioneer in our industry and a mentor and friend to me personally bill had a way with words my most memorable quote of his was lets compromise and do it my way and that ladies and gentlemen says it all on a more positive note in february we announced the addition of kristin arnold as our head of research and development kristin strengthens our senior management team and brings scientific and financial rd expertise as well as excellent experience in product development regulatory submissions project management and formulations kristin has embarked upon a reorganization of the rd department of philadelphia carmel and seymour we are pleased to welcome kristin to lannett turning to our financial performance during the fiscal  third quarter we picked up some new accounts which helped our net sales grow to approximately  million from  million in the prioryear third quarter the sales increase was largely due to volume increases we achieved this topline growth despite medicaids inflationadjusted rebate program which reduced net sales in the quarter by approximately  million the program began being applied to generic drugs for the first time in calendar  in addition net sales were lower than our expectation due to competitive pricing pressure across a number of products product mix and changes within distribution channels it is worth noting as some of you already know that we predicted the pricing headwind currently facing our industry over the last several years we took steps to mitigate the effects of these headwinds ill discuss those efforts in more detail later in this call in january and then again in march we made two voluntary payments against our outstanding revolving credit facility the combined payment of  million will save us approximately  million in annualized cash interest expense as we have stated before our goal is to continue to reduce our debt levels with that brief overview ill turn the call over to marty to discuss our financial results in more detail marty martin p galvan  lannett co inc thank you arthur and good afternoon everyone as was mentioned earlier i will be referring to nongaap financial measures the reconciliation of the gaap to nongaap numbers can be found in todays press release our earnings release also includes a schedule of our net sales by medical indication i also want to remind everyone that during the third quarter of last year we recorded a pretax onetime settlement agreement with one of our customers for approximately  million in the current year third quarter we recorded a  million adjustment to this settlement agreement as a result our gaap total net sales were  million compared with  million for the prioryear third quarter due to the nonrecurring nature of this item we excluded it from our adjusted results as it does not affect our sales run rate now for the financial results on a nongaap adjusted basis for the fiscal  third quarter net sales increased to  million from  million in last years third quarter gross profit was  million or  of net sales compared with  million or  of net sales as arthur mentioned our gross margin was impacted by competitive pricing pressure across a number of products product mix and changes within the distribution channels rd expenses decreased to  million from  million in the prioryear third quarter the decrease was due to synergies and the timing of project spend sga expenses were  million compared with  million operating income was  million compared with  million for the prioryear third quarter interest expense decreased to  million from  million the decrease is a result of our efforts to reduce debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we refinanced all of our  senior notes which totaled  million with incremental  million term loan b and retired remaining balance of the notes with cash and as arthur mentioned we made payments totaling  million to pay down our fullydrawn revolving credit facility in january and march of this year net income attributable to lannett increased to  million or  per diluted share compared with  million or  per diluted share for the fiscal  third quarter turning now to our balance sheet as arthur mentioned we paid down approximately  million of debt during the quarter accordingly at march   cash cash equivalents and investment securities totaled  million debt outstanding was  million and we continued to be well within our required debt covenant ratio with regard to our guidance we expect the factors that unfavorably impacted our third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter resulting in slightly lower q sales we expect our fiscal  fourth quarter profitability on an adjusted basis to be somewhere with our fiscal  third quarter with that i will now turn the call back over to arthur arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc thanks marty regarding the integration with ku we continue to make excellent progress consolidating our manufacturing sales research and development and distribution functions all packaging activities in philadelphia have now been transferred to our seymour indiana plant with respect to manufacturing six of our highvolume products have been transferred from philadelphia and are now being produced at the seymour plant transfer activities are ongoing for an additional six products four of which are in advanced stages of being moved in the current quarter we anticipate that by calendar yearend approximately  of the production previously performed in philadelphia will be moved to our indiana plant with regard to our pipeline we currently have pending at the fda  andas including  with a paragraph iv certification with one of our paragraph iv products zomig we are in the process of preparing our appeal which we expect to file later this month we are optimistic that we will receive several additional fda approvals before the end of our current fiscal year in addition to our own filings we have another  applications at the fda through our alliance partners were on track to file our new drug application for ctopical over the summer we anticipate an approval could come within one year following the pdufa submission of our application with an approval we will be able to market the product more aggressively with fdaapproved claims a brief update on our strategic alliance with hec i recently returned from a trip to china to meet with hecs leadership team our relationship continues to get stronger and we are now making excellent progress on a number of fronts including the distribution of up to  of our products in china by hec we have already submitted two quotations in addition our joint effort to develop generic insulin is advancing weve received fda comments to our preinvestigational new drug application for the product and we are working together to develop the best plan for filing the application as i mentioned earlier we anticipated the current competitive pricing pressure in our industry and took steps to prepare for and grow our business under these conditions these steps included among others the addition of ctopical our first branded drug product using our patented technology which allows us to expand our offering with a proprietary product and the forming and developing of our multidimensional strategic business alliance with hec our efforts also included the acquisitions of kremers urban and silarx which not only added a wide array of new capabilities but also diversified our offerings with added products and the planned expansion of cody labs which will allow us to more efficiently grow our pain management business both apis and finished dosages as you have just heard we have been working to grow our generic drug business and expanded the branded drug business we are confident that we will execute on our strategic plan and our investments and efforts will pay dividends before we open the call to questions id like to mention that lannett has been recognized as a cio  award winner for  i would like to congratulate our information technology team for winning this prestigious award and thank them for their efforts with that overview we would now like to address any questions you may have ashley questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and from bmo capital markets we have gary nachman gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states hi good afternoon guys could you give more specifics on what fiscal q will look like in terms of sales and gross margin not just profitability and how much of the pressure can you offset with cost reductions and then i have a couple of followups arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well as marty said were looking at the fourth quarter being similar to our third quarter maybe slightly weaker as you know theres a lot of pressure on pricing right now so as far as we can tell we think itll probably be somewhat similar to the third quarter but theres no way to predict that right now so id rather be conservative and not make a prediction but our feeling is itll be very similar to the third quarter gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states okay maybe just a little bit more on the gross margin so  was obviously a lot lower than we expected so is it going to stay at that level could it come down a little bit more and then just sort of comment on your expectation for that maybe going into next year given all the pricing pressure and delays to the pipeline martin p galvan  lannett co inc yes gary ill take that one our expectation is that the fourth quarter gross margin could tick up a bit from the third quarter in addition to the pricing pressures and other environmental topics we discussed we did have some manufacturing variances of a oneoff nature and we do not expect those to repeat so we expect that youll see some limited uptick in gross margin but the factor is the holistic or macro factors that we spoke about those we do expect to continue as we said in our press release and earnings and our prepared remarks for the earnings call here gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states okay and then maybe just at a high level i asked before about the cost reductions just how much flexibility do you have to manage through some of the pressures and then specifically in rd expense as that comes in a little bit lower what do you think the longerterm impact is of scaling back on the rd expense is that something you have to consider how its going to impact the pipeline thanks martin p galvan  lannett co inc well first of all let me start with an answer here and i think arthur will add to that as far as the numbers go the rd expense is low for the quarter its a bit more unusually low lets say for the quarter we do expect that to tick up on a run rate basis going forward in our own projections we see rd expense somewhere in the range of  million to  million a quarter something like that and then as kristin arnold gets her feet on the ground here and gets better into – or has more time in position i think well see our spending increase because obviously the pipeline is critical to us arthur do you want to arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc no were not trying to reduce rd for any reason other than the economies looking at consolidating the three sites that was ongoing but we didnt have a leader in that department as you know so our efforts to consolidate rd and set it up so that its operating out of philadelphia really wasnt lets say robust with kristin on board the first thing shes doing is consolidating the sites and setting her sights on what products were going to be going after some of the other delays in product spend for the rd also equate to the lower spend sometimes you plan for biostudy and if you dont get it done in the quarter you dont have an obligation but you get it in the next quarter so its not like weve reduced rd for any purpose other than just timing gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states okay all right thank you arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from gregg gilbert gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc thanks i have a few maybe first for marty can you walk us through this medicaid rebate situation and what about that if anything was surprising to lannett i believe the rules were laid out quite some time ago there martin p galvan  lannett co inc yeah gregg it was not a surprise to us i think what we were saying is that our sales nonetheless were impacted by it the law was something we were very aware of and again was not a surprise gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc okay and as it relates to the two other issues brought up changes in distribution channel as well as increased pricing pressure certainly recognize that the business is always pricecompetitive but can you highlight anything that changed lets say in this quarter versus three to six months ago on those two issues the pricing pressure and change in distribution channel arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well as you know theres been these alliances or consortiums and consortium depends on how anybody pronounces that expression and the latest one of course was one of the wholesalers in one of the chain stores referred to the customer at  walmart that company – that group purchasing claris one  wasnt available previously and it just evolved recently in terms of – actually its still an ongoing process but theyre just formulating and putting out requests for quotes now so that was the newest entry the others were already doing things like that so those we were familiar with and thats the one were really referring to gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc does that feed into the distribution channel comment as well or is that a  arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc yes it does yes it does gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc okay arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc because youre selling directly to the customers youre not selling through in this case the wholesaler to the customer previously we would sell directly to the customer gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then one more sort of big picture strategic question arthur theres always been consolidation in the small midcap generic space but it seems that the dominoes are beginning to fall a bit faster with akorn and upsher and stada any comments from your point of view and whether that affects your thinking at all about lannetts place in the world thanks arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc no but as my chairman said were a public company which means the company is always available for anybody who wants to make an offer to buy it so theres nothing untoward there except theyre running out of things to buy you might say so weve been looking to be the last holdout and we got the best offer or not that depends on the people in the marketplace were not doing anything to dissuade anybody from making any offers and we know that there is a lot of consolidation and quite frankly we expect it thats not something we dont think is going to happen but its just a matter of were waiting our turn gregg gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks ill get back in line arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc okay operator thank you and our next question comes from elliot wilbur elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc hey good afternoon art we may not always be thrilled with your quarterly results but were always thrilled with your choice in classic rock music so my questions is first on the top line obviously performance relatively close to external expectations both in terms of the aggregate number and individual product categories but obviously theres some pressure under the surface could you maybe just talk about the top two or three product categories where you had negative price variance that was quite a bit different than what you had been anticipating and as a followup to that i guess weve heard commentary from a couple of companies weve met the last couple of days now regarding the claris one  consortium suggestion from some others is that pricing pressure tied to that really seemed to kind of gather momentum in march and thats really picked up in april im just wondering if that is consistent with what you experienced in the quarter and what youre currently seeing arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well i wouldnt say that were certainly feeling pricing pressure i mean every customer is looking for a lower price which surprises me because if they buy it for less money theyre going to resell it at a lesser profit so it just punishes the customer when they purchase at those prices we certainly arent immune to pricing pressure because everybody wants to reprice get the product at a lower price because somehow they think theyll make more money trouble is then they sell it based on their new cost so its just a spiral going down weve been less subjected to it you might say than most of the competitors weve been listening to out there but its not were immune to it we are in the generic drug space and clearly theres a focus on price its always been a price business and we have to stay competitive but we really havent seen a severe impact to any one particular product elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc okay and if i could get your latest update and current thoughts around methylphenidate just latest interaction there with fda and whether or not youve had a chance to fully vet all the data that the agency put together regarding this decision to initially go with the bx rating and then obviously followed up with a notice of withdrawal and just kind of what the latest is around that particular product asset arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc all right well the way its working is first of all weve owned this company now a little over  months whats this todays may so were five six – and thats about exactly  months now and quite frankly we havent received any complaints with regard to that particular issue now that weve owned the company and were getting the complaints directly we havent seen one complaint we know the fdas claim that  of the complaints they received was on kremers product so our first question has to do with well where are the complaints you claim you received because we want to see them and that was part of what we asked for under the freedom of information act were trying to get hold of the negative that they used to decide that the product was not abrated and thats the meeting were awaiting and theyve asked us to accept that the language we agreed to to allow them time to get that information collected together and submitted to us once we get that information well then be able to request a meeting date so right now were questioning the fundamental reason for removing the ab rating from our product and quite honestly i think we have a very strong argument with regards to our position there so thats what were hoping in the meantime we continue to sell the product i believe weve picked up some new customers on it so it continues to be a bxrated product and is less expensive than the offline generic thats out there on the abrated from another competitor and as a result people continue to use this product as well as the other bxrated product on the market elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc okay thanks and just one last question i may have missed this in your first initial comments but just any update on the current anda pipeline specifically thinking about sort of the cadence of approval activity obviously in the last quarter of the fiscal year but maybe over the balance of the calendar year as well i know youve been id say optimistic and weve been hopeful that one or two significant products could be approved here relatively shortterm so im just wondering what the latest status update on those is thanks arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc unfortunately were in the same boat as you waiting and waiting and waiting and when we say any day now we literally mean any day we expect to get some approvals thats what we talked about again in the earnings call we expect a number of approvals before our june  fiscal year and i know today is may  which gives us all of a sudden leap certainly  but we do expect some products to come through the problem will be of course at this point theyll come through they will be too late for this fiscal year but theyll certainly be available to us in the fiscal year beginning july  so we just have to be patient as we always are with the fda and await the approvals but theres no reason for us to change what were expecting we are expecting those products to be approved and any day now elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc thank you arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc okay thank you elliot operator thank you and our next question comes from derek archila marcus ho  oppenheimer  co inc hi this is marcus on for derek thanks for taking the questions just a quick question for me it looks like levothyroxine urology is a little softer than expected any kind of color you can provide around that and i know you talked about pricing pressure competition but anything else that you can maybe elaborate on would be great thanks martin p galvan  lannett co inc marcus on levothyroxine its essentially the macro factors that weve been talking about theres nothing in specifics that we want to go into at this point in time and im sorry the second category you asked about arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc yeah i wasnt sure which category you mentioned derek – or marcus marcus ho  oppenheimer  co inc urology arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc urology marcus ho  oppenheimer  co inc yeah arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc that one weve talked about previously the oxybutynin that one has dropped off previous quarters nothing this past quarter i think theres been no difference this quarter over previous quarters lets put it that way martin p galvan  lannett co inc we had a competitor going to the space i think six months ago or so right so yes so this particular category is more of a competitive situation that had been in place and wasnt unusual in this quarter marcus ho  oppenheimer  co inc okay thank you arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc okay martin p galvan  lannett co inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew finkelstein andrew finkelstein  susquehanna financial group lllp hi good evening and thanks for taking the question i was hoping you could talk a bit more about some of the customer contracts you picked up and whether that may continue to translate into volume weve seen increases for a select product going forward but are there opportunities to broaden the base of products you have under contract with these customers and then if you could talk a little bit about as you continue to transfer products to seymour is there room for additional margin improvement there to offset price pressure thanks arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well ill take the first question let marty handle the second one yeah we do expect – as we said our revenue in our units have grown so our sales volume is picking up what youre seeing is the price reduction when you give a customer lower price impacting sales so sales are down on a price basis but theyre not down on a unit basis so we have picked up additional business the unit sales for most of our products have been up at least overall and we expect that trend to continue especially as we get new products we now have more customers to sell those new products to but with the pricing pressure which is somewhat mild as compared to our competitors and as far as were concerned we dont see it impacting us that dramatically unless we actually lose an item as opposed to having to meet a lower price were more concerned about id say losing a product to a competitor outright than matching a lower price which is generally what we have to do so i dont see anything except potential more sales increased sales with a larger customer base as far as the move to seymour ill let marty handle the margin martin p galvan  lannett co inc yes as far as the move has gone andrew the synergy program that we announced over a year ago we talked about significant savings we talked about  million of synergy savings in fiscal  and that number grows by  just to put it in perspective the  million in  roughly half of that number we projected that we would see that in the course of its outline basically with the efficiencies achieved from consolidating manufacturing in seymour in addition that synergy savings grows actually when we get to fiscal  because the moving of manufacturing to seymour we always had that program in place now since the acquisition its a threeyear program so its going to take time and to answer your question yes wed have to see like i said half of the synergy that weve been projecting manifest themselves on the course of this outline so that will help us andrew finkelstein  susquehanna financial group lllp great and if i could slip in a followup with fluphenazine any changes in the competitive dynamics there or anticipating any changes in supply from competitors arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc no were not expecting anything but i cant tell you what the competitors are going to do till they do it but as we speak today theres been no changes there clearly most of the products as i said that we really have had  any major impact on them in a negative way its really more generally pricing people asking for requotes the competitive environment and this is my th year in generic drugs andrew so this is like the same old thing were talking about déjà vu i can sell cheaper than you that seems to be the theme and its not something we didnt anticipate two years ago quite frankly so i think my goal – im not going to be able to stop that spiraling environment because theres too many competitors out there but i certainly could make sure i could survive it with a planned source in topical the work were doing with china the exporting of  of my products there i mean thats a huge opportunity for us so those were the kind of things we needed to do we dont do any exporting as you know currently so those opportunities sure offset the decline that we might see in the competitive marketplace we have in the us andrew finkelstein  susquehanna financial group lllp all right thanks very much arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc okay thank you martin p galvan  lannett co inc thank you operator thank you and next we have a question from matt hewitt charles haff  craighallum capital group hi this is charlie on for matt thanks for taking my questions arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc hi charlie charles haff  craighallum capital group i really just had one a lot of them have been asked now that the debts been paid down you paid down  million this quarter does that remain the priority paying down debt or is ma a possibility arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc no no ma were paying down debt first which should help us so were likely to concentrate on that so all i would say is stay tuned we do intend to continue to pay down debt charles haff  craighallum capital group okay thank you arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc all right thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from scott henry scott robert henry  roth capital partners llc thank you and good afternoon arthur perhaps just a bit of a macro question i guess your fiscal q calendar first quarter was certainly a tougher pricing environment and it sounds like next quarter is going to continue to get tougher the question and its kind of twopart is one do you think this environment starts to stabilize for your fiscal year  or should we expect this continued sort of pricing erosion and then the second part of that question is do you think you can offset enough of this with new products and new markets such that you can grow the revenue base in  which is certainly no small accomplishment in this environment arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well thats true but optimistically we have a lot of opportunities where – we certainly have some opportunities in the small ma world where we purchased some products that well be launching next year so we know for sure were going to have some additional revenue we know at least – well some of the products we already have approved by fda that remember were approved at our philadelphia plant that we were closing had to be moved to seymour so those launches got delayed so between the launches the new products the products we expect to get approved  while i dont want to be an optimist because theres certainly the pricing pressure in terms of units and volume we do see some growth there i cant speak to what the prices will be on each one of these items because of course that determines where you end up but i do feel optimistic about  because a lot of the launches we didnt file this fiscal year will be launched next year we know were getting more approvals from the agency thats a sure thing we know we have this export opportunity with the chinese these are things we didnt have in this fiscal year theres no way all those things wouldnt end up realizing an offset to the pricing environment as far as the pricing environment is concerned theres been a lot of pricing pressure that quite frankly we havent experience as much of it as some of our competitors but were a small company when you drop your prices on an item the impact is far greater when you dont get to launch products because youre in the middle of synergies it just exacerbates that problem but we believe july  of  our fiscal  will probably be a better year and wont be as impacted by pricing as we are this quarter scott robert henry  roth capital partners llc okay fair enough and then a question on the  million reduction you took from the medicaid inflation rebate on a calendar year does that impact any quarters more than others the end of the year beginning of the year or is that a pretty consistent reduction you would expect martin p galvan  lannett co inc i think we think scott itd be fairly consistent it will ebb and flow with sales and our projection right now has our fiscal fourth quarter to be slightly lower than the third quarter but no its not going to change dramatically it would ebb and flow with our sales numbers scott robert henry  roth capital partners llc okay and then the final question on levothyroxine it didnt appear to have a significant impact versus my expectations at least on the revenue side of the equation it seems like revenues were hurt more by a lot of the smaller products and the question is how are levo gross margins in your q relative to q or have the margins had a bigger impact in the total revenues im just trying to get a sense on that specific product martin p galvan  lannett co inc yeah we had some pricing pressure on levo in the quarter arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc if you remember when we gave that pricing to that large customer as they turned more business over to us from our competitors we sold more units but at a lower price scott robert henry  roth capital partners llc okay all right great well thank you for taking the questions arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc okay thanks martin p galvan  lannett co inc thank you scott operator thank you and we have another question from gary nachman gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states hi just a couple of quick followups any update on the doj investigation any recent conversations there and aside from the deal with hec what else can you do to try and expand your presence exus to try and help improve the diversification of the company thanks arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well the doj well its been  months now we havent heard anything from them our outside counsel hasnt heard anything so were of the opinion this has moved on to other companies and theres no longer anything going on with lannett weve been saying that for some time now nothings changed there as far as the other option yes we had opportunities to export some apis from our cody facility weve been in discussions with regards to that and certainly some controlled drug as well so we see next year having probably our first next foreign order with any luck and then the expansion of that export because the countries were talking to and the people were talking about these will be significant volumes in terms of the products themselves based on the market so but i dont have a number in front of me were still working on how long it takes to get these products launched we do know theres an expedited review process one thats an already fda approved product in the us so it doesnt go through their normal channels so im still trying to understand what that means is that  months  months or  months so ill have a little more information that theyre getting back to me within the next few days so i could answer that but theres no question well be doing a lot more exporting next year than weve ever done before the longerterm ones with regards to our ctopical that requires filings in europe we are moving forward with those filings but those take at least im going to say a year to be approved and probably at least another six months or more to file so what were doing is really planting seeds in the european market for our products especially the ctopical for now the other two products were waiting for fda approval on here in the us before we can offer them there so theres two products still waiting for fda approval on that were planning to export so weve been doing a lot of partnering we now have people that want the products are willing to launch them in the european market and the same of course in the chinese market as far as raw materials are concerned we have opportunities to do something with the raw materials we produced at cody as well and those are in the talking stages right now but i have a pretty good optimistic point of view that we will have done some exporting next year for sure gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states yeah can you just clarify on hec how many products youre expecting them to launch in china and order of magnitude how much that could contribute to your top line bottom line arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc well because we dont know what all  products are we know  of them they do want to buy  products thats what theyve committed to  of them weve quoted on already were getting the details as to what they need in the way of – were shipping it to them in bulk we know that we know we have to get some pricing that includes shipments and freight to their destination theyll do the packaging locally the rest of the products were just reviewing with them to see which one of our products they want and probably means another trip there to finalize the products themselves but i dont really have any numbers to give you because we dont have them for ourselves either once we identify the  products theyll give me some estimate as to what size orders theyll place initially and then well have a fairly good idea but we are talking about a very very big market china as you can imagine is three times the size in terms of the population and im not saying were going to sell to everybody in china obviously but if you sold to  of china you have a huge amount of business coming your way and these are products that are not currently available in china so theyll be new introductions and they really feel very comfortable about products that theyre talking to us about im not allowed to say all of them but they have identified categories that theyre interested in and out of respect for their competitive marketplace i dont want to give out too many details but its an overwhelming opportunity for a company our size that much i will say gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states okay thank you arthur p bedrosian jd  lannett co inc thanks operator thank you and we have no
