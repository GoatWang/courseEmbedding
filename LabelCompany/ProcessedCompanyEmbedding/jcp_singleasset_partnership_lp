underperformance and poor corporate governancebelieves new highlyqualified and independent directors should be added to casellas boardstresses importance of direct shareholder representation sep    et from jcp investment management llc table      facebook twitter pinterest chart      facebook twitter pinterest chart      facebook twitter pinterest table      facebook twitter pinterest table  chart  chart  table    houston sept   prnewswire  jcp investment management llc together with its affiliates jcp and the other participants named herein collectively own approximately  of the issued and outstanding class a shares of casella waste systems inc casella or the company nasdaq cwst  today jcp sent an open letter to casellas board of directors the board and filed a detailed investor presentation with the securities and exchange commission in connection with its campaign to elect two highlyqualified directors brett w frazier and james c pappas to the board at the  annual meeting in the presentation jcp outlines in detail its views regarding why immediate change is necessary at casella including the companys history of poor operating and stock price underperformance versus peers and the overall market under the direction of the current management team and board  the investor presentation is available on the secs website and at the following link httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardataexprecapdf the full text of the letter follows september   dear members of the board jcp investment management llc jcp currently owns  class a shares or  of the issued and outstanding class a common stock of casella waste systems inc casella or the company making us one of the companys largest public shareholders  we are longterm shareholders and have been investing in casella since  jcp is an investment firm focused on investing across the capital structure primarily in north america  we have a track record of significant value enhancement at companies in which we have become involved and at which we have gained representation on the board for the last  months we have attempted to communicate constructively with the board of directors of casella the board regarding the companys poor operational and financial performance archaic corporate governance and capital structure that undermine the rights of public shareholders while giving disproportionate voting power to chairman and ceo john casella and his brother vice chairman doug casella our hope was that we could have worked constructively with the board to add class a shareholder representation in the boardroom and improve the board with the experience and perspective that will lead to decisions that tackle the fundamental problems while protecting the rights of public shareholders and enhancing the value of the public shareholders investments unfortunately our attempts to date have been flatly rejected by the board which never even made a counterproposal for an amicable resolution  instead the boards apparent strategy has been to implement tangential changes which were clearly reactive to our involvement but short of addressing the core problems casella has underperformed for over a decade under the leadership of john casella a veteran of  years as chairman and ceo  it is astonishing that a public company ceo who has overseen the companys stock plummet from  a share at its ipo in  to  today could keep his post after  years of underperformance  it is clear to us that the only plausible explanation is that from his position as a chairman and together with his brother a holder of all the supervoting class b stock that entitles him and his brother to more than  of the combined voting power john casella has ensured his position with the company and jeopardized the boards primary responsibility of holding management accountable which has lead to over a decade of underperformance  chairman and ceo casellas rule over the company has been at the expense of the public shareholders who have suffered and continue to suffer significant losses during his tenure   despite their class b shares supervoting rights since casellas has diluted the class a shares from approximately  million shares to nearly  million shares – the class a shares now have a chance to make a change difference  the  voting power of the class b shares is not enough to insulate the management team from poor performance casella has a strong position in the northeast market  by replacing chairman and ceo john casella with a proven leader we believe casella can create meaningful value for its shareholders in the following pages we describe in greater detail a troubling history of underperformance and mismanagement under chairman and ceo john casella making immediate board and ceo change necessary our concerns around related party transactions and a capital structure that entrenches  chairman and ceo john  casella while undermining the rights of the public shareholders and why jcps track record of significant value creation is highly relevant to helping casella overcome its current challenges  a troubling history of underperformance and mismanagement under chairman and ceo john casella under the leadership of chairman and ceo john casella casella has produced a negative return for shareholders over  years and since the ipo  simply stated we have lost all faith in chairman and ceo john casellas ability to lead this large increasingly complex company shareholder returns have suffered dramatically under chairman and ceo john casella casellas stock has produced negative  returns over  years and dramatically underperformed the companys peers and the sp  index over the last  and  years periods capital allocation has been atrocious under chairman and ceo john casella profitability has not followed with incremental cash outlays  it is surprising to us that the board has complacently allowed chairman and ceo john casella to spend more than  million over the last  years in capital expenditures with no resulting increase of earnings power excessive leverage and class a stock dilution have been rampant under chairman and ceo john casella chairman and ceo john casellas use of excessive leverage over the last several years has not produced incremental earning power  along with continuously increasing leverage chairman and ceo john casella also continues to take actions that dilute public shareholders year after year   broken promises and consistently missed guidance under chairman and ceo john casella we are struck by the dramatic magnitude by which chairman and ceo john casella has consistently missed his own announced longterm targets  the following table shows that chairman and ceo john casella has been putting out the same targets since  as shown in the previous chart chairman and ceo john casella has clearly struggled to hit longterm targets  we are concerned with the newest guidance that the company has issued  in  the company issued its first guidance of revenue ebitda and eps  since then chairman and ceo john casella has chronically missed projections and has yet to meet any of his targets  companies that chronically miss targets and fail to produce growth while their peers do both typically change management  yet this board has failed to hold management accountable for its mistakes and shows no sign it plans to do so immediate board and ceo change are necessary in order to halt the value destruction we believe that the companys earnings potential is not being achieved due to poor leadership  casella possesses recurring cash flows talented employees and strong assets with the ability to grow  we firmly believe that in order to improve casellas performance the board must be reconstituted to include direct representatives of the public shareholders who have the commitment and discipline to hold management accountable   our concerns around related party transactions and a capital structure that entrenches chairman and ceo john casella while undermining the rights of the public shareholders during the past  years the company has paid more than  million to casella construction inc casella construction a company of which john casella is both a director and executive officer and his brother doug casella is president  we see a clear conflict with the casella brothers controlling the entities on both ends of these expensive transactions for casella shareholders  we wonder how the best interests of the public interests are adequately protected when the casella brothers siphon this large amount to their affiliated entity  for context the  million paid to casella construction over the course of a decade represents a third of the current market cap of the company  those exorbitant amounts on both absolute and relative basis have continued to be paid to casella construction even as the companys shareholders have suffered significant losses over the same period in which john casella has run the company worse for many years the company led by chairman and ceo john casella paid vice chairman doug casella a salary of more than  and in some years  from a subsidiary of the company  the casellaled board also authorized a loan from the company to the former coo of the company in the amount of nearly  million  that loan was made at the prime rate while the company was borrowing more expensively at significantly higher rates  it is concerning both that chairman and ceo john casella would allow the company to borrow at a higher rate than he is lending and without a maturity and that the rest of the board would complacently go along with these selfserving activities  this persistent pattern of costly related party transactions raises serious questions as to whether john casellas actions appropriately place the best interests of public shareholders above his personal interests and those of other insiders chairman and ceo john casellas grip on the board and the company has been aided by the companys dual class stock structure that creates a gap between the economic investment of shareholders and their voting power  the class b shares which have  votes per share are  held by chairman and ceo john casella and his brother and vice chairman of the company doug casella  the class b shares entitle the casella brothers to more than  of the voting power of the class a and class b combined  this unbalanced capitalization structure effectively allows insider control with a lesser economic stake in the company and significantly impairs the rights of public shareholders  together the supervoting rights and the combined chairman and ceo roles give john casella undue influence over the company ensure his longevity despite chronic failures and drive deep misalignment between his interests on the one hand and those of the public shareholders on the other   jcps capabilities and record of value creation are highly relevant to casellas current challenges casella now finds itself in a predicament – lack of leadership who can create value a poorlyaligned board and a  year track record of value destruction  shareholders can no longer afford to watch in silence as the company languishes due to ceo john casellas poor performance and the boards failure to hold the ceo and management accountable  jcp has the experience and alignment of interest required to fix casellas problems jcp is seeking real change on the board of casella with the addition of candidates who have the commitment and discipline to fight for the right of public shareholders jcp has nominated and intends to seek the election of james pappas and brett frazier to the board at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders of casella  messrs pappas and frazier have the skill sets and commitment to protect shareholder rights and shareholder value  our recent communications with the board have persuaded us that the pervasive and blatant disregard for shareholder input and subservient attitude to john casella plague the current board and render it incapable of fixing the core issues facing the company  jcp is prepared to identify potential replacement ceo candidates jcp has replaced sitting chairman andor ceos in the past at the pantry and morgans respectively and is prepared to do the same at casella  our diligent and long term work at the pantry and morgans produced a significant amount of value for shareholders  both of these situations took significant time and effort  we are prepared to work just as hard this time                      the dismal operating performance under chairman and ceo john casellas leadership the deeply concerning related party transactions and the lack of accountability of both the board and ceo all solidify our view that material change in executive leadership and corporate governance are immediately required at casella casella has significant value creating opportunities and talented employees  with the right leadership alignment of interests and governance structures in place we are confident that the company can deliver substantial value for all stakeholders  sincerely james c pappas certain

prnewswire  jcp investment management llc together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation collectively jcp or we collectively one of the largest stockholders of fiesta restaurant group inc fiesta or the company frgi with aggregate ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding shares today issued a letter to the chairman of fiestas board of directors the full text of the letter followsapril  fiesta restaurant group inc  landmark boulevard suite  dallas texas  attn    stacey rauch chairman of the boarddear staceyas you know we own approximately  of the outstanding shares of fiesta restaurant group inc fiesta or the company making us the companys third largest stockholder dating back to august of last year we have sought to work constructively with fiestas board of directors the board and management team in an effort to drive stockholder value and improve the companys corporate governance following the companys apparent unwillingness to entertain serious discussions regarding board refreshment we nominated a slate of three highly qualified individuals for election to the board at the upcoming annual meeting that we believe would greatly enhance the boarddespite our nomination we continued to seek an amicable resolution with the board in an effort to avoid an expensive and time consuming proxy contest unfortunately we do not believe that the boards recent offer adequately addresses the shortcomings of the composition of the board or protects the best interests of the companys stockholdersthe driving factor behind our belief is the makeup of the current sevenmember board six of the seven incumbent directors have overseen a  decline in fiestas share price from its  peak and under their leadership the companys total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one two and threeyear periods these same directors authorized the expenditure of more than  million on the failed expansion of pollo tropical into texas and oversaw a corporate structure with bloated sga expenses including three corporate centers in addition the recent performance of the company is concerning with transaction counts down  and  respectively at taco cabana and pollo tropical in the fourth quarter of   furthermore the board consists largely of directors with little to no industry operating experience nor any personal investment in fiesta stock in fact paul e twohig who was just appointed as a director effective february   is the only director who has made an open market purchase of fiesta shares in addition we note that three of the seven directors are affiliated with jefferies including directors barry j alperin and brian p friedman who are up for election at the upcoming annual meeting it should be noted that jefferies sold its entire position in  after previously owning approximately  of the company at the time of its spinoff in while we welcome the appointment of mr twohig to the board who we believe is independent and brings considerable industry expertise we do not think his addition alone is sufficient to offset the lack of industry experience and apparent misalignment of interests between the incumbent directors and fiestas stockholdersas such we find the boards recent offer contemplating the addition of one of our candidates now and a separate individual to be identified by the board at a later date to be unacceptable given the lack of assurance that the person selected would be mutually agreeable to both parties in addition we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a multiyear standstill period given the current classified board structure because we believe this would effectively serve to further entrench the incumbent directors who have overseen significant destruction of stockholder value  we strongly believe that any potential agreement must involve the immediate addition of two highly qualified director candidates who together will bring significant operating experience and an owners perspective into the boardroom we believe adding such individuals to the board would remedy the boards apparent lack of restaurant expertise and avoid a seemingly unnecessary election contest which we believe could only benefit the entrenched directors who we do not believe belong on the board therefore to simplify the choice for stockholders at the upcoming annual meeting we intend to withdraw our nomination of joshua e schechter and seek the election of our remaining candidates james c pappas and john b morlock both of whom have significant experience in the restaurant industry in opposition to messrs alperin and friedmanread morewhile we remain open to a collaborative process regarding board composition we are fully prepared to see this through to a vote at the upcoming annual meeting if necessary to ensure that stockholders have the opportunity to vote for the most highly qualified candidates to represent their interestswe look forward to your
