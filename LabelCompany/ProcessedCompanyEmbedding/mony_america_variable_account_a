its contracts more attractive to existing contract owners or to prospective purchasers as the case may be each insurance company has reviewed its contracts and each investment option offered under its contracts with the goal of providing a superior choice of investment alternatives the substitutions are being proposed to address the lack of contract owner interest in the removed portfolios which generally have not attracted sufficient contract owner interest to support maintaining them as separate investment options under the contracts particularly where they duplicate or substantially overlap with other investment options offered through the separate accounts the substitutions also are intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the contracts and the investment options available through the separate accounts additionally each substitution will substitute shares of the replacement portfolio for shares of the removed portfolio which has similar investment objectives policies and risks as the replacement portfolio in addition the insurance companies have agreed to impose certain expense limits with respect to the replacement portfolios for certain periods after the substitutions as described below furthermore the substitutions ultimately may enable the insurance companies to reduce certain of the costs that they incur in administering the contracts by removing overlapping and unpopular portfolios moreover the proposed substitutions would replace an unaffiliated portfolio with a portfolio for which axa equitable serves as manager and thus would permit axa equitable to appoint dismiss and replace advisers and amend advisory agreements as necessary to seek optimal performance from the portfolio and its portfolio managers finally the substitutions are designed to provide contract owners with an opportunity to continue their investment in a similar portfolio without interruption and without any cost to them  the insurance companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the substitutions and related filings and notices including legal accounting brokerage and other fees and expenses on the effective date of the substitutions “substitution date” the amount of any contract owners contract value or the dollar value of a contract owners investment in the relevant contract will not change as

substitutions pursuant to section  of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts each substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the removed portfolio in cash andor inkind on the substitution date at their net asset value and using the

owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the insurance companies obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including any brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the

greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions all contractlevel fees will remain the same after the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because each proposed substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing start printed page the

substitutions will the insurance companies increase the total separate account charges net of any waiver or reimbursements of each contract outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without commission approval section c provides that “the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title” section c protects the expectation of investors that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer and is intended to ensure that unnecessary or burdensome sales loads additional reinvestment costs and other charges will not be incurred due to unapproved substitutions of securities  the proposed substitutions involve a substitution of securities within the meaning of section c of the  act the section  applicants therefore request an order from the commission pursuant to section c approving the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants have reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the contracts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right the section  applicants have reserved this right of substitution both to protect themselves and their contract owners in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a separate account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the insurance companies and their respective contract owners  applicants assert that each replacement portfolio and its corresponding removed portfolio have similar and in some cases substantially similar or identical investment objectives policies and risks in addition the proposed substitutions retain for contract owners the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the contracts according to the applicants any impact on the investment programs of affected contract owners including the appropriateness of the available investment options should therefore be negligible  applicants maintain that the ultimate effect of each substitution would be to remove overlapping and duplicative investment options and that each substitution will permit each insurance company to present information to its contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner applicants anticipate that after each proposed substitution contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their contracts  applicants also state that as a result of each proposed substitution contract owners with subaccount balances invested in each replacement portfolio will have lower net operating expenses each insurance company has agreed to impose a two year expense limit except with respect to the proposed substitutions involving the lord abbett series fund—growth and income portfolio pimco variable insurance trust—real return portfolio and lord abbett series fund—bonddebenture portfolio for which each insurance company has agreed to impose an expense limit for the life of each contract so that the sum of each replacement portfolios net operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio assetbased charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the corresponding removed portfolios net operating expense ratio and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year   applicants contend that therefore each substitution protects the contract owners who have allocated contract value to each removed portfolio by i providing an underlying investment option for subaccounts invested in the removed portfolio that is similar to the removed portfolio ii providing such contract owners with simpler disclosure documents and iii providing such contract owners with an investment option that would have net operating start printed page expenses that are lower than the current investment option  applicants assert that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute investment securities in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to contract owners under their contracts additionally the section  applicants claim that the substitutions will not in any manner reduce the nature or quality of the available investment options moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying contract owners of the proposed substitutions which supplement will be delivered to contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitutions and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution date the substitutions therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent  applicants maintain that the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract contract owners select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their contract values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the section  applicants under the applicable contract as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the contract contract owners also may have considered the insurance companys size financial condition and its reputation for service in selecting their contract these factors will not change as a result of the proposed substitution  section a of the  act prohibits any affiliated person as defined in section a of the  act of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the same persons acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  the section  applicants state that shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company and that the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own substantially all of the shares of eqat accordingly eqat and its respective portfolios are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that the contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if eqat is under the common control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of eqat and its respective portfolios if eqat and its respective portfolios are under the control of the insurance companies then eqat and its respective affiliates are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  the section  applicants note that regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control eqat and its respective portfolios because the insurance companies and their affiliates own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement portfolios investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of eqat and its respective portfolios likewise eqats respective portfolios are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies  in addition to the above the insurance companies through their respective separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of certain of the removed portfolios including the dreyfus variable investment fund—international value portfolio lord abbett series fund—bonddebenture portfolio t rowe price fixed income series inc—prime reserve portfolio old mutual insurance series fund—midcap portfolio and pimco variable insurance trust—real return portfolio therefore each insurance company is an affiliated person of those portfolios  the section  applicants state that the proposed inkind transactions could be seen as the indirect purchase of shares of certain replacement portfolios with portfolio securities of certain removed portfolios and the indirect sale of portfolio securities of certain removed portfolios for shares of certain replacement portfolios pursuant to this analysis the proposed inkind transactions also could be categorized as a purchase of shares of certain replacement portfolios by certain removed portfolios acting as principal and a sale of portfolio securities by certain removed portfolios acting as principal to certain replacement portfolios in addition the proposed inkind transactions could be viewed as a purchase of securities from certain removed portfolios and a sale of securities to certain replacement portfolios by mony or mloa or their separate accounts acting as principal if categorized in this manner the proposed inkind transactions may be deemed to contravene section a due to the affiliated status of these participants  rule a under the  act exempts from the prohibitions of section a subject to certain enumerated conditions a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies or separate series of registered investment companies which are affiliated persons or affiliated persons of affiliated persons of each other between separate series of a registered investment company or between a registered investment company or a separate series of a registered investment company and a person which is an affiliated person of such registered investment company or affiliated person of such person solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of each other common directors andor common officers  mony mloa their separate accounts certain removed portfolios and certain replacement portfolios in connection with their participation in the proposed inkind transactions must rely on that portion of rule a that requires that they be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or affiliated investment advisers common directors andor common officers that is not the case as detailed above moreover one of the conditions enumerated in rule a requires that the transaction be a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are readily available if the proposed inkind transactions are viewed as purchases and sales of securities the consideration in the proposed redemptions of shares of certain removed portfolios and the proposed purchases of shares of certain replacement portfolios would not be cash but would be the portfolio securities received from the removed portfolio  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application issue an order start printed page exempting any proposed transaction from section a if i the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned ii the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and iii the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants request an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind transactions in connection with the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the policies of the relevant removed portfolios and the relevant corresponding replacement portfolios as recited in the current registration statement and reports of the relevant investment company filed with the commission under the federal securities laws finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants state that they will assure themselves that the investment companies will carry out the proposed inkind transactions in conformity with the conditions of rule a or as applicable a removed portfolios and a replacement portfolios normal valuation procedures as set forth in the relevant investment companys registration statement except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash the inkind transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of each removed portfolio and the corresponding replacement portfolio as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the portfolios registration statements and as required by rule c under the  act the inkind transactions will not change the dollar value of any contract owners investment in any of the separate accounts the value of any contract the accumulation value or other value credited to any contract or the death benefit payable under any contract after the proposed inkind transactions the value of a separate accounts investment in a replacement portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the removed portfolio together with the value of any preexisting investments in the replacement portfolio before the inkind transactions  when the commission initially proposed and adopted rule a it noted that the purpose of the rule was to eliminate the filing and processing of applications “in circumstances where there appears to be no likelihood that the statutory finding for a specific exemption under section b could not be made” by establishing “conditions as to the availability of the exemption to those situations where the commission upon the basis of its experience considers that there is no likelihood of overreaching of the investment companies participating in the transaction” when the commission amended rule a in  to cover transactions involving noninvestment company affiliates it indicated that such transactions could be reasonable and fair and not involve overreaching if appropriate conditions were imposed on the transaction in this regard the section  applicants state they will assure themselves that the inkind transactions will be in substantial compliance with the conditions of rule a under the  act the section  applicants assert that because the proposed inkind transactions would comply in substance with the principal conditions of rule a the commission should consider the extent to which the inkind transactions would meet these or other similar conditions and issue an order if such conditions would provide the substance of the protections embodied in rule a  the section  applicants state that the proposed inkind transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio securities as specified in paragraph b of rule a the proposed inkind transactions will comply with paragraph d of rule a because no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration except for any customary transfer fees will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed inkind transactions furthermore a written record of the proposed inkind transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with paragraph g of rule a with respect to those securities for which market quotations are not readily available the substitutions will be effected in accordance with the relevant removed portfolios and the relevant corresponding replacement portfolios normal valuation procedures as set forth in the registration statement for the relevant investment company  even though the proposed inkind transactions will not comply with the cash consideration requirement of paragraph a of rule a the section  applicants state that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions will offer to each of the relevant removed portfolios and each of the relevant replacement portfolios the same degree of protection from overreaching that rule a generally provides in connection with the purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of business in particular the insurance companies and their affiliates cannot effect the proposed inkind transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any replacement portfolio  the section  applicants represent that the proposed redemption of shares of each of the relevant removed portfolios will be consistent with the investment policies of each removed portfolio and the corresponding replacement portfolio as recited in their respective current registration statements provided that the shares are redeemed at their net asset value in conformity with rule c under the  act likewise the proposed sale of shares of each of the relevant replacement portfolios for investment securities is consistent with the investment policies of the relevant replacement portfolio as recited in the relevant trusts registration statement provided that i the shares are sold at their net asset value and ii the investment securities are of the type and quality that a replacement portfolio could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash to assure the second of these conditions is met the manager and relevant adviser will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement portfolio and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such portfolio in a cash transaction  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act and that the proposed inkind transactions do not present any conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent in particular sections b and b of the  act state among other things that the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected “when investment companies are organized operated managed or their portfolio securities are selected in the start printed page interest of directors officers investment advisers depositors or other affiliated persons thereof    or in the interest of other investment companies or persons engaged in other lines of business rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies security holders    when investment companies issue securities containing inequitable or discriminatory provisions or fail to protect the preferences and privileges of holders in their outstanding securities” as explained above the terms of the proposed inkind transactions are designed to prevent the abuses described in sections b and b of the  act  the section  applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the terms of the proposed inkind transactions as set forth in the application including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair to i each of the relevant replacement portfolios and each of the relevant removed portfolios and ii contract owners the section  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned furthermore the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind transactions are or will be consistent with all relevant policies of i the relevant replacement portfolios and the relevant removed portfolios as stated in the relevant investment companys registration statement and reports filed under the  act and ii the general purposes of the  act conclusion for the reasons set forth in the application the section  applicants and the section  applicants respectively state that the proposed substitutions and the related inkind transactions meet the
