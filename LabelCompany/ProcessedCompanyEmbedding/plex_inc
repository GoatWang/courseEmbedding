benefitssenior managementcurrent employee  customer success in troy micurrent employee  customer success in troy mirecommendspositive outlooki have been working at plex systems inc fulltime more than  yearspros at the beginning of the year things werenot so fun at plex the product redesign was late the workload was increasing promised headcount additions werent coming through and moral was low as winter turned to spring something very refreshing came out of the company meeting that changed my perspective of plex  honesty revenue targets were lowered our board of directors finally understood that the growth they modeled in excel wasnt going to happen by hiring n salespeople i feel bad for those that were let go but i sometimes wonder if those requisitions ever should have existed in the first place the truth is that the product wasnt ready for the kind of customers they thought they were going to sell to that doesnt mean the product isnt robust it just means that we need to spend a bit more on adding featurespolish to compete against our larger competition and thats ok spring brought investments in tooling and process workflow that finally started to show some results if youre not measuring your performance youre just guessing internal quality metrics were published which was fantastic to see data doesnt lie im glad plex made investments in this area it was very much needed while summer at plex has been busy we’re finally getting the headcount in certain areas that we were promised at the beginning of year hackathons are coming yes this is an extremely important recruiting tool  continual self improvementcreativity should be a core tenant of plex culture we made a strategic acquisition that seems to be a good fit time will tell healthy snacks thanks for the additional weekly fruit from ninos  cons still quite a bit of politics let’s talk about the elephant in the room – key management positions are not held by people with global manufacturing experience if you want to grow the product into something that punches above its weight you need people from fortune  manufacturing companies that have extensive manufacturingsupply chain experience we’re presently clueless about how to grow the product – we ask our top  by their subscription revenue customers what they want to see built what just because they want something developed doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right strategic investment for plex the fact we’re guessing on what to build next is scary to me we need talent from intelgmfordgedell or consultants from pwcernst  young deloitte kpmg who have worked on large global manufacturing projects and know what large customers are looking for directing product development the current product management decisions do not inspire confidenceadvice to management keep the administrative  sales vs product development  support ratio in balance let the product sell itself ultimately the market will discover the true value of what youre offering it always does i understand the desire to attract talent outside of detroit but the number of key personnelmanagers working remotely outside of troy is still too large how can these people make any sort of meaningful impact on the product without actually working face to face with the people that are buildingusing it on a day to day basis again be honest with yourself  you need to be here to shape product design we need people that are passionate about plexs success  if you arent at tower building the product or influencing how it should be built you are a bc player in it for the compensation alevel players are passionate about their work because its an extension of who they are if these out of state people you hired are so talented help  relocate them to troy either go all the way with the investment or hire local  this half way stuff isnt good for plex or the remote hire and look i get that we live in a world where skype for businesswebexzoom is just a tap away on our iphone  that still does not replace being at tower down on the engineeringimplementationsupport floors true leaders lead the charge with the troops and are down in the foxhole from time to time they don’t issue edicts from the boardroom since i’m assuming the board is financially astute i very much hope you’re following the peculiar movements of us equity markets – it seems the market is levitating upward based on earnings misses macy’s  berkshire hatahaway that beat expectations this sort of  craziness is usually followed by a harsh recession the fed has propped up asset prices to an untenable level and things will be correcting soon although markets can stay irrational longer than shorts can stay liquid i’m glad we’re looking to break even financially by the end of the year please keep a healthy cash position in  so plex can weather the storm winter is coming be honest with yourself the product the employees and the customers eventually the truth always reveals

united states medical more  tekniplex inc tekniplex incs new medical molding plant in suzhou china tekniplex inc is expanding its global footprint and product offerings through two of its subsidiaries first the firm is investing  million for a new manufacturing facility in suzhou near shanghai officials said it represents the single largest recent investment by tekniplex responding to the growing needs of the asiapacific pharmaceutical and medical device markets the site will manufacture products from three of the firms units — natvar colorite and action technology in a joint move the facility will produce natvars recently announced silicone extrusion tubing capabilities for catheters feeding tubes drug delivery and peristaltic pump applications as well as microextrusion tubing that targets many neurovascular interventional therapies and surgical applications and in the us tekniplexs colorite unit recently established a new dedicated line for tpe extrusion at its holland ohio facility localizing its cellenebranded line of tpes in north america for medical devices packaging and other regulated markets the new china facility offers specialized space for building a medical component and assembly business as well as opportunities in silicone russell hubbard — vice president international and general manager tekniplex technologies suzhou — said in an email it complements the new investments in costa rica with stateoftheart facilities and strengthens our testing capabilities in asiamore space needed the suzhou plant spans  square feet and is only about  miles away from its current suzhou site which it is designed to replace hubbard said the facility will employ about  with more jobs as business dictates he added that while the new factory has comparable total space it also has a better layout and material flow it provides about five times the clean room space compared to its former facility production has stopped at the old location and hubbard said almost all of the employees from the old site have accepted jobs at the new one weve been working for the last three or so years on putting up a new facility in china natvar general manager bob donohue said the reason we moved is we outgrew the environment we needed to open a new facility with larger clean rooms and better flow for increased silicone extrusion injection molding and microextrusion production capacity the facility is designed to give tekniplex a stronger presence in what it views as a growing chinese market for medical devices the firm said natvars new tighttolerance microextrusion silicone medical tubing and overall expansion of its silicone extrusion capabilities should give it a key advantage the firm currently has microextrusion capacity in costa rica to serve the latin america market there arent a lot of local suppliers in china for silicone products donohue said there was a need and we had a lot of customers that were asking us to manufacture these products in china for medical applications colorites compounding arm is projected to be operational by september hubbard said action technologies products including dip tubing and other capabilities have begun operations at the facilitycoming to america heath schmid director of business development at tekniplex said colorites decision to localize cellene production is in response to a trend in the medical field to move away from pvcsourced products currently the firms line of tpes consists of about  core products with the ability to custom formulate off of that platform to address more specific needs these materials are recyclable schmid said when youre going to a tpe versus a silicone or a rubber there is a cost advantage theres also a specific gravity advantage so youre getting the best of both worlds your cost per pound is much more affordable than that of a rubber or silicone a lot of applications that use rubber or silicone are overengineered and these compounds lend themselves well as alternative materials for those kinds of compounds the official north american launch of the line was at mdm west in february and the firm also highlighted cellene at mdm east in june the products previously were produced only at colorites ireland facility and now are localized in ohio with the addition of an extrusion line schmid said the firm primarily is targeting the medical market but also sees opportunities in food packing schmid did not disclose how much tekniplex invested in the new holland line but said it was substantial he added that additional investment might be required as the business grows further as the global landscape changes there is greater pressure to compete on a global level schmid said oems are being driven by regulatory bodies to offer alternatives to pvc
