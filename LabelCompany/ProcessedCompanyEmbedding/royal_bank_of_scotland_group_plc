footprints during the late s and early s the royal bank was the subject of three separate takeover approaches in  lloyds bank which had previously built up a  stake in the royal bank made a takeover approach for the remaining shares it did not own the offer was rejected by the board of directors on the basis that it was detrimental to the banks operations however when the standard chartered bank proposed a merger with the royal bank in  the board responded favourably standard chartered bank was headquartered in london although most of its operations were in the far east and the royal bank saw advantages in creating a truly international banking group approval was received from the bank of england and the two banks agreed a merger plan that would have seen the standard chartered acquire the royal bank and keep the uk operations based in edinburgh however the bid was scuppered by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc which tabled a rival offer the bid by hsbc was not backed by the bank of england and was subsequently rejected by the royal banks board however the british government referred both bids to the monopolies and mergers commission both were subsequently rejected

the deal by selling off many of the natwest’s subsidiary companies including ulster bank and coutts however the royal bank subsequently tabled a counteroffer sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in uk corporate history a key differentiation from the bank of scotland’s bid was the royal bank’s plan to retain all of natwest’s subsidiaries although natwest one of the big  english clearing banks was significantly larger than either scottish bank it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company legal  general were not well received prompting a  fall in share price on  february  the royal bank of scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle becoming the second largest banking group in the uk after hsbc holdings natwest and the

scotland were paid more than £ million in late  and total bonus payouts reached nearly £ billion – even though the bailedout bank reported losses of £ billion for  unions were baffled that any bankers

was press controversy about hesters bonus—hester was offered share options with a total value of £ that would be held in longterm plans and only paid out if he met strict and tough targets if he failed to do this it would be clawedback the treasury permitted the payment because they feared the resignation of hester and much of the board if the payment was vetoed by the government as the majority shareholder after a large amount of criticism in the press news emerged of chairman sir philip hampton turning down his own bonus of £ million several weeks before the controversy hester who had been on holiday in switzerland at the time turned down his own bonus shortly after in june  a failure of an upgrade to payment processing software meant that a substantial proportion of customers

branches all transferred to the royal bank name the holding company was renamed the royal bank of scotland group in  takeover bidsedit royal bank of scotland group footprints during the late s and early s the royal bank was the subject of three separate takeover approaches in  lloyds bank which had previously built up a  stake in the royal bank made a takeover approach for the remaining shares it did not own the offer was rejected by the board of directors on the basis that it was detrimental to the banks operations however when the standard chartered bank proposed a merger with the royal bank in  the board responded favourably standard chartered bank was headquartered in london although most of its operations were in the far east and the royal bank saw advantages in creating a truly international banking group approval was received from the bank of england and the two banks agreed a merger plan that would have seen the standard chartered acquire the royal bank and keep the uk operations based in edinburgh however the bid was scuppered by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc which tabled a rival offer the bid by hsbc was not backed by the bank of england and was subsequently rejected by the royal banks board however the british government referred both bids to the monopolies and mergers commission both were subsequently rejected as being against the public interest the bank did obtain an international partnership with banco santander central hispano of spain each bank taking a  stake in the other however this arrangement ended in  when banco

the natwest’s subsidiary companies including ulster bank and coutts however the royal bank subsequently tabled a counteroffer sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in uk corporate history a key differentiation from the bank of scotland’s bid was the royal bank’s plan to retain all of natwest’s subsidiaries although natwest one of the big  english clearing banks was significantly larger than either scottish bank it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company legal  general were not well received prompting a  fall in share price on  february  the royal bank of scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle becoming the second largest banking group in the uk after hsbc holdings natwest and the royal bank of scotland

under the supervision of fred goodwin in september  rbs and natwest announced dramatic cuts in their overdraft fees including the unpaid item fee from £ to £ the card misuse fee from £ to £ and the monthly maintenance charge for going overdrawn without consent from £ to £ the cuts came at a time when the row over the legality of unauthorised borrowing reached the house of lords the fees were

scotland were paid more than £ million in late  and total bonus payouts reached nearly £ billion – even though the bailedout bank reported losses of £ billion for  unions were baffled that any bankers

million the ceo stephen hester got £ million in payments for the year in october  moodys downgraded the credit rating of  uk financial firms including rbs blaming financial weakness in january  there was press controversy about hesters bonus—hester was offered share options with a total value of £ that would be held in longterm plans and only paid out if he met strict and tough targets if he failed to do this it would be clawedback the treasury permitted the payment because they feared the resignation of hester and much of the board if the payment was vetoed by the government as the majority shareholder after a large amount of criticism in the press news emerged of chairman sir philip hampton turning down his own bonus of £ million several weeks before the controversy hester who had been on holiday in switzerland at the time turned down his own bonus shortly after in june  a failure of an upgrade to payment processing software meant that a substantial proportion of customers

centred on the issue of banknotes the policy of the royal bank was to either drive the bank of scotland out of business or take it over on favourable terms the royal bank built up large holdings of the bank of scotlands notes which it acquired in exchange for its own notes then suddenly presented to the bank of scotland for payment to pay these notes the bank of scotland was forced to call in its loans and in march  to suspend payments the suspension relieved the immediate pressure on the bank of scotland at the cost of substantial damage to its reputation and gave the royal bank a clear space to expand its own business—although the royal banks increased note issue also made it more vulnerable to the same tactics despite talk of a merger with the bank of scotland the royal bank did not possess the wherewithal to complete the deal by september  the bank of scotland was able to start redeeming its notes again with interest and in march  it resumed lending to prevent similar attacks in the future the bank of scotland put an option clause on its notes giving it the right to make the notes interestbearing while delaying payment for six months the royal bank followed suit

footprints during the late s and early s the royal bank was the subject of three separate takeover approaches in  lloyds bank which had previously built up a  stake in the royal bank made a takeover approach for the remaining shares it did not own the offer was rejected by the board of directors on the basis that it was detrimental to the banks operations however when the standard chartered bank proposed a merger with the royal bank in  the board responded favourably standard chartered bank was headquartered in london although most of its operations were in the far east and the royal bank saw advantages in creating a truly international banking group approval was received from the bank of england and the two banks agreed a merger plan that would have seen the standard chartered acquire the royal bank and keep the uk operations based in edinburgh however the bid was scuppered by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc which tabled a rival offer the bid by hsbc was not backed by the bank of england and was subsequently rejected by the royal banks board however the british government referred both bids to the monopolies and mergers commission both were subsequently rejected as being against the public interest the bank did obtain an international partnership with banco santander central hispano of spain each bank taking a  stake in the other however this arrangement

the deal by selling off many of the natwest’s subsidiary companies including ulster bank and coutts however the royal bank subsequently tabled a counteroffer sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in uk corporate history a key differentiation from the bank of scotland’s bid was the royal bank’s plan to retain all of natwest’s subsidiaries although natwest one of the big  english clearing banks was significantly larger than either scottish bank it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company legal  general were not well received prompting a  fall in share price on  february  the royal bank of scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle becoming the second largest banking group in the uk after hsbc holdings natwest and the royal bank of scotland became subsidiaries of the holding company the royal bank of scotland group natwest as a distinct banking brand was retained although many back office functions of the bank were

branches all transferred to the royal bank name the holding company was renamed the royal bank of scotland group in  takeover bidsedit royal bank of scotland group footprints during the late s and early s the royal bank was the subject of three separate takeover approaches in  lloyds bank which had previously built up a  stake in the royal bank made a takeover approach for the remaining shares it did not own the offer was rejected by the board of directors on the basis that it was detrimental to the banks operations however when the standard chartered bank proposed a merger with the royal bank in  the board responded favourably standard chartered bank was headquartered in london although most of its operations were in the far east and the royal bank saw advantages in creating a truly international banking group approval was received from the bank of england and the two banks agreed a merger plan that would have seen the standard chartered acquire the royal bank and keep the uk operations based in edinburgh however the bid was scuppered by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc which tabled a rival offer the bid by hsbc was not backed by the bank of england and was subsequently rejected by the royal banks board however the british government referred both bids to the monopolies and mergers commission both were subsequently rejected as being against the public interest the bank did obtain an international partnership with banco santander central hispano of spain each bank taking a  stake in the other however this arrangement ended in  when banco

the natwest’s subsidiary companies including ulster bank and coutts however the royal bank subsequently tabled a counteroffer sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in uk corporate history a key differentiation from the bank of scotland’s bid was the royal bank’s plan to retain all of natwest’s subsidiaries although natwest one of the big  english clearing banks was significantly larger than either scottish bank it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company legal  general were not well received prompting a  fall in share price on  february  the royal bank of scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle becoming the second largest banking group in the uk after hsbc holdings natwest and the royal bank of scotland
