receive press releases by email may   blackstone holdings i ii iii and iv lp rated a outlook stable overview we expect the companys cash earnings to be stable and its balance sheet to remain strong we are assigning an initial rating to blackstone holdings i ii iii and iv lp of a an upgrade is unlikely until general economic conditions improve rating action on may   standard  poors ratings services assigned its a longterm counterparty credit rating to the blackstone partnerships blackstone holdings i lp blackstone holdings ii lp blackstone holdings iii lp and blackstone holdings iv lp collectively blackstone the outlook is stable rationale the ratings are supported by stable recurring revenue and cashflow streams diverse businesses a strong balance sheet and a high level of transparency additional support comes from the patient and conservative approach applied to all aspects of its business and a marketbeating longterm track record demonstrating good performance throughout economic cycles the blackstone group lp nyse bx is a listed public company subject to sarbanes oxley and sec reporting requirements which enhances our view of governance practices the ipo brought  billion of permanent capital onto the balance sheet which was already fortified with significant cash and shortterm investment holdings blackstone has a globally respected brand and a diverse array of businesses with countercyclical elements longstanding institutional limited partners are broadly diversified blackstone has a partnership culture that drives intellectual capital across the firm and aligns interests of public and inside holders partners have strong incentives to remain with blackstone preserving and attracting new talent reputation risk slowing deal flow and large writedowns on fund investments partly balance our positive view of blackstones credit profile we believe the firm is exposed to reputation risk because over time the possibility of fund level returns failing to outperform the public equity markets could harm the brand in addition slowing deal flow in the firms private equity and real estate businesses could hurt future realizations accordingly we expect income from transactions and investment realizations to be muted through  finally recent writedowns have affected financial performance the blackstone group is a publicly traded global alternative asset manager and provider of financial advisory services with total feeearning assets under management of about  billion as of dec   business lines include the management of corporate private equity funds real estate funds funds of hedge funds creditoriented funds collateralized loan obligations and closedend mutual funds blackstone also provides a diverse array of advisory services outlook the stable outlook balances blackstones lack of balancesheet risk the firms success in recent fundraising efforts and strong performance in many of its countercyclical advisory businesses against the likelihood that private equity and real estate transaction volumes will remain slow and that asset valuations in its funds will suffer in the current recession the outlook also incorporates our expectation that reported earnings will be weak or negative through  management will limit leverage at the holding company and the balance sheet will remain strong an upgrade is unlikely in the current economic environment when economic conditions improve we could upgrade blackstone if the business continues to grow in balanced fashion either in existing or new businesses or opportunistically through acquisitions significant realized investment gains could further strengthen the balance sheet and lead to an upgrade we could downgrade blackstone if leverage increases from less than  billion to more than  billion driving the debttodebt plus equity ratio beyond  or if deployment of cash calls balancesheet liquidity into question we could also downgrade blackstone if the brand is impaired making retaining existing or raising new funds difficult ratings list new rating outlook action blackstone holdings i lp blackstone holdings iv lp blackstone holdings iii lp

holdback percentage ” the applicable holdback percentages initially shall be  for existing partners other than the general partner  for the holdings  for retaining withdrawn partners and  for deceased partners the “ initial holdback percentages ” ii the holdback percentage may not be reduced for any individual partner as compared to the other partners in his partner category except as provided in clause iv below the general partner may only reduce the holdback percentages among the partner categories on a proportionate basis provided that the holdback percentage applicable to holdings may not be increased or decreased without its consent for example if the holdback percentage for existing partners is decreased to  the holdback percentage for retaining withdrawn partners and deceased partners shall be reduced to  and  respectively any reduction in the holdback percentage for any partner shall apply only to distributions relating to carried interest made after the date of such reduction iii the holdback percentage may not be increased for any individual partner as compared to the other partners in his partner category except as provided in clause iv below the general partner may not increase the retaining withdrawn partners’ holdback percentage beyond  unless the general partner concurrently increases the existing partners’ holdback percentage to  the general partner may not increase the deceased partners’ holdback      percentage beyond  unless the general partner increases the holdback percentage for both existing partners and retaining withdrawn partners to  the general partner may not increase the holdback percentage of any partner category beyond  unless such increase applies equally to all partner categories any increase in the holdback percentage for any partner shall apply only to distributions relating to carried interest made after the date of such increase the foregoing shall in no way prevent the general partner from proportionately increasing the holdback percentage of any partner category following a reduction of the holdback percentages below the initial holdback percentages if the resulting holdback percentages are consistent with the above for example if the general partner reduces the holdback percentages for existing partners retaining withdrawn partners and deceased partners to   and  respectively the general partner shall have the right to subsequently increase the holdback percentages to the initial holdback percentages iv a notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the partnership may increase or decrease the holdback percentage for any partner in any partner category in such capacity the “ subject partner ” pursuant to a majority vote of the special

the general partner shall not be increased or decreased without its prior written consent provided further  that a subject partner’s holdback percentage shall not be i increased prior to such time as such subject partner x is notified by the partnership of the decision to increase such subject partner’s holdback percentage and y has if requested by such subject partner been given  days to gather and provide information to the partnership for consideration before a second holdback vote requested by the subject partner and ii decreased unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a subject partner’s holdback percentage pursuant to a holdback vote under this clause iv provided further  that such decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such subject partner’s holdback percentage is less than the prevailing holdback percentage for such subject partner’s partner category provided further  that a partner or a special limited partner of bre associates shall not vote to increase a subject partner’s holdback percentage unless such voting partner determines in his good faith judgment that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such subject partner or any of his successors or assigns including his estate or heirs who at the time of such vote holds the partnership interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto will not be capable of satisfying any recontribution amounts that may become due     b a holdback vote shall take place at a partnership meeting which shall also include the special limited partners of bre associates each special limited partner or special limited partner of bre associates shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to the holdback vote regardless of such special limited partner’s interest in the partnership or special limited partner of bre associates’ interest in bre associates as the case may be such vote may be cast by any such special limited partner or special limited partner in person or by proxy     c if the result of the second holdback vote is an increase in a subject partner’s holdback percentage such subject partner may submit the decision to an arbitrator the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both the subject partner and the partnership provided  that if the partnership and the subject partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator        within  days of the second holdback vote each of the partnership and the subject partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates provided further  that if such candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within  days of such request the then sitting president of the american arbitration association shall unilaterally select the arbitrator each subject partner that submits the decision of the partnership pursuant to the second holdback vote to arbitration and the partnership shall estimate their reasonably projected outofpocket expenses relating thereto and each such party shall to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator pay the total of such estimated expenses ie both the subject partner’s and the partnership’s expenses into an escrow account to be controlled by simpson thacher  bartlett llp as escrow agent or such other comparable law firm as the partnership and subject partner shall agree the arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration including costs leading thereto and to return to the “victorious” party the entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account if the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration such “losing” party shall then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such “victorious” party for purposes hereof the “victorious” party shall be the partnership if the holdback percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second holdback vote than it is to the prevailing holdback percentage for the subject partner’s partner category otherwise the subject partner shall be the “victorious” party the party that is not the “victorious” party shall be the “losing” party     d in the event of a decrease in a subject partner’s holdback percentage  pursuant to a holdback vote under this clause iv or  pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph c of this clause iv the partnership shall release and distribute to such subject partner any trust amounts and the trust income thereon except as expressly provided herein with respect to using trust income as firm collateral which exceed the required holdback of such subject partner in accordance with such subject partner’s reduced holdback percentage as though

priority basis except as provided below all or any portion of his firm collateral in satisfaction of his excess holdback obligation any partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the excess holdback utilizing firm collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of the general partner to perfect a first

partnership a second priority security interest therein in the manner provided above provided further  that x to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second priority security interest in pledgable blackstone interests is available or y if the general partner otherwise determines in its good faith judgment that a security interest in firm collateral and the corresponding documents and
