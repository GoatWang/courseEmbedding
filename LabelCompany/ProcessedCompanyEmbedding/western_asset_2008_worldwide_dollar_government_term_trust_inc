dear shareholder   economic growth in the us was mixed during the month reporting period ended july   looking back third quarter  us gross domestic product gdpi growth was a very strong  however continued weakness in the housing market an ongoing credit crunch and soaring oil and food prices then took their toll on the economy as fourth quarter  gdp declined  the economy then expanded  during the first quarter of  and the preliminary estimate for second quarter gdp growth was  in recent months the economy was supported by strong exports and consumer spending the latter of which was aided by the governments tax rebate checks   while the economy may not fall into a recession it is a moot point for many americans as the job market continues to weaken and energy and food prices remain elevated in terms of the employment picture the us department of labor reported that payroll employment declined in each of the first seven months of  and the unemployment rate rose to  in july its highest level since march  after oil reached a record  a barrel on july   it fell to  as of july   which represented an approximate  increase from the price as of july     ongoing issues related to the housing and subprime mortgage markets and seizing credit markets prompted the federal reserve board fedii to take aggressive and in some cases unprecedented actions beginning in september  the fed reduced the federal funds rateiii from  to  this marked the first such reduction since june  the fed then reduced the federal funds rate on six additional occasions through april  bringing the federal funds rate to  the fed then shifted gears in the face of mounting inflationary prices and a weakening us dollar at its latest meetings that took place in june and august after the reporting period ended the fed held rates steady in conjunction with its august meeting the fed stated economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress  inflation has been high spurred by the earlier   western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc     i     letter from the chairman continued   increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain   in addition to the interest rate cuts the fed took several actions to improve liquidity in the credit markets in march  the fed established a new lending program allowing certain brokerage firms known as primary dealers to also borrow from its discount window the fed also increased the maximum term for discount window loans from  to  days then in mid march the fed played a major role in facilitating the purchase of bear stearns by jpmorgan chase   during the month reporting period ended july   both short and longterm treasury yields experienced periods of extreme volatility investors were initially focused on the subprime segment of the mortgage backed market these concerns broadened however to include a wide range of financial institutions and markets as a result other fixedincome instruments also experienced increased price volatility this turmoil triggered several flights to quality causing treasury yields to move lower and their prices higher while riskier segments of the market saw their yields move higher and their prices lower treasury yields then rose in april may and early june  as oil prices hit record levels however an additional credit crunch in midjune resulted in another flight to quality with treasury yields again moving lower overall during the  months ended july   twoyear treasury yields fell from  to  over the same time frame year treasury yields moved from  to  looking at the month period as a whole the overall bond market as measured by the lehman brothers us aggregate indexiv returned    periods of increased investor risk aversion caused the highyield bond market to produce weak results over the  months ended july   during that period the citigroup high yield market indexv returned  while highyield bond prices rallied on several occasions it was not enough to overcome several flights to quality that served to drag down the sector   despite periods of increased investor risk aversion the emerging debt markets posted a positive return over the  months ended july   during that period the jpmorgan emerging markets bond index global embi globalvi returned  overall solid demand an expanding global economy increased domestic spending and the feds numerous rate cuts supported the emerging market

investment strategy   a the funds investment objective is to manage a portfolio of fixedincome securities so as to return  per share the initial public offering price per share to investors on or about november   while providing high monthly income   western asset management company western asset the funds subadviser utilizes a fixedincome team approach with decisions derived from interaction among various investment management sector specialists the sector teams are comprised of western assets senior portfolio managers research analysts and an inhouse economist under this team approach management of client fixedincome portfolios will reflect a consensus of interdisciplinary views within the western asset organization   q what were the overall market conditions during the funds reporting period   a during the fiscal year the us bond market experienced periods of increased volatility changing perceptions regarding the economy inflation and future federal reserve board fedi monetary policy caused bond prices to fluctuate two and year treasury yields began the reporting period at  and  respectively treasury yields then moved lower and their prices moved higheras concerns regarding the subprime mortgage market and a severe credit crunch triggered a massive flight to quality investors were drawn to the relative safety of treasuries while increased investor risk aversion caused other segments of the bond market to falter   as conditions in the credit market worsened in august  central banks around the world took action by injecting approximately  billion of liquidity into the financial system additionally the fed began lowering the federal funds rateii in september  while this initially helped ease the credit crunch continued subprime mortgage writeoffs and weak economic data triggered additional flights to quality in november  and the first quarter of    treasury yields then moved higher in april may and early june as inflationary pressures increased over this period riskier fixedincome asset classes such as highyield bonds and emerging market debt rallied however the credit crunch resumed in midjune  resulting in another flight to quality with treasury yields moving lower yields were then relatively stable in july   western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc         fund overview continued   as of july   two and year treasury yields were  and  respectively while the fed attempted to stimulate growth by cutting short term interest rates from  to  from september  through april  it held rates steady at its meetings in june and august   q how did we respond to these changing market conditions   a market conditions were challenging in the month reporting period which affected the funds performance many asset prices remained well below what we believe to be their fundamental values as a result of market fears and we underestimated the degree to which the entire financial superstructure would decline despite the difficult market environment we believed that our focus on spread sectors such as emerging markets agency passthrough mortgages and corporate bonds was still valid   performance

   western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc     q what were the leading contributors to performance   a the funds allocation to agency mortgagebacked securities contributed to performance issue selection of emerging market debt also contributed to performance as certain issues such as polish and russian us dollar denominated sovereign debt performed better than the benchmark   q what were the leading detractors from performance   a market volatility over the reporting period increased sharply as the subprime mortgage market fallout persisted the funds use of derivatives which were employed to hedge durationvi and yield curvevii exposure detracted from performance the funds exposure to investment grade credit detracted from performance as spreads widened relative to the benchmark the funds underweight to emerging market debt also detracted from performance during the fiscal year the emerging market sector performed well due to strong local economic fundamentals and country ratings upgrades   q were there any significant changes to the fund during the reporting period   a in anticipation of the funds liquidation on or about november   we reduced its exposure to both the emerging market debt and mortgage sectors we slowly increased its allocation to cash and decreased the overall portfolio duration   looking for additional information   the

act of  as amended the  act the investment objective of the fund is to manage a portfolio of fixed income securities so as to return  per share to investors on or about november   while providing high monthly income no assurance can be given that the funds investment objective will be achieved   in accordance with the funds charter documents and approval by its board of directors the fund intends to liquidate on or about november   accounting rules require that financial statements for entities in liquidation or for which liquidation appears imminent be prepared on a liquidation basis of accounting as us generally accepted accounting principles gaap for investment companies are materially consistent with the liquidation basis of accounting the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap for investment companies   the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all at least  of its assets under normal conditions in securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities securities issued or guaranteed by foreign governments sovereign bonds and collateralized in full as to principal due at their maturity by us government securities and zerocoupon obligations of municipal issuers the market prices of the securities in which the fund invests are expected to fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the perceived credit quality of such assets the funds investments in sovereign bonds may be affected by political social economic or diplomatic changes in such countries and the funds investment in such securities increases the risk that the fund will return less than  per share in the year  in addition the funds investment in mortgagebacked securities is subject to the risk that rapid principal repayment including prepayment may have an adverse effect on the yield to maturity of such securities   the following are significant accounting policies consistently followed by the fund and are in conformity with gaap estimates and assumptions are required to be made regarding assets liabilities and changes in net assets resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared changes in the economic environment financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ   a investment valuation debt securities are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices provided by an independent pricing service that are based on transactions in debt obligations quotations from bond dealers market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities equity securities for which market quotations are available are valued at the last sale price or official closing price on the primary market or   western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc  annual report        notes to financial statements continued   exchange on which they trade publicly traded foreign government debt securities are typically traded internationally in the overthecounter market and are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices as of the close of business of that market when prices are not readily available or are determined not to reflect fair value such as when the value of a security has been significantly affected by events after the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded but before the fund calculates its net asset value the fund may value these investments at fair value as determined in accordance with the procedures approved by the funds board of directors shortterm obligations with maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value   b repurchase agreements when entering into repurchase agreements it is the funds policy that its custodian or a third party custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities the market value of which at all times at least equals the principal amount of the repurchase transaction including accrued interest to the extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day the value of the collateral is markedtomarket to ensure the adequacy of the collateral if the seller defaults and the market value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller of the security realization of the collateral by the fund may be delayed or limited   c financial futures contracts the fund may enter into financial futures contracts typically to hedge a portion of the portfolio upon entering into a financial futures contract the fund is required to deposit cash or securities as initial margin equal in value to a certain percentage of the contract amount initial margin deposit additional securities are also segregated up to the current market value of the financial futures contracts subsequent payments known as variation margin are made or received by the fund each day depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying financial instruments for foreign currency denominated futures contracts variation margins are not settled daily the fund recognizes an unrealized gain or loss equal to the fluctuation in the value when the financial futures contracts are closed a realized gain or loss is recognized equal to the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transactions and the funds basis in the contracts   the risks associated with entering into financial futures contracts include the possibility that a change in the value of the contract may not correlate with the changes in the value of the underlying financial instruments in addition investing in financial futures contracts involves the risk that the fund could lose more than the initial margin deposit and subsequent payments required for a futures transaction risks may also arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts      western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc  annual report     d securities traded on a tobeannounced basis the fund may trade securities on a tobeannounced tba basis in a tba transaction the fund commits to purchasing or selling securities which have not yet been issued by the issuer and for which specific information is not known such as the face amount and maturity date and the underlying pool of investments in us government agency mortgage passthrough securities securities purchased on a tba basis are not settled until they are delivered to the fund normally  to  days after purchase beginning on the date the fund enters into a tba transaction cash us government securities or other liquid highgrade debt obligations are segregated in an amount equal in value to the purchase price of the tba security these securities are subject to market fluctuations and their current value is determined in the same manner as for other securities   e stripped securities the fund invests in stripped securities a term used collectively for stripped fixed income securities stripped securities can be principal only securities po which are debt obligations that have been stripped of unmatured interest coupons or interest only securities io which are unmatured interest coupons that have been stripped from debt obligations as is the case with all securities the market value of stripped securities will fluctuate in response to changes in economic conditions interest rates and the markets perception of the securities however fluctuations in response to interest rates may be greater in stripped securities than for debt obligations of comparable maturities that pay interest currently the amount of fluctuation increases with a longer period of maturity   the yield to maturity on ios is sensitive to the rate of principal repayments including prepayments on the related underlying debt obligation and principal payments may have a material effect on yield to maturity if the underlying debt obligation experiences greater than anticipated prepayments of principal the fund may not fully recoup its initial investment in ios   f written options when the fund writes an option an amount equal to the premium received by the fund is recorded as a liability the value of which is markedtomarket daily to reflect the current market value of the option written if the option expires the fund realizes a gain from investments equal to the amount of the premium received when a written call option is exercised the difference between the premium received plus the option exercise price and the funds basis in the underlying security in the case of a covered written call option or the cost to purchase the underlying security in the case of an uncovered written call option including brokerage commission is treated as a realized gain or loss when a written put option is exercised the amount of the premium received is added to the cost of the security purchased by the fund from the exercise of the written put option to form the funds basis in the underlying security purchased the writer or buyer of an option traded on an exchange can liquidate the position before the exercise of the option by entering into a closing transaction the cost of a closing transaction is deducted from the original premium received resulting in a realized gain or loss to the fund   western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc  annual report            notes to financial statements continued   the risk in writing a covered call option is that the fund may forego the opportunity of profit if the market price of the underlying security increases and the option is exercised the risk in writing a put option is that the fund may incur a loss if the market price of the underlying security decreases and the option is exercised the risk in writing a call option is that the fund is exposed to the risk of loss if the market price of the underlying security increases in addition there is the risk that the fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market   g mortgage dollar rolls the fund may enter into dollar rolls in which the fund sells mortgagebacked securities for delivery in the current month realizing a gain or loss and simultaneously contracts to repurchase substantially similar same type coupon and maturity securities to settle on a specified future date during the roll period the fund forgoes interest paid on the securities the fund is compensated by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the initial sale and by the lower repurchase price at the specified future date the fund maintains a segregated account the dollar value of which is at least equal to its obligations with respect to dollar rolls   the fund executes its mortgage dollar rolls entirely in the tba market where the fund makes a forward commitment to purchase a security and instead of accepting delivery the position is offset by a sale of the security with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase at a future date   the risk of entering into a mortgage dollar roll is that the market value of the securities the fund is obligated to repurchase under the agreement may decline below the repurchase price in the event the buyer of securities under a mortgage dollar roll files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent the funds use of proceeds of the dollar roll may be restricted pending a determination by the other party or its trustee or receiver whether to enforce the funds obligation to repurchase the securities   h credit default swaps the fund may enter into credit default swap cds contracts for investment purposes to manage its credit risk or to add leverage cds agreements involve one party making a stream of payments to another party in exchange for the right to receive a specified return in the event of a default by a third party typically corporate issuers or sovereign issuers of an emerging country on a specified obligation the fund may use a cds to provide a measure of protection against defaults of the issuers ie to reduce risk where a fund has exposure to the sovereign issuer or to take an active long or short position with respect to the likelihood of a particular issuers default as a seller of protection the fund generally receives an upfront payment or a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the swap provided that there is no credit event if the fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs as defined under the terms of that particular swap agreement the fund will pay to the buyer of the protection an amount up to the notional value of the swap and in certain instances take delivery of the security as the seller the fund would effectively add leverage to its portfolio because in addition to its total net assets the fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap as a buyer of protection the fund generally receives an amount up to the notional value of the swap if a credit event occurs      western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc  annual report     payments received or made at the beginning of the measurement period are reflected as such on the statement of assets and liabilities these upfront payments are recorded as realized gain or loss on the statement of operations and are amortized over the life of the swap a liquidation payment received or made at the termination of the swap is recorded as realized gain or loss on the statement of operations   entering into a cds swaps involves to varying degrees elements of credit market and documentation risk in excess of the related amounts recognized on the statement of assets and liabilities such risks involve the possibility that there will be no liquid market for these agreements that the counterparty to the agreements may default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the contractual terms in the agreement and that there will be unfavorable changes in net interest rates   i swaptions the fund may write swaption contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to enhance portfolio yield swaption contracts written by the fund represent an option that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to enter into a previously agreed upon swap contract on a future date if a written call swaption is exercised the writer enters a swap and is obligated to pay the fixed rate and receive a floating rate in exchange if a written put swaption is exercised the writer enters a swap and is obligated to pay the floating rate and receive a fixed rate in exchange swaptions are markedtomarket daily based upon quotations from market makers   when the fund writes a swaption an amount equal to the premium received by the fund is recorded as a liability the value of which is markedtomarket daily to reflect the current market value of the swaption written changes in the value of the swaption are reported as unrealized gains or losses in the statements of operations if the swaption expires the fund realizes a gain equal to the amount of the premium received when a written swaption is exercised the premium received is added to the basis of the swap agreement entered   entering into a swaption contract involves to varying degrees the elements of credit market and interest rate risk associated with both option contracts and swap contracts to reduce credit risk from potential counterparty default the fund enters into swaption contracts with counterparties whose creditworthiness has been evaluated by the investment manager the fund bears the market risk arising from any change in index values or interest rates   j credit and market risk the fund invests in high yield and emerging market instruments that are subject to certain credit and market risks the yields of high yield and emerging market debt obligations reflect among other things perceived credit and market risks the funds investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks not associated with higher rated securities including among others greater risk related to timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal greater market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading the consequences of political social economic or   western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc  annual report        notes to financial statements continued   diplomatic changes may have disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the fund the funds investment in nondollar denominated securities may also result in foreign currency losses caused by devaluations and exchange rate fluctuations   investments in securities such as those issued by structured investment vehicles or sivs which are collateralized by residential real estate mortgages are subject to certain credit and liquidity risks when market conditions result in an increase in default rates of the underlying mortgages and the foreclosure values of underlying real estate properties are materially below the outstanding amount of these underlying mortgages collection of the full amount of accrued interest and principal on these investments may be doubtful such market conditions may significantly impair the value of these investments resulting in a lack of correlation between their credit ratings and values   k other risks consistent with its objective to seek high current income the fund may invest in instruments whose values and interest rates are linked to foreign currencies interest rates indices or some other financial indicator the value at maturity or interest rates for these instruments will increase or decrease according to the change in the indicator to which they are indexed these securities are generally more volatile in nature and the risk of loss of principal is greater   l security transactions and investment income security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis interest income adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount is recorded on the accrual basis dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date the cost of investments sold is determined by use of the specific identification method to the extent any issuer defaults on an expected interest payment the funds policy is to generally halt any additional interest income accruals and consider the realizability of interest accrued up to the date of default   m distributions to shareholders distributions from net investment income for the fund if any are declared and paid on a monthly basis distributions of net realized gains if any are declared at least annually distributions are recorded on the exdividend date and are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from gaap   n federal and other taxes it is the funds policy to comply with the federal income and excise tax requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended applicable to regulated investment companies accordingly the fund intends to distribute substantially all of its taxable income and net realized gains if any to shareholders each year therefore no federal income tax provision is required in the funds financial statements   management has analyzed the funds tax positions taken on federal income tax returns for all open tax years and has concluded that as of july   no provision for income tax would be required in the funds financial statements      western asset  worldwide dollar government term trust inc  annual report     the funds federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and state departments of revenue   o reclassification gaap requires that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent differences between financial and tax reporting these reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset values per share during the current year the following reclassifications have been made     undistributed net accumulated net     investment income realized gain   a       a reclassifications are primarily due to differences between book and tax amortization of premium on fixed income securities income from mortgage backed securities treated as capital gains for tax purposes and booktax differences in the treatment of swap contracts    investment management agreement and other transactions with affiliates   legg mason partners fund advisor llc lmpfa is the

such as the inability of the subadviser to provide investment advisory services lmpfa shall utilize the proxy voting guidelines established by the most recent subadviser to vote proxies until a new

information regarding how each fund voted proxies if any relating to portfolio securities during the most recent month period ended june  is available without charge  by calling   on the funds website at httpwwwleggmasoncomindividualinvestors  and  on the secs website at httpwwwsecgov   background   western asset management company wa and western asset management company limited waml together western asset have adopted and implemented policies and procedures that we believe are reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interest of clients in accordance with our fiduciary duties and sec rule  under the investment advisers act of  advisers act our authority to vote the proxies of our clients is established through investment management agreements or comparable documents and our proxy voting guidelines have been tailored to reflect these specific contractual obligations in addition to sec requirements governing advisers our proxy voting policies reflect the longstanding fiduciary standards and responsibilities for erisa accounts unless a manager of erisa assets has been expressly precluded from voting proxies the department of labor has determined that the responsibility for these votes lies with the investment manager   in exercising its voting authority western asset will not consult or enter into agreements with officers directors or employees of legg mason inc or any of its affiliates except that wa and waml may so consult and agree with each other regarding the voting of any securities owned by its clients     policy   western assets proxy voting procedures are designed and implemented in a way that is reasonably expected to ensure that proxy matters are handled in the best interest of our clients while the guidelines included in the procedures are intended to provide a benchmark for voting standards each vote is ultimately cast on a casebycase basis taking into consideration western assets contractual obligations to our clients and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote such that these guidelines may be overridden to the extent western asset deems appropriate   procedures   responsibility and oversight   the western asset compliance department compliance department is responsible for administering and overseeing the proxy voting process the gathering of proxies is coordinated through the corporate actions area of investment support corporate actions research analysts and portfolio managers are responsible for determining appropriate voting positions on each proxy utilizing any applicable guidelines contained in these procedures   client authority   prior to august   all existing client investment management agreements imas will be reviewed to determine whether western asset has authority to vote client proxies at account startup or upon amendment of an ima the applicable client ima are similarly reviewed if an agreement is silent on proxy voting but contains an overall delegation of discretionary authority or if the account represents assets of an erisa plan western asset will assume responsibility for proxy voting the client account transition team maintains a matrix of proxy voting authority   proxy gathering   registered owners of record client custodians client banks and trustees proxy recipients that receive proxy materials on behalf of clients should forward them to corporate actions prior to august   proxy recipients of existing clients will be reminded of the appropriate routing to corporate actions for proxy materials received and reminded of their responsibility to forward all proxy materials on a timely basis proxy recipients for new clients or if western asset becomes aware that the applicable proxy recipient for an existing client has changed the proxy recipient for the existing client are notified at startup of appropriate routing to corporate actions of proxy materials received and reminded of their responsibility to forward all proxy materials on a timely basis if western asset personnel other than corporate actions receive proxy materials they should promptly forward the materials to corporate actions   proxy voting   once proxy materials are received by corporate actions they are forwarded to the compliance department for coordination and the following actions   a proxies are reviewed to determine accounts impacted   b impacted accounts are checked to confirm western asset voting authority   c compliance department staff reviews proxy issues to determine any material conflicts of interest see conflicts of interest section of these procedures for further information on determining material conflicts of interest     d if a material conflict of interest exists i to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable law the client is promptly notified the conflict is disclosed and western asset obtains the clients proxy voting instructions and ii to the extent that it is not reasonably practicable or permitted by applicable law to notify the client and obtain such instructions eg the client is a mutual fund or other commingled vehicle or is an erisa plan client western asset seeks voting instructions from an independent third party   e compliance department staff provides proxy material to the appropriate research analyst or portfolio manager to obtain their recommended vote research analysts and portfolio managers determine votes on a casebycase basis taking into account the voting guidelines contained in these procedures for avoidance of doubt depending on the best interest of each individual client western asset may vote the same proxy differently for different clients the analysts or portfolio managers basis for their decision is documented and maintained by the compliance department   f compliance department staff votes the proxy pursuant to the instructions received in d or e and returns the voted proxy as indicated in the proxy materials   timing   western asset personnel act in such a manner to ensure that absent special circumstances the proxy gathering and proxy

portfolios managed by employees of western asset management company western asset  mr leech and mr walsh are involved in the management of all the firms portfolios but they are not solely responsible for particular portfolios  western assets investment discipline emphasizes a team approach that combines the efforts of groups of specialists working in different market sectors they are responsible for overseeing implementation of western assets overall investment ideas and coordinating the work of the various sector teams this structure ensures that client portfolios benefit from a consensus that draws on the expertise of all team members   a portfolio manager compensation  with respect to the compensation of the portfolio managers the advisers compensation system assigns each employee a total compensation target and a respective cap which are derived from annual market surveys that benchmark each role with their job function and peer universe  this method is designed to reward employees with total compensation reflective of the external market value of their skills experience and ability to produce desired results   standard compensation includes competitive base salaries generous employee benefits and a retirement plan   in addition employees are eligible for bonuses  these are structured to closely align the interests of employees with those of the advisers and are determined by the professionals job function and performance as measured by a formal review process  all bonuses are completely discretionary  one of the principal factors considered is a portfolio managers investment performance versus appropriate peer groups and benchmarks  performance is reviewed on a   and  year basis for compensation  with  years having the most emphasis because portfolio managers are generally responsible for multiple accounts including the portfolio with similar investment strategies they are compensated on the performance of the aggregate group of similar accounts rather than a specific account though relative performance against the stated benchmark and its applicable lipper peer group is considered  a smaller portion of a bonus payment is derived from factors that include client service business development length of service to the adviser management or supervisory responsibilities contributions to developing business strategy and overall contributions to the advisers business   finally in order to attract and retain top talent all professionals are eligible for additional incentives in recognition of outstanding performance  these are determined based upon the factors described above and include legg mason inc stock options and longterm incentives that vest over a set period of time past the award date     potential conflicts of interest   potential conflicts of interest may arise in connection with the management of multiple accounts including accounts managed in a personal capacity  these could include potential conflicts of interest related to the knowledge and timing of a portfolios trades investment opportunities and broker selection  portfolio managers may be privy to the size timing and possible market impact of a portfolios trades   it is possible that an investment opportunity may be suitable for both a portfolio and other accounts managed by a portfolio manager but may not be available in sufficient quantities for both the portfolio and the other accounts to participate fully  similarly there may be limited opportunity to sell an investment held by a portfolio and another account  a conflict may arise where the portfolio manager may have an incentive to treat an account preferentially as compared to a portfolio because the account pays a performancebased fee or the portfolio manager the advisers or an affiliate has an interest in the account  the advisers have adopted procedures for allocation of portfolio transactions and investment opportunities across multiple client accounts on a fair and equitable basis over time  all eligible accounts that can participate in a trade share the same price on a prorata allocation basis in an attempt to mitigate any conflict of interest  trades are allocated among similarly managed accounts to maintain consistency of portfolio strategy taking into account cash availability investment restrictions and guidelines and portfolio composition versus strategy   with respect to securities transactions for the portfolios the advisers determine which broker or dealer to use to execute each order consistent with their duty to seek best execution of the transaction  however with respect to certain other accounts such as pooled investment vehicles that are not registered investment companies and other accounts managed for organizations and individuals the advisers may be limited by the client with respect to the selection of brokers or dealers or may be instructed to direct trades through a particular broker or dealer  in these cases trades for a portfolio in a particular security may be placed separately from rather than aggregated with such other accounts  having separate transactions with respect to a security may temporarily affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the possible detriment of a portfolio or the other accounts involved  additionally the management of multiple portfolios andor other accounts may result in a portfolio manager devoting unequal time and attention to the management of each portfolio andor other account   it is theoretically possible that portfolio managers could use information to the advantage of other accounts they manage and to the possible detriment of a portfolio  for example a portfolio manager could short sell a security for an account immediately prior to a portfolios sale of that security  to address this conflict the advisers have adopted procedures for reviewing and comparing selected trades of alternative investment accounts which may make directional trades such as short sales with long only accounts which include the portfolios for timing and pattern related issues  trading decisions for alternative investment and long only accounts may not be identical even though the same portfolio manager may manage both types of accounts  whether the adviser allocates a particular investment opportunity to only alternative investment accounts or to alternative investment and long only accounts will depend on the investment strategy being implemented  if under the circumstances an investment opportunity is appropriate for both its alternative investment and long only accounts then it will be allocated to both on a prorata basis   a portfolio manager may also face other potential conflicts of interest in managing a portfolio and the description above is not a complete description of every conflict of interest that could be deemed to exist in managing both a portfolio and the other accounts listed above     a portfolio manager securities ownership  the table below identifies the dollar range of securities beneficially owned by each portfolio managers as of july     portfolio managers   dollar
