statements by terminology such as may should could would expect plan anticipate believe estimate continue or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include but are not limited to those described under risk factors in our form k for the fiscal year ended april   as filed on july   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report overview lvyuan green building material technology corp the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on january   as green supplements online inc we changed to our present name on september   our principal executive offices are located at room  f kerry center no  renmin south road luohu district shenzhen city guangdong peoples republic of china our phone number is  our business model was to buy nutrition and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our private label our source of revenue from operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products the line of nutrition and dietary products that we intended to market was to be standard nonproprietary supplements and other products that contained our label currently we have not yet initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date the company is seeking to acquire through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified operating expenses during the quarters ended january   and  we have incurred  and  in expenses respectively including fees paid to the companys independent accounting firm associated with the sec filings during the nine months ended january   and  we have incurred  and  in expenses respectively including fees paid to the companys independent accounting firm associated with the sec filings going concern the company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to  filing of exchange act reports as of january   the company has an accumulated deficit of  management anticipates that fees associated with the filing of exchange act reports including accounting fees legal fees and the payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed  during the next  months we do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a finder to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including but not limited to our affiliates lenders investment banking firms private equity funds consultants and attorneys and does not plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity management decisions therefore will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies independent analysis market surveys and the like which if we had more funds would be desirable if management can find a suitable target company we will have to budget for additional fees relating to the investigation into the target company including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities and consummating the reverse merger which may cost between  to  we expect that the expenses for the next  months and beyond will be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors since we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the exchange act we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination  table of contents currently our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company managements plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available the company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not

prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america “us gaap” related to development stage companies a developmentstage company is one in which planned principal operations have not commenced or if its operations have commenced there has been no significant revenues therefrom     b basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the company in accordance with us gaap and rule  of regulation sx promulgated by the securities and exchange commission “sec” accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap the condensed statements of operations for the three months ended july   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim period these unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended april   in the opinion of management all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented have been reflected in such condensed financial statements   the company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes the financial statements and notes are representations of management accounting policies adopted by the company conform to us gaap and have been consistently applied in the presentation of financial statements the accompanying financial statements are presented in us dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec     c net loss per common share   the company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of fasb asc  “earnings per share” net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period at july   and  the company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could potentially be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the company as a result diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the period     d use of estimates   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those estimates     e recently issued or adopted standards   the company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flow            lvyuan green building material technology corp   notes to condensed financial statements unaudited    income taxes   as of july   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately that may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income in varying amounts through  future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carryforwards   due to the change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years    going concern and capital resources   the company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to     ● filing of exchange act reports   ● transfer agent services   ● payment of annual corporate fees and   ● investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   as of july   the company had an accumulated deficit of  management anticipates that fees associated with filing of exchange act reports including accounting fees and legal fees and payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed  within the next  months we do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including but not limited to our affiliates lenders investment banking firms private equity funds consultants and attorneys and does not plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity management decisions therefore will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies independent analysis market surveys and the like which if we had more funds would be desirable if the management can find a suitable target company we will have to budget for additional fees relating to the investigation into the target company including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities and consummating the reverse merger which may cost between  to  we expect that the expenses for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors since we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the exchange act we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination    loans from officers and directors   as of july   the company had received loans from its officers and directors aggregating  the loans are noninterest bearing and contain no specific repayment terms             item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   this quarterly report on form q includes forwardlooking statements we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events these forwardlooking statements are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as “may” “should” “could” “would” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “continue” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include but are not limited to those described under “risk factors” in our form k for the fiscal year ended april   as filed on july   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report   overview   lvyuan green building material technology corp the “company” was incorporated in the state of nevada on january   as green supplements online inc we changed to our present name on september   our principal executive offices are located at room  f kerry center no  renmin south road luohu district shenzhen city guangdong people’s republic of china our phone number is    our business model was to buy nutrition and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our privatelabel our source of revenue from operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products the line of nutrition and dietary products that we intended to market was to be standard nonproprietary supplements and other products that contained our label currently we have not yet initiated any product

following the change of control the company is now seeking to acquire through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization exchangeable share transaction or other

activities that provide cash flow during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to     ● filing of exchange act reports   ● payment of annual corporate fees and   ● investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   as of july   the company has an accumulated deficit of  management anticipates that fees associated with the filing of exchange act reports including

since we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the exchange act we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination   currently our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available   the company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may affect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks   our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization   the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky our potential merger targets are firms seeking either the benefits of a business combination with an sec reporting company andor the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock while a private operating company may achieve the same benefits by filing its own exchange act registration statement such benefits can be achieved at a potentially faster rate with limited regulatory review through the completion of a business combination with a public reporting company a potentially available business combination may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty            in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours there are numerous blank check companies that have gone public in the united states that have significant financial resources that are seeking to carry out a business plan similar to our business plan many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors   liquidity and capital resources   as of july   our total assets were  and our total liabilities were  comprised of notes payable to related parties   stockholders’ equity decreased from  as of april   to  as of july      cash flows from operating activities   we have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended july   net cash flows used in operating activities were  consisting of a net loss   cash flows from financing activities   we have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments for the three months ended july   net cash from financing activities was and  respectively consisting of loans from directors    we suffered recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of  as of july   currently we are a nonoperating public company we currently are seeking to acquire through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified in the event we use all of our cash resources certain members of management and shareholders have indicated their willingness to loan us funds at the prevailing market rate assuming we find a suitable candidate for an acquisition until such acquisition is consummated even though this is their current intention they have made no firm commitment and it is at their sole discretion whether or not to fund us in the event they do not fund us and we are not able to find outside investors we will not have the funds necessary to operate and will have to dissolve
