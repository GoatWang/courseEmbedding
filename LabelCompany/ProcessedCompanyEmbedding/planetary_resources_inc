enticing destinations they become asteroids are primordial material left over from the formation of the solar system they are scattered throughout it some pass close to the sun and others are found out beyond the orbit of neptune a vast majority have been collected by jupiter’s gravity into a belt between it and mars – an area known as the main belt as it turns out astronomers have been discovering thousands of asteroids that do not belong to the main belt but instead pass near earth’s orbit – more than  to date with over a thousand more discovered every year outside of low earth orbit many near earth asteroids are the most accessible destination in the universe many also contain enormous quantities of accessible resources we have learned a great deal about asteroids over the past few decades from the  meteorite samples that have been analyzed in laboratories the modern investments in telescopic study and from successful government space missions to  eros  itokawa  vesta and other asteroids you can learn more about “how we know so much about asteroids” in this blog post types of asteroids there are three general types of asteroids in our solar system planetary resources is targeting asteroid types that are rich in water ctype or rich in precious metals xtype as they offer the most value and will positively affect growth of the space economy review our list of interesting astroid targets in the solar system ctype asteroids are very dark in color and may be the most common they closely follow the elemental composition of the sun which leads scientists to conclude that ctype asteroids are very primitive objects formed at the dawn of the solar system planetary resources will mine water from the ctype asteroids photo credit laurence garvie center for meteorite studies asuxtype asteroids are composed of primarily metal they appear to be the remnants of large   km asteroids that fully separated into a core and mantle some of the these large asteroids were pulverized in massive collisions early in the solar system’s history leaving only the tough metallic cores they have today they are known for being extremely dense unlike any metallic ore bodies we find on earth today one of planetary resources targets is an xtype asteroid and may have more platinum than has ever been mined on earth to date photo credit laurence garvie center for meteorite studies asustype asteroids are a mixture of rock and metal mixed together these rocky asteroids dominate the inner portion of the main belt and are often found as nearearth objects scientists believe they are the source of the chondrite meteorites which are the most commonly found meteorite these are composed of material that was heated to melting but never separated from the rock as happened with similar ore bodies on earth photo credit laurence garvie center for meteorite studies asu asteroid prospecting every mine starts with a geologist exploring on horseback  our geologists and horses just happen to be robots asteroid mining activities must be preceded by the development of asteroid prospecting capabilities the ideal prospector craft is capable of rendezvousing with an asteroid surveying the surface for weeks at a time and then landing or impacting to conduct insitu measurements nasa and the japanese space agency had demonstrated these capabilities but required multihundredmilliondollar budgets and time frames of a decade to do so planetary resources is standing on their shoulders to perform commercial prospecting at costs that are more than an order of magnitude lower asteroid analysis with advanced sensors our primary objective during the prospecting phase is to analyze the asteroids composition and characteristics we are doing this with our advanced sensors onboard the arkyd spacecraft that gather data of our asteroid targets this gives us valuable data about the composition that allows us to confirm the targets value beyond the data we have collected from earth based observation arkyd betas the technology demonstrators software programmers release versions and betatest space hardware doesn’t need to be any different with the small size and low cost of our spacecraft hardware planetary resources is using space as our test bed starting in lowearth orbit we are deploying a series of increasingly more capable spacecraft allowing for research and development iteration and testing our first spacecraft in the series of technology demonstrators for prospecting and other exciting technologies are the

the fuel shelter and sustenance of space every frontier expansion and gold rush in history relied on a local source of energy and a transportation backbone  space will be no different  before mining precious metals planetary resources intends to produce fuel in space from carbonaceous chondrites rich in water that can be broken down into highly efficient loxh rocket fuel  rocket fuel is an attractive early resource for several reasons a large market for fuel in space already exists fuel will open the interplanetary equivalent of exploration era trade routes fuel enables other resource mining operations in the future mining in space is different than mining on earth and in some cases may be more simple the actual method used for extracting and refining rocket fuels from asteroids will depend on the specific composition of the target asteroid and will require an upclose investigation with planetary resources’ arkyd prospectors  however the mining equipment required may be more simple than you imagine  in some cases much of the equipment we need to mine on earth drills excavators concentrators may not be required  even surface contact with the asteroid may not be necessary due to the unique environment of space one possible concept for extracting water from an asteroid may be as follows enclose fully enclose a small asteroid or position a cold plate in the vicinity of a large asteroid heat concentrate and direct freelyavailable thermal energy from the sun onto the asteroid  at temperature water will volatilize similar to what occurs naturally with approaching comets  the gaseous water will freeze on contact with the cold plate in a largely preconcentrated form release once the desired quantities are captured release or depart from the asteroid to deliver the fuel to the point of need in earth orbit or elsewhere in the solar system many of the engineering systems required for such a process have already been demonstrated in space  but before they can be deployed to mine asteroids we must first learn which asteroids are rich in water and how that water is locked within the asteroid  without advances in this knowledge the engineering and deployment of waterharvesting spacecraft would be excessively risky mining and delivery we’ve been mining asteroids on earth for centuries  planetary resources is going to the source some of earth’s richest ore deposits such as canada’s sudbury basin can trace their origins to ancient asteroid impacts  by going to the source planetary resources can harvest platinum group metals in much higher concentrations than even the richest earth mines on earth a single platinumrich  meter wide asteroid contains about  times the yearly world output of platinum and  times the known worldreserves of platinum group metals ruthenium rhodium palladium osmium iridium and platinum  this amount is enough to fill a basketball court to four times the height of the rim  by contrast all of the platinum group metals mined to date in history would not reach waisthigh on that same basketball court while platinum group metals are enriched in asteroids to often hundreds of times that of the richest mines on earth they still represent just a small fraction of the total mass of an asteroid  extraction processes could be chemically or energy intensive requiring abundant solar energy fuel working fluids and machinery  an abundant cheap local source of fuel and working fluids are a natural building block towards developing space metal mining capabilities and then delivering those resources back to earth   asteroid

and technology for today’s marketplace as we continue to pursue our mission to utilize valuable resources extracted from nearearth asteroids our mission demands the best our spacecraft are headed into deep space it’s a challenging environment outside earth’s protective magnetosphere where radiation is prevalent and communicating back to earth is minutes away this is where our spacecraft must thrive that’s why kilo for kilo we build the most capable commercial space systems ever designed to prospect the asteroids we need miniaturized sensors that communicate effectively over long distances on an autonomous mobile and resilient platform on the roadmap to developing our prospecting technology our innovations are available to global markets who can gain value from these technologies today spacebased observation specialized systems to prospect asteroids and much more asteroid prospecting requires tools that can determine mineralogy water composition macroporosity and other ore body characteristics our sensors operate over a wide spectral range beyond traditional visible wavelength sensors to achieve these goals combined with arkyd our agile small spacecraft platform these sensors also serve major applications closer to home earth observation and space situational awareness   arkyd our latest iteration of spacecraft includes the firstever commercial mid wavelength infrared sensor for spacebased observations we’ve built two of these spacecraft with launch dates scheduled in  arkyd  attitude determination  control systems planning for the future traditional spacecraft control systems are designed to meet the pointing requirements for a single vehicle with specific mission goals this narrow scope produces an architecture that is unique and rigid driving up development costs and effort for the attitude control system of each new vehicle planetary resources is developing a spacecraft control architecture that is both modular and upgradable right from the beginning  this investment supports the rapid deployment and evolution of our spacecraft as internal and external demands change vertically integrated with spacecraft control you are only as good as your hardware and in some cases the right sensor or actuator for this critical function may not be available or costeffective that’s why we have built a new suite of sensors and actuators right here at planetary resources  these systems can measure a spacecraft rotating at a rate slower than the hour hand of a clock while pointing a beam within the width of a dime one mile away by controlling the design of both the components and the system we can balance capabilities and risks where they are appropriately taken rather than depend on historical vendor decisions and when the time is right to upgrade we control our own path a systemlevel solution to reliability controlling spacecraft attitude is inherently a system level function this has driven us to reimagine how the role of adcs is distributed within a spacecraft we have moved away from a traditional centralized approach in which a single compute element is responsible for the adcs system and have instead adopted the idea of basic instinctual behaviors instincts are a way of commanding and protecting critical spacecraft components locally using an integrated and distributed network of lowlevel hardened compute elements similar to a person instinctively removing their hand from a hot surface the adcs system has builtin instinctual responses that react to protect the system without relying on the central brain low cost avionics  software how did it come to be that your cell phone wields significantly more computing power than nasa’s most complicated most expensive robotic explorers interplanetary space is a challenging environment for spacecraft avionics not only can the thermal vacuum and radiation environments damage electronics the sheer distance from earth drives designers to take conservative approaches to new technology adoption  solutions today often rely on redundant architectures using expensive centralized heritage components specifically designed for operations in deep space this philosophy limits the design team’s ability to benefit from the tremendous advancements in the microelectronics industry leaving them consistently behind the technological curve the mars curiosity rover for instance is controlled by a redundant system that uses a cpu originally developed almost two decades ago at planetary resources we are breaking away from this model instead of an architecture that relies on a single centralized and expensive set of avionics hardware we take a tiered and modular approach to spacecraft avionics in our model a distributed set of commerciallyavailable lowlevel hardened elements each handle local control of a specific spacecraft function this disaggregation of functional responsibility has a number of advantages it is easier to accommodate modern components and cots hardware because we can replace a single component or subsystem without perturbing the rest of the design we can rapidly iterate on spacecraft design because the exact form and configuration of the system can be modified late in a design flow we can reduce system interdependencies as each component has its own independent compute element that coordinates with other parts of the system we can decouple hardware and software through virtualization so that each may advance at their own pace even with this change in architecture the radiation environment of space is still challenging instead of making our system completely “hardened” we make our systems resilient to the effects of radiation by designing the system to allow normal operations to continue despite random reset events on various elements of the architecture  a modular decentralized hardware approach allows for a fault to be contained locally at only the component affected  the ramifications of such an event do not propagate through power data and functional interfaces to the rest of the system space communications interplanetary space can be lonely especially if there is no one to talk to “talking” is a difficult task for any intrepid robotic explorer on its way to near earth asteroids nea as the distance back to earth can exceed  astronomical units aus or nearly  million miles traditional spacecraft use radio frequency or rf communications to solve this problem while proven and reliable rf systems require massive and powerintensive hardware that drive the cost of deepspace probes outside of the constraints of commercial budgets at the same time very large sensitive receivers on earth are necessary to pick up the incredibly faint signals from the spacecraft nasa’s deep space network which includes some of the largest radio telescopes on earth as large as  meters in diameter was specifically designed to communicate with interplanetary probes in this way and it does so everyday providing critical communications for dozens of us government and international spacecraft around the solar system unfortunately this makes for a pretty busy interplanetary network one that is difficult to rely on for commercial operations in deep space fortunately planetary resources has found a solution to this problem in the form of optical communications due to the shorter wavelength of optical communications when compared to rf lasers allow for information to be communicated through a more tightly controlled beam using a significantly smaller aperture this narrower focus greatly reduces the power required for a given communications data rate and distance allowing a small spacecraft to effectively relay scientific and technical data even when it is on the other side of the solar system planetary resources is developing a multifunction main instrument for its arkyd spacecraft platform one that integrates remote imaging optical navigation and optical communications into a single resourceefficient tool the system will take advantage of many of the advancements made in free space optical communications here on earth as well as previous work performed for nasa with mit as a partner on miniaturized stabilization for optical communications on nanosatellites high δv small satellite propulsion systems sending a spacecraft into deep space is an energetically expensive proposition conventionally a spacecraft headed out into the solar system would be placed directly on its outbound trajectory by its own launch vehicle this launch vehicle alone can be a  million proposition or more  we are taking a different path  our arkyd prospecting spacecraft are small enough to hitch a ride into space with larger primary payloads  we launch one at a time into an orbit based on the needs of the rocket’s primary payload this presents a challenge as a rendezvous with a solarorbiting asteroid requires departing earth at a very specific time at a specific speed and in a very specific direction otherwise you could miss your rendezvous by thousands or even millions of kilometers planetary resources solves this problem by being able to make its own way to near earth asteroids directly from the low earth orbit where it is placed as a secondary payload once in orbit the arkyd spacecraft uses its onboard propulsion system and an advantage of the earth’s gravitational influence called the oberth effect to escape earth’s gravity well and head towards a future rendezvous with the nea of interest the arkyd spacecraft also employs two key technologies to enable this scale of propulsive capability on such a small platform first the system uses one of a new family of green nontoxic monopropellants this allows the spacecraft as a secondary payload to be successfully integrated for launch without significant schedule impact or safety risk to the rocket’s primary satellite customer second this propellant is stored and managed within a propulsion system that is directly integrated into the spacecraft’s primary structure working with its strategic investor and partner d systems planetary resources is using additive manufacturing techniques to directly integrate the system’s manifold plenum and routing geometries directly into structural elements that support the spacecraft’s elements during the rigors of launch by doing so a system that conventionally consists of hundreds of parts and countless workmanshipsensitive assembly operations is now simplified down to just a handful of components resulting in a system that is at once lighter cheaper safer and much easier to build again and again contact resourcesplanetaryresourcescom • partner partnershipsplanetaryresourcescom • press

telescope for everyone by planetary resources update  may   final update and full refund  comments  comments like  likes greetings arkyd backers when we announced plans for our crowdfunding campaign “arkyd a space telescope for everyone” the support from the kickstarter community was and still is amazing our goal was lofty and with your support we raised a recordsetting us million in funds to support it thank you so much for the constant encouragement you’ve provided us the support to try out a bold new idea with the potential for huge impact both on and off this planet so far we have fulfilled the many tshirt sticker and poster rewards we’ve provided scores of memberships to the planetary society codes for the video game planetary annihilation and developed an educational rocket science board game in partnership with xtronaut enterprises in addition to these kickstarterfunded activities we’ve also progressed on our company roadmap and built and launched two arkyd test spacecraft the first didn’t make it very far off the ground and our two followon arkyd test satellites are finished and waiting for their next launch into space this summer all this leads to the arkyd  space telescope capability when we closed the campaign in june of  we were confident that the tremendous enthusiasm from around the world would translate into continued financial support outside of the kickstarter community to move our idea forward… but what we discovered was unfortunate aside from all the progress we made in the underlying technology the followon interest from the business and educational sectors to expand the arkyd campaign into a fullysupported mission did not exist as we had anticipated we have explored and exhausted a variety of opportunities big and small for the financial backing necessary to complete the project due to the lack of necessary followon support we are saddened to announce that we are unable to fulfill the “arkyd a space telescope for everyone” campaign while we regret we must winddown the project we are pleased that we can offer each of our  backers an immediate and full refund with our sincere thanks for your longstanding support weve

see that their project is still progressing in a different fashion mm makes a nice interest accruing loan for them and their only repayment of this loan is based on the original note they pocket the interest theyve earned for the past three  years the interest alone from their investment is staggering what a nice deal for them kickstarter should prosecute folks like this or we should what they should be refunding to us is our initial outlay plus any interest they earned during the three years  that they had our money i have invested in several kickstarter projects most of which had significant delays from what was promised and some of the products were a bit iffy but in all other cases ive always received the end product i had planned to use this selfie in space from arkyd with my daughter as a christmas card but now shes in college ridiculous and fraudulent should be prosecuted scott medwid on july   i sent the refund form in a month ago via the link but i have not gotten a check yet or any communication from the company note the day you folks announce the refund to your kickstarter backers you announce a big private equity funder is on board with you so many of us believers learned a lesson my question is this what future idea from an earnest start up is not going to get kickstarted because of this bait and rebate low cost loan scheme of yours darrell thompson on june   apply the money to rd we need that more than i need a refund marc on june   thanks caitlin different browser did the trick my no sleep till orbit tshirt is still one of my favorites and id happily repledge if arkyd ever tries again youve been very generous with your refund policy and your idea was a worthy one jozape on june   this sure is taking a long time should i just try to send a refund request again im not sure how the system on your end works or if its even functioning properly so i dont want to get two refunds from you by accident jozape on june   okay email sent planetary resources creator on june   jozape send me an email and i can look into this for you thanks kickstarterplanetaryresourcescom marc a couple people have had the same thing but we have confirmed our certificate is safe maybe try another browser or network thanks caitlin marc on june   its a shame investors have been so short sighted i tried the refund link but firefox flagged it as an insecure link so was the help link has anyone else met this probllem michael psarouthakis on june   sorry to hear this news and kudos to you for offering refunds what i would suggest is that the company explore equity crowdfunding which just went legal on may th or explore accredited investor crowdfunding like angel list i would really like to put my refunded pledge back to work with your company good luck and keep pushing forward lewis rossjones on june   well thats a shame the first project i ever backed on kickstarter and its a damp squib im not sure i fully understand youre still planning to develop the arkyd  so why back out of this project jozape on june   i have to say that this is a very classy act by planetary resources too bad nobody was as interested as we the backers in funding this i was so interested that i pledged more money in this kickstarter than any other before and after i am not certain that my refund successfully submitted though i just filled out the link sent to my email and after clicking submit i got a mostly blank page with only a planetary resources logo at the top is there supposed be a confirmation that my refund was successfully submitted david rabanus superbacker on june   dear planetaryresources team thanks for the offer of a refund sad to hear that it did not work out as expected as a space selfie would be really something is there a way for you to keep my pledge funds for a particular purpose in your company regards and all the best  david david sheldon on june   i pledged the  three years ago because  thats an amazing deal on a spaceselfie and  i believe in what you are trying to accomplish it saddens me to hear that you werent able to get the followon support that you needed yet i can understand why investors would be wary as for me i wont miss the  and wont be requesting a refund i would rather that this project continues down to the very last penny best of luck to you all  planetary resources creator on june   anton i have responded to you via email let me know if you need anything else thanks caitlin planetary resources creator on june   john c i have reached out to you via email let us know if you still need help my sending us a note at kickstarterplanetaryresourcescom sometimes with gmail accounts the email is going into the promotions tab so you might look there thanks caitlin john christou on june   i never received my refund email link please resend thanks anton kurkin on june   i sent a message to kickstarterplanetaryresourcescom at may th and didnt get a reply yet delay is understandable just want to be sure it wasnt lost david leacy on june   thanks for the memories ive never been so interested in a space program planetary resources creator on june   ronnie i just resent your link to you let me know if you do not get it by emailing me at kickstarterplanetaryresourcescom thanks caitlin w scott meeks superbacker on june   to follow up on ken burwoods thoughts my pledge was small enough for my budget and my interested in your core business keen enough that im okay with letting you keep my contribution is there anyway to indicate that i assume otherwise youll have to follow up with anyone who does not request a refund ken burwood on june   sad to hear it was a great idea im surprised that there wasnt more interest from at least the educational fieldthe educational potential of the arkyd project was the entire reason that i backed it i didnt care about the selfie myself im still contemplating whether ill ask for a refund i dont normally ask for refunds since the couple projects that have failed have been small teams who tried so i didnt mind letting it go even if they did offer some refunds however since youre a fullblown business and youve got the funding that you need for your main business then i might consider it in this caseor more likely ask if you can simply donate my refund to the planetary society but on the same hand i like the idea of your core business too so i wouldnt be averse to letting you keep the funding either to all of those who are complaining about it being an interest free loan and about the m in funding you are completely incorrect in your assumptions youve forgotten that the arkyd project was a specific sideproject for planetary resources that was for educational purposes and it would in fact require continued support even after the physical satellite itself was completed and launched the arkyd project was going to piggyback on the rd from their main business and use one of the resulting satellites along with all of the necessary resources for managing the satellite and its educational program after launch managing usage time for schools maintenance personnel etc the arkyd funding was not for the creation of planetary resources as a business nor was it for the research and development of their satellite technology the satelites were already going to be built for use in their asteroid mining business completely independently of this project planetary resources was extremely clear about this when the project was originally underway it was that rd along with our initial funding plus the future funding that they had hoped to get from the educational and business sectors that were going to enable them to also do the arkyd as a sibling project the arkyd project is what has failed to survive due to lack of needed interest from the business and educational communities the m in funding that planetary resources has received is not for the arkyd project its for their main businesstwo separate things this was not an interestfree loan for them since this money was never for the purpose of building their businessit was only for the arkyd project and that has sadly failed theyve in fact eaten a huge chunk of money by giving us full refunds since they had to pay kickstarter fees credit card fees and taxes on all of that money when they collected it so yes their offer of a full refund is in fact very thoughtful and honest of them and its much appreciated planetary resources creator on june   hi all a few backers with gmailcom emails have noted the refund email is going to their promotions tab just a heads up in case you dont see the email with the unique link to your refund that it might be in this tab thanks caitlin drow on june   kickstarter has got to be one of the worst ways to secure a loan that it has effectively worked out something like that has no bearing on the motives and intentions of planetary resources their original plan didnt pan out theyve had to pivot to survive and are giving back what they can no longer use the way they hoped to use it and since its a full refund theyre apparently eating the spent costs of the secondary rewards theyve already sent very sad but far short of duplicitous or underhanded my cp simon drake on june   i still like the idea and maybe one day we will get to fund a privately owned earth and space observational cubesat httpwwwspaceventuresinvestorscom planetary resources has done well and its good to get a refund planetary resources creator on may   geoffery r dugdell i see you have successfully submitted your refund request let me know if you need anything else thanks caitlin planetary resources creator on may   ren send me an email so i can resend your refund link kickstarterplanetaryresourcescom also for those who have already submitted their refund requests we are working on getting everyones funds to them in the  week timeline or sooner we stated in the refund form and customer service page faqs here httpskickstarterplanetaryresourcescom… thanks caitlin dan on may   i appreciate that theyre honoring the rules and refunding after not being able to deliver its nevertheless disappointing that they wont be delivering i am curious about this extra spectral business and how it could be new given that landsat data sets have been multispectral since the s hopefully they have an answer for long term calibration and correction of data and maybe they will even keep some data open to the public usgseros provides some really nice pictures of the earth chris spuggy yarrow on may   dick move i hope kickstarter blocks any future funding attempts jamie kinney on may   ren received the email link a few days ago refunds take  days to process through to paypal ren shredder on may   anyone already get their email with the refund link kenrick encinas on may   those who are convinced that this was some underhanded loan really need to understand the concept of evidence better paul eipper on may   youve made two young girls very sad today my goddaughter and her sister were excited to have their pictures in space and be a part of a new space age where everyone could be involved thanks for destroying that today cervator on may   while i am disappointed i can understand what happened although you could have announced it better rather than with the odd disconnect from the other big news about your ceres project and related investment why not just state it as it likely is  the lack of interest prevented you from moving on but rather than fold entirely you managed the good old pivot to salvage  save the company by moving to ceres and attracted an investment with a negotiated piece somewhere allowing you to offer the refunds if you came right out and said it that way i think more people would understand and be less upset rather than believe you used the community as a spring board to attract investment money for something else asis this does set a really poor precedent i wish you the best of luck in getting back to the original mission one day don reba on may   for several commenters calling the kickstarter money an interestfree loan consider that in offering full refunds they are eating significant fees from amazon and kickstarter as well as taxes stephen dahlke on may   while the refund is appreciated in the leastyoucoulddo sense im really not convinced that this project has suddenly become unfeasible considering the  million bucks you just told me you were given using backers as an interestfree norisk loan even if you have opted to repay it rather than default on it is an abuse not only of kickstarter but also individual trust i genuinely believed in what this project set out to do i was excited now im left with nothing but disappointment and regret refunding the money doesnt undo the broken promises of the campaign nor the general distrust this will instill an any such future projects by yourself or other entities the next time someone comes along to crowdfund a space mission theyll be up against the stigma that youve brought to the whole concept thats the biggest disappointment not that you backed out on me and all the rest of the backers but that youve disgraced the whole idea of spacebound citizenscience i had honestly expected better of this campaign and the people behind it geoffery r dugdell on may   you guys are not making it easy all im getting our error messages  rip off ripoff ripoff i say if anyone knows how to then lets get a class action together to sue these guys out of space and time im tired of all the excuses this is my first and last experience on kickstarter as i am so poor im just about homeless tired of being ripped off by rich people no more ← previous    next → leave a comment line icon alert

cochairman and director and chris lewicki as president and chief engineer according to cofounder eric andersen the name arkyd astronautics was deliberately ambiguous to help keep the companys asteroidmining agenda secret the company gained media attention in april  with the announcement of a press conference scheduled for april   the initial press release provided limited information as of april   only a list of major investors and advisors was known included in the list were a number of people notable for their entrepreneurship and interest in space exploration and research some also had previous involvement in space research it was speculated that planetary resources was looking for ways to extract raw materials from nonearth sources as the means by which it would as stated in the press release add trillions of dollars to the global gdp from the outset the dominant assumption was that the company intended to develop asteroid mining operations with one anonymous source reportedly verifying that claim in advance of the april  event arkyd astronautics became a wholly owned subsidiary of planetary resources in july  planetary resources announced an agreement with virgin galactic to enable multiple launch opportunities for its series of spacecraft on launcherone starting with the arkyd series of space telescopes by january  planetary resources had completed a ground test prototype of the arkyd and released a limited set of details publicly in april  planetary resources announced that bechtel corporation has joined planetary resources group of investors and will be a collaborative partner in helping planetary resources achieve its longterm mission of mining asteroids in april  the company announced that they planned on launching a cubesat called arkyd a

of the arkyd spacecraft that planetary resources intends to use for finding nearearth asteroids by mid the company had grown to  employees but still has no firm date for the launch of its first arkyd satellite in may  the company announced it had secured us million in series a funding which it said would be used to deploy and operate a constellation of earth observation satellites to be known as ceres using ten of their arkyd satellites these can be used both for surveying asteroids and for earth observation and feature an arcsecond resolution camera in november  luxembourg invested € million in the company in the form of capital and research and development grants the company announced the investment would be used for the launch of its first asteroid prospecting mission by  luxembourg had recently adopted draft legislation giving private operators rights to materials mined in space plansedit planetary resources aims to develop a robotic asteroid mining industry to achieve this the company is operating on the basis of a longterm strategic plan unveiling the planetary resources dprinted satellite in february  arkyd satellite bus configuration the torus holds the propellant and provides the structure for the satellite from left peter diamandis chris lewicki and steve jurvetson the first stage will be a survey and analysis using purposebuilt satellites in earth orbit to locate the best potential targets among nearearth asteroids several small space telescopes with various sensing capabilities are to be launched for this purpose the company website asserts that their space telescopes will be made available for hire for private uses the company also intends to produce satellites for sale their first model of space telescope the arkyd has been introduced later stages of the strategic plan envision sending survey probes to selected asteroids in order to map including deepscanning and to conduct sampleandanalysis andor sampleandreturn missions the company has stated that it could take a decade to finish identifying the best candidates for commercial mining ultimately their intent is to establish fully automatedrobotic asteroidbased mining and processing operations and the capability to transport the resulting products wherever desired in addition to the extraction of industrial and precious metals for spacebased and terrestrial use the project envisions producing water for an orbital propellant depot funding for the initial space telescope was not forthcoming the accompanying kickstarter campaign was terminated and refunds promised in may  arkyd flight test systemedit planetary resources packaged a number of the nonoptical satellite technologies of the arkyd —essentially the entire base of the arkyd satellite model revealed in january  but without the space telescope— into a costeffective format for early inspace flight testing on a nanosatellite named the arkyd  or a the arkyd testbed satellite was packaged in a u cubesat formfactor of ×× centimetres ×× ft the first attempt to validate and mature the technology met a setback on  october  when the first arkyd test satellite was destroyed during launch in the explosion of the antares rocket carrying it to the international space station iss a second attempt to launch an arkyd spacecraft—designated ar or arkyd reflight— took place on april   with a flight of spacex crs to the iss from where it was planned to be deployed later in the event after spending several months attached to the iss ar was deployed on orbit on  july  to begin flight testing the test flight is expected to have an approximately day duration as of january update the company has been completely silent on the progress of any onorbit testing post deployment from the iss the satellite subsystems being tested on ar include the avionics attitude determination and control system both sensors and actuators and integrated propulsion system that will enable proximity operations for the arkyd line of prospectors in the future ar reentered the atmosphere on  december  arkyd flight test systemedit a second flight test unit for planetary resources—twice the size of ar with a u form

resources inc formerly known as arkyd astronautics is an american company that was formed on  january  and reorganized and renamed in  its stated goal is to expand earths natural resource base by developing and deploying the technologies for asteroid mining although the longterm goal of the company is to mine asteroids its initial plans call for developing a market for small – kg costreduced space telescopes for earth observation and astronomy these spacecraft would employ a laseroptical system for ground communications reducing payload bulk and mass compared to conventional rf antennasnot verified in body the deployment of such orbital telescopes is envisioned as the first step forward in the companys asteroid mining ambitions the same telescope satellite capabilities that planetary resources hopes to sell to customers can be used to survey and intensively examine nearearth asteroids a test satellite named arkyd  reflight ar was launched and successfully transported to earth orbit on  april  and was deployed from the international space station via the nanoracks cubesat deployer on july   the reflight descriptor was used because planetarys first satellite arkyd  was

historyedit planetary resources inc was founded as arkyd astronautics on  january  with peter diamandis as cochairman and director and chris lewicki as president and chief engineer according to cofounder eric andersen the name arkyd astronautics was deliberately ambiguous to help keep the companys asteroidmining agenda secret the company gained media attention in april  with the announcement of a press conference scheduled for april   the initial press release provided limited information as of april   only a list of major investors and advisors was known included in the list were a number of people notable for their entrepreneurship and interest in space exploration and research some also had previous involvement in space research it was speculated that planetary resources was looking for ways to extract raw materials from nonearth sources as the means by which it would as stated in the press release add trillions of dollars to the global gdp from the outset the dominant assumption was that the company intended to develop asteroid mining operations with one anonymous source reportedly verifying that claim in advance of the april  event arkyd astronautics became a wholly owned subsidiary of planetary resources in july  planetary resources announced an agreement with virgin galactic to enable multiple launch opportunities for its series of spacecraft on launcherone starting with the arkyd series of space telescopes by january  planetary resources had completed a ground test prototype of the arkyd and released a limited set of details publicly in april  planetary resources announced that bechtel corporation has joined planetary resources group of investors and will be a collaborative partner in helping planetary resources achieve its longterm mission of mining asteroids in april  the company announced that they planned on launching a cubesat called arkyd a in early  as a testbed manifestation for the arkyd spacecraft the purpose of the flight is to test technologies for the first arkyd spacecraft in the event the first a was launched in fall  but was destroyed in a launch accident a second a spacecraft—designated ar—was launched in april  and deployed into orbit in july  in may  planetary resources announced the launch of kickstarter funding for the arkyd their goal was surpassed on  june  in june  planetary resources took an

to get you started go to exclusive content now meet our team check out the latest news apply for an open position take me to the site planetary resources inc asteroid mining in all geologic time the responsibilities are on our generation  including you  the planetary resources announcement for asteroid mining in response to the planetary resources inc announcement of their plans to mine near earth asteroids permanents analysis and position is as follows their public announcement should start a new space race make no mistake about it the russians and chinese and other nationalistic political leaders and world space program personnel will be analyzing and talking seriously about this government related people tend to err on the side of caution which usually means developing their own plans after all it is paranoia and uncertainty about competing powers which drives a lot of military spending just in case by those responsible for their own countrys position who dont want to risk all that entails with being negligent space resources is a potentially very powerful new development and theyve now been given notice on the private sector side the credibility of the investors businessmen and technical personnel will further take away the giggle factor while adding credibility to asteroid mining which will draw the attention of a lot of wealthy and powerful private sector people in this world it will capture the imagination of many other billionaires and countless millionaires after all for a fraction of the cost of an island off dubai or some other real estate or industrial or mass media project on earth they can invest in space real estate and get to the real elite leadership forefront of society the planetary resources people were asked why they announced today after all they have kept this a secret since  why now their stated answer was recruiting the best engineers in the world they said the timing was also because they had completed their fundraising stage yet they said that they want to keep a small and dynamic team so there are not nearly enough positions for all the people who will apply they have approximately  engineers today and seemed to not want to grow a lot more in order to control costs as well as company culture focusing on the most knowledgeable and productive individuals furthermore they could systematically recruit people who have already worked on space probes by simply researching whos who in those previous projects and veteran space people would find you about them and visit their website without such a high profile announcement so a buckshot high profile public announcement for recruiting seem a little bit puzzling they have expressed interest in reaching out to people outside of the space community such as people in the earth mining business however there should be other motivations for all the professional public relations videos which they have so carefully prepared which goes way beyond recruitment you dont need much to recruit space specialists to come to seattle and there are already a lot of professionals in the earth mining and other industries who are interested in space resources more than can be handled a bigger motivation would be creating a market for their products and services and reaching out to that market a new space economy it is notable that they repeatedly highlighted that they are creating a new market worth billions to trillions of dollars there needs to be some advance notice in order to generate this market in advance of their products and services a market of this nature will take some time to take root both psychologically and in the development of plans one of the press asked whether they will be selling their data well thats a small start for some early cash flow other markets they mentioned are platinum group metals for earth fuel propellants and water and supplies to space stations there are actually countless potential products and services but these are the simplest and most basic needs in high demand and value now they said that they completed their fundraising which was probably very targeted since they kept this a secret they apparently are not looking for anybody else to buy private stock in this particular company planetary resources inc they may also be trying to brand as a first high profile venture there appeared to be considerable pride and excitement motivating this announcement for whatever reasons they have surely stirred up potential competition and fired the gun to start the space race during the announcement they made clear that this is all robotic not human when somebody asked whether there were any planned human missions nobody mentioned that bringing back all this water metal and various other volatiles and materials would be crucial to building space condos and other real estate in near earth space on a large scale economically send the robots to asteroids keep the humans close to earth i thought they missed an exciting announcement there  unless they had decided to keep that a secret eg the real estate angle as theyve kept this company a secret for  years it does raise the question of how many others have kept things secret likewise this announcement would remove a lot of the need for others to keep asteroid ventures secret since others wont be a first anymore and planetary resources has jumped the gun to start a new space race there will be pressure for other space professionals and powers to respond by showing that they arent clueless and are doing their jobs in a competitive way there was an expression of american nationalism during the news conference that can have a variety of reactions around the world  which overall is good this should spur on investment in competitors peter diamandis has done a great job piecing this one together after roughly  years of perseverance and experience i think i first met him about  years ago as a young space resources promoter peter has finally put together a sufficiently funded space resources team there are few people in this world who have impressed me as much as peter diamandis and he deserves to go down in history as the prime mover in planetary resources and firing the gun to start the space race on extraterrestrial real estate our species owes a lot to this individual peter diamandis some people will ask why they chose asteroids instead of the lunar poles a popular debate it is very fortunate that they have chosen asteroids because the lunar poles are already getting a whole lot of attention also it would have been less interesting to the world if they were going back to the moon we should diversify in space resources between the asteroids and the moon so what about permanent obviously this will stir up a whole lot of interest in permanent however what is permanents position and plans as director i am more interested in further developing that space race likewise to respond to messages to date from various people i am not interested in applying for a job at planetary resources im not concerned with my own personal benefits i am most concerned about making sure that space resources are developed and dont want us to rely  on planetary resources indeed we need a space race and some healthy competition to speed up space resources utilization if humans are to get off the planet before biotechnology or nanotechnology human extinction threats mature another section on this website as covered in my other website wwwgainextinctioncom  personally i am most interested in contributing to progress by doing what nobody else is doing and which needs to be done right now that means consulting to one or more competitors permanent is more than  years old a whole lot of knowledge has been gained in those  years which can be applied to helping startups around the world this is why i chose to work in the us space program soon after graduating from the university in advanced planning in washington dc this is why i learned the russian language this is why i sought experience living and working in asia starting in  this is why i have been reading technical reports and building up a library on space resources for  years something you cannot condense into a short time this is why i have been getting to know who is who for  years this is why i chose to run my own businesses as ceo there is no substitute for experience if you need a consultant here i am if you want to be a consultant too with permanent then send us your cv and information engineers artists programmers public relations people lawyers  the space economy needs all kinds of people lets get started now if you are already a space resources professional then dont be late and miss opportunities if you are a newcomer it will take some time to get up to speed enough to compete as a good consultant or employee for some space entity for a private or public sector venture leader it will take time to get up to speed as a viable competitor however this is the future of our lives so better to start sooner than later to get in more at the ground level permanent has always
