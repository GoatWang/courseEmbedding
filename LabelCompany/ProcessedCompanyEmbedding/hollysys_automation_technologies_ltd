some key events during this quarter with market stabilization in parts of process industries the performance of industrial automation has been getting better especially recent order trend reflecting a positive momentum through actively traced our customers new demands under adjusting circumstance we got several significant contracts for example in power we signed the contract to provide products for sichuan jiangyou xmw power units shanxi yangmei xmw power units in chemical we provided dcs and sis for producing polycarbonate of luxi chemical company in petrochemical we won the contract to provide dcs to shengli oilfield gudong production plant in nuclear power we are continuing providing dcs for hongyanhe number  and number  units and tianwan number  and number  units for factory automation after changing strategies from selling products to providing solutions to customers we did have some progress such as hair project to help the customer improve the level of automation and intelligence of their tianjinbased factory which focuses on washing machines integrated internal resources to provide the production and hai di lao hot pot project to help the customer improve their efficiency of hot pot based making in the restaurant hollysys aims to make each project into a demonstration project to create values to the customers and explore more opportunities in subindustries in highspeed railway we won  catps   catps but since the customer is changing the procurement timeline it increases uncertainty and volatility of the performance of the highspeed railway in addition since it is the beginning of the  fiveyear plan the finished infrastructure of new planned railway is limited therefore in shortterm the performance of highspeed rail segment was unfavorable however from long run according to the mid and longterm plan of highspeed railway and with the increase of the after sell and replacement as well as new products launch we expect the sector will gradually recover in the future for subway we won the contract to provide power scada for dalian intercity line from jinzhou to pulandianwan in the mechanical and electrical installation services although concord and bond are facing some difficulties because of the local political and economic uncertainties in south east asia and middle east area they are still working hard to develop businesses as one of the strategies to expand overseas market we will ensure a healthy development of concord and bond and take use of their advantages such as good customer relations and sales channels to find more international opportunities with that i would like to turn the call over to arden xia who will read the financial results analysis on behalf of our cfo ms herriet qu arden xia thank you mr shao i

translation operator please questionandanswer session operator thank you mr arden xia we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from the line of alex chang please ask your questions alex chang and the first question about the new order the third quarter we found it is recovered very good so can you talk about the structure of the new orders especially the railway transportation and we estimated eight from the number of atps procurement it should be us million but it seems like us million right now so what about distribution and also i want to ask the formal days from the official crc procurement website we could see the new order for c and there are three companies won the bidding so how about hollysys – how much hollysys could get the second question is about the sharebased compensation and this quarter we saw this number is positive can you explain about it arden xia okay the first question about the railway transportation structure the distribution you can see if compare your prediction is larger but actually we just announced a significant contract we gained a lot of supplement contract in this quarter for example like hong kong mtr project because this project is delaying so we get some payment from the customer and also the small tcc project and also including the other supplemented project for the former larger projects the sharebased compensation is based on the guidance last time we – the disclosure based on this guidance the management team cannot achieve the target so they cannot get the options the options based on the performance of the eps for example so this quarter the cost of amortization we do adjustment so we could see gain from the value and next quarter we have continued the same thing booking into the financials but the number will be smaller than this quarter let me translate the last one mr shao said because several days ago the official website disclosed the bidding won for three companies but the number – we not signed the contract yet so we cannot disclose that at this time and back the last question of alex he asked about the atp contract currently the asp for the c and c are there any changes and the answer is just last fiscal year the c segment had a onetime discount for the asp within kilometer for our segment but right now when we won the contract our recover for the regular price thank you alex operator your next question comes from the line of jacqueline du from goldman sachs please ask your question jacqueline du the question is about the guidance based on the first nine months of the performance we not changed the guidance so does this means that fourth quarter we have to achieve more than  million revenue to meet the guidance so can you explain about the – because this has not happened in the history so can you explain more about the guidance arden xia in current situation the guidance is really meet the challenge but this is not as you mentioned that it will bring the revenue treatment by the new businesses we especially focused on the highspeed rail and this part the performance is uncertainty and it will affect the revenue and net income sharply so thats why – because currently the crc side not very transparency so its hard for us to make the precise prediction for the guidance that is to say the performance is really based on the highspeed rail performance at the end of this fiscal year jacqueline du so for the factory automation what about the progress and – within the new businesses and also relate to the revenue contribution how we could expect the timeline arden xia for the new business or technology looking at them like the traction okay we will have the order but the topline hardly to give you right now and for factory automation from – we changed the strategy from singleproduct sales to the total solutions provide and we based on several subindustries to do appraised demonstration projects right now everything is – goes well but from the contract or revenue to see it cannot make even of the declining i mean it is not very – too large contract size cannot support right now for the longterm we have confidence to develop this area keep a very high growth rate jacqueline du the first question is about some risks control that – from our side we think that there are some risks for example like the atp bidding procurement we can see the c segment the – can we grow the size – the company can grow the size its the first time to join this area so is this will affect the market share in the future and the second question about the mechanical and electrical installation services there are some uncertainties can you explain more about this indiscernible arden xia from the hollysys highspeed rail revenue aspect as compared to  and  the sharp decrease is a onetime problem not structural for the shortterm to see it is hard to achieve the performance of fiscal year  because the year based at the end of th fiveyear plan and there was – were a lot of atps so from the market share aspect this is a longterm issue we cannot maintain  market share in  kilometer segment but we will keep at least the  for both c and c and also can we realtime new player joining we are disclosed to the institutional investors before and meanwhile i mean – at last i want to measure some good areas from the mid longterm to see the highspeed railway aftersale revenue will keep steady growth and also new products new technology like the track circuit will join and the very important thing is replacement cycle or treatment life cycle with  years now just to meet the cycle so what we sold the atp well sell again all of this will secure highspeed rail revenue keep a steady performance in the future the mechanical and electrical installation services segment because this area focus – the business focuses on southeast asia and those local economic not very good in recent years so we meet a lot of competition and especially from the new orders to see still have challenge but we are trying our best to do the business right now you could see the me sector of the revenue growth came out is  but no matter what just add to the fact that the potential risk for those areas still exists especially we mentioned the new orders side thank you operator next one operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of thomas zhang from morgan stanley please ask your question thomas zhang the first question about the pl which we see the share net income after the investee that item was inside especially the hollycon how much performance by the hollycon and of course last fiscal year we could see our government subsidy from the nuclear power jv also included data within this item so can you explain how much about the net subsidy and the second question about the industrial automation new order right now we see the trend is very good and compare increase but its separated by the dcs demand which industry performance is better and can you explain based on industries thank you arden xia the first question about the net income equity investee this part was based on equity matters and inside there has mainly two companies one is hollycon and that company will hold around  shares and the jv with cgnpc that company hold around  and this time  million we could see  million from hollycon and also you said right last year we have subsidy from the jv cgnpc that total number would be cny million if transferred to the us dollar it would be  million around thomas zhang and the question is about the – so that is to say in the last nine months performance of jv with cgnpc that company is positive arden xia the answer is yes the industry automation side too are hardworking from mainland to see right now the new contract compare increased a lot and this is based on we received our existing projects and large customers to do the upgrading those kind of things and we found a lot of new opportunities and from the whole industry to see it is based on the large industries what we gained before like the thermal power like the chemical petrochemical those industries increasing and also new energy and we do that – but right now the total environment is still hard to say but we do it very cautious and optimistic and next quarter to be frank the revenue would be turn to positive compares and we have confident to maintain and industrial automation gradually recover in the future because the timeline constraint so the last question please operator operator thank you sir your last question comes from the line of patrick xu from nomura please ask your question patrick xu the first question is about the order within the highspeed rail sector from the backlog to see it is compare not goes down very fast so – but the highspeed rail revenue is continue declining so can you explain about this trend i mean especially the backlog is going down whats the reason behind the second question about the working capital we could see the dso days and inventory days goes up can you explain about that the third one is miscellaneous it seems like compare last fiscal year the miscellaneous items have not been right now so is there anything changed behind or can you please explain about this item arden xia the first question about the new order within the highspeed rail is to see the backlog structure actually it contains less atp than before however our atp contract recognized revenue compared tcc is shorter for example normally it would be six to  months finished recognized revenue but tcc will be one or two year but right now our – because we – the atp contract is delaying so we have last atp contract within the backlog but relatively the high base belongs to after sale tcc those contracts but average the recognized revenue period would be one or two years the dso days goes up is not means the ar getting larger actually you could see the absolutely – value for the account receivable is still stable and at this time its because the revenue goes down so thats why dso day goes up and inventory because we are right now preparing the goods for the potential contracts so thats why the inventory is increasing the miscellaneous because last fiscal year that one represented the large percentage of hollycon but hollycon diluted from  to  and right now we lost control of hollycon so not consolidated with the financials thats why this time the miscellaneous you could see have no things and this part right now you could see from the pl the equity investee area thank you patrick xu the question is about – you said the inventory goes up can you explain which part of the business prepare for the inventory arden xia the answer is highspeed rail would be much – the larger percentage than the others thank you patrick end of qa arden xia okay thank you everyone for joining us on the call today if
