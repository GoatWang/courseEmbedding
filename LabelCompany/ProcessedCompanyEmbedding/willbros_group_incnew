generated by recurring services will make our business model more predictable and allow us to reduce our dependence on large capital projects which are more cyclical in nature focus on managing risk we have implemented a core set of business conduct practices and policies to improve our risk profile including diversifying our service offerings and end markets to reduce marketspecific exposure and focusing on contractexecution risk starting with our opportunity review process and ending at job completion we continue to evaluate and improve our risk management techniques maintain financial flexibility maintaining the financial flexibility to meet the material equipment and personnel needs to support our project commitments as well as the ability to pursue our expansion and diversification objectives is critical to our performance and growth insurance and bonding certain operational risks are analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and insured against through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program we maintain worldwide master commercial insurance policies written through highlyrated insurers in types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the project management and construction industry these policies cover our property plant equipment and cargo against normallyinsurable risks other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with industry standards for the level of our operations and asset base risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients on other projects “builders all risk insurance” is purchased when deemed necessary all insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level except for certain basic insurance that must be purchased locally to comply with insurance laws the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective in all circumstances or against all hazards an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future our ability to maintain insurance which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable may be affected by events over which we have no control we have been limited in our pursuit

that fall into the following basic categories • firm fixedprice or lump sum fixedprice contracts providing for a single price for the total amount of work • cost plus fixed fee contracts where income is earned solely from the fee received • unitprice contracts which specify a price for each unit of work performed • time and materials contracts where personnel and equipment are provided under an agreedupon schedule of daily rates with other direct costs being reimbursable • a combination of the above including lump sum payment for certain items and unit rates for others and • msas under which we receive work orders for specific projects and which involve one or more of the foregoing categories changes in scopeofwork are subject to change orders to be agreed upon by both parties change orders not agreed to in either scope or price result in claims to be resolved in a dispute resolution process these change orders and claims can affect our contract revenue and liquidity either positively or negatively we usually obtain contracts through either competitive bidding or negotiations with longstanding clients we are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by our clients who maintain approved bidder lists bidders are prequalified on the basis of their prior performance for such clients as well as their experience reputation for quality safety record financial strength and bonding capacity in evaluating bid opportunities we consider such factors as the clients and their geographic location the difficulty of the work current and projected workload the likelihood of additional work the project’s cost and profitability estimates and our competitive advantage relative to other likely bidders the bid estimate forms the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project control system enabling management to monitor projects effectively virtually all of our contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client in addition some contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements that require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances within our control we act as the prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake in our capacity as the prime contractor or when acting as a subcontractor we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract specialized activities as hazardous waste removal horizontal directional drills nondestructive inspection catering and security in the construction industry the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract including subcontract work thus when acting as the prime contractor we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated under a fixedprice contract we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project based upon specific assumptions and project criteria if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur our margins will decrease possibly resulting in a loss the revenue cost and gross profit realized on a fixedprice contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks we  table of contents index to financial statements may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and may incur losses on projects depending on the size of a project these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year in some cases we are able to recover additional costs and profits from the client through the change order process in general turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixedprice basis involve an increased risk of significant variations this increased risk is a result of the nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract our accounting policy related to contract variations and claims requires recognition of all costs as incurred revenue from change orders extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when an agreement is reached with the client as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price profit on change orders extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when realization is reasonably assured also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other customerrelated causes of unanticipated additional contract costs unapproved change orders these amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near term if we do not successfully resolve these matters a net expense recorded as a reduction in revenues may be required in addition to amounts that have been previously provided contractual arrangements we provide services under msas and on a projectbyproject basis msas are typically one to three years in duration but can be longer under our msas our customers generally agree to use us to provide certain services in a specified geographic region on stipulated terms and conditions including pricing and escalation however most of our contracts including msas and our alliance agreement with oncor may be terminated by our customers on short notice further although our customers assign work to us under our msas our customers often have no obligation to assign work to us and are not required to use us exclusively in some cases subject to our right of first refusal in addition many of our contracts including our msas are opened to public bid and generally attract multiple bidders work performed under msas is typically billed on a unitprice or timeandmaterials basis in addition any work encountered in the course of a unitprice project that does not have a defined unit is generally completed on a timeandmaterials basis although the terms of our contracts vary considerably pricing is typically based on a unitprice or fixedprice structure under our unitprice contracts we agree to perform identified units of work for an agreed price a “unit” can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation the resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit under fixedprice contracts we agree to perform the contract for a fixed fee based on our estimate of the aggregate costs of completing the particular project we are sometimes unable to fully recover cost overruns on our fixedprice contracts industry trends could increase the proportion of our contracts being performed on a unitprice or fixedprice basis increasing our profitability risk our storm restoration work which involves high labor and equipment utilization is typically performed on a timeandmaterials basis and is generally more profitable when performed offsystem rather than for customers with which we have msas our ability to allocate resources to storm restoration work depends on our capacity at that time and permission from existing customers to release some portion of our workforce from their projects we attempt to manage contract risk by implementing a standard contracting philosophy to minimize liabilities assumed in the agreements with our clients however there may be contracts or msas in place that do not meet our current contracting standards while we have made efforts to improve our contractual terms with our clients this process takes time to implement we have attempted to mitigate the risk by requesting amendments to our contracts and by maintaining primary and excess insurance with certain specified limits to mitigate our exposure in the event of a loss oncor alliance agreement on june   infrastrux group llc “infrastrux” a company we acquired in july  entered into a nonexclusive agreement with oncor due to the extensive scope and long duration of the agreement we refer to it as an alliance agreement we summarize below the principal terms of the agreement this

that we will provide oncor transmission construction and maintenance services “tcm” and distribution construction and maintenance services “dcm” pursuant to fixedprice unitprice and timeandmaterials structures the fees we charge oncor under unitprice and timeandmaterials structures are set forth in the agreement most of which are adjusted annually according to indices provided in the agreement the agreement also includes a provision whereby oncor receives pricing at least as favorable as we charge other customers for any “similar services” which is not a defined term in the agreement management believes based on our pricing practices and the nature and scope of the services we provide to oncor that we are in compliance with this provision we frequently hold meetings with oncor to discuss its forecasted monthly and annual tcm and dcm spending levels the agreement provides for agreed incentives and adjustments for us and for oncor according to oncor’s projected spending levels calculations based on projected spending levels are subject to subsequent adjustments based on actual spending levels the agreement also requires that we provide dedicated resources to oncor and that we meet or exceed minimum service levels as measured by specified performance indicators termination  oncor could in some cases seek to terminate for cause or limit our activity or seek to assess penalties against us under the agreement oncor may terminate the agreement upon days notice or any work request thereunder without prior notice in each case at its sole discretion and may terminate

global warming and climate change recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere as a result there have been a variety of regulatory developments proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases we do not know and cannot predict whether any proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments depending on the final provisions of such rules or legislation it is possible that such future laws and regulations could result in increasing our compliance costs or capital spending requirements or creating additional operating restrictions on us or our customers it is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels and increase the demand for renewable energy sources which could adversely affect the demand for some of our services and improve the demand for some of our other services likewise we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change or otherwise will have a material impact on our operations compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not to date had a material effect on the cost of our

risk factors the nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks risks related to our business our business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure our revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major construction projects the availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil and gas and electric power industries and specifically the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure our failure to obtain major projects the delay in awards of major projects the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the underutilization of our resources which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow numerous factors beyond our control influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies including • current and projected oil and gas and electric power prices • the demand for gasoline and electricity • the abilities of oil and gas and electric power companies to generate access and deploy capital • exploration production and transportation costs • the discovery rate and location of new oil and gas reserves • the sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions • regulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers • local and international political and economic conditions and • technological advances we face a risk of noncompliance with certain covenants in our credit facilities we are subject to a number of financial and other covenants under our credit facilities including a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio on march   march   july   and march   we amended our  term credit agreement pursuant to a first amendment third amendment fourth amendment and fifth amendment the “fifth amendment” these amendments among other things suspend the calculation of the maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio for the period from december   through june   the “covenant suspension periods” so that any failure by us to comply with the maximum total leverage ratio or minimum interest coverage ratio covenants during the covenant suspension periods will not be deemed to result in a default or event of default prior to obtaining the fifth amendment we did not expect to be in compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio for the period from march   through december   we can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants in the periods following the completion of the covenant suspension periods or that we would be successful in obtaining additional waivers or amendments to these covenants should they become necessary under the fifth amendment the maximum total leverage ratio will be  to  as of september   and will decrease to  to  as of december   and  to  as of june   and thereafter the minimum interest coverage ratio will be  to  as of september   and will increase to  to  as of december   and  to  as of june   and thereafter if our results of operations do not improve in  we will be unable to meet the required financial covenants in order to ensure future compliance with our financial covenants we may elect to prepay our credit agreement indebtedness by accessing capital markets or with cash on hand however we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in accessing capital markets on terms we consider favorable or reducing costs in amounts sufficient to comply with our financial covenants moreover future prepayments or refinancing of the balance of the  term credit agreement will in most cases require us to pay a prepayment premium equal to the “makewhole” amount the makewhole amount is calculated as the present value of all interest payments that would have been made on the amount prepaid from the date of the prepayment to december   or june   if the prepayment is made on or after june   at a rate per annum equal to the sum of  percent plus the greater of  percent and the eurodollar rate in effect on the date of the repayment  table of contents index to financial statements even if we successfully comply with our financial covenants we may suffer adverse consequences if our unused availability under our  abl credit facility drops below certain levels if our unused availability under the  abl credit facility is less than the greater of i  percent of the revolving commitments or  million for five consecutive days or ii  percent of the revolving commitments or  million at any time we are subject to increased reporting requirements the administrative agent will have exclusive control over any deposit account we will not have any right of access to or withdrawal from any deposit account or any right to direct the disposition of funds in any deposit account and amounts in any deposit account will be applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the  abl credit facility in addition if our unused availability under the  abl credit facility is less than the amounts described in the preceding sentence we would be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant our unused availability under the  abl credit facility was  million at december   we do not expect our availability under the  abl credit facility to drop to levels which would require us to comply with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant over the next  months however if the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio were to become applicable we would not expect to be in compliance with this covenant a default under the  abl credit facility would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit require us to immediately repay any outstanding cash advances with interest and require us to cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations a default under the  term credit agreement would permit the lenders to require immediate repayment of all principal interest fees and other amounts payable thereunder if the maturity of our credit agreement indebtedness were accelerated we may not have sufficient funds to pay such indebtedness in such an event our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness which includes substantially all of our assets to the extent permitted by the credit agreements and applicable law our industry is highly competitive which could impede our growth we operate in a highly competitive environment a substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals we compete for these projects against companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do in some markets there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures greater resources or other advantages and therefore may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept we have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis as a result our business operating results and liquidity could be harmed we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that led to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements most recently for the first three quarters of  and the first two quarters of  we also identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of december    and  and for the years  through  we believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity furthermore because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements a pending securities class action against us has resulted in significant costs and expenses has diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows as further described in note  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k after we announced that we would be restating our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period ended june   a securities class action complaint was filed against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas on behalf of our shareholders and alleging damages on their behalf arising from the matters that led to the restatements in addition to us two of our former chief executive officers and our current chief financial officer are named as defendants we have incurred andor expect to incur significant professional fees and other costs in defending against the  table of contents index to financial statements allegations made by the plaintiffs in the class action suit if we do not prevail in the pending litigation we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage in addition our board of directors management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on the pending litigation diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy all of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows our use of fixedprice contracts could adversely affect our operating results a significant portion of our revenues is currently generated by fixedprice contracts under a fixedprice contract we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project based upon a defined scope which includes specific assumptions and project criteria if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur our margins will decrease and we may incur a loss the revenue cost and gross profit realized on a fixedprice contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects depending on the size of a project these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year in general turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixedprice basis involve an increased risk of significant variations this risk is a result of the longterm nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract in addition our utility td segment also generates substantial revenue under unitprice contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price which have similar associated risks as those identified above for fixedprice contracts a “unit” can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation the resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses percentageofcompletion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in adjustments that would materially affect our operating results we recognize contract revenue using the percentageofcompletion method on longterm fixedprice contracts under this method estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs taking into consideration physical completion estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined accordingly contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved and adjustments based upon the percentageofcompletion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised these estimates are based on management’s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience and are only estimates variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material to the extent that these adjustments result in an increase a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings which could be material our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is therefore an uncertain indicator of our future earnings we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time in addition project cancellations terminations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits therefore project terminations suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog finally poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits managing backlog in our utility td segment also has other challenges backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends seasonal demand and projected customer needs but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice for projects in this segment on which we have commenced work that are canceled we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog  table of contents index to financial statements legislative or regulatory actions relating to electricity transmission and renewable energy may impact the demand for our services current and potential legislative or regulatory actions may impact demand for our services certain legislation or regulations require utilities to meet reliability standards and encourage installation of new electric transmission and renewable energy generation facilities however it is unclear whether these initiatives will create sufficient incentives for projects or result in increased demand for our services while many states have mandates in place that require specified percentages of electricity to be generated from renewable sources states could reduce those mandates or make them optional which could reduce delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states additionally renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as a backup the locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and may not be viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity to demand centers is economically feasible furthermore funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available these factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure which could negatively impact our business seasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results profitability cash flow and working capital needs related to our operating segments a significant portion of our business in each of our operating segments is performed outdoors consequently our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather our operating segments perform less work in the winter months and work is hindered during other inclement weather events in particular our utility td segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete during periods of peak electric power demand in the summer utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power td equipment from service decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods the seasonality of this segment’s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate because this segment’s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment’s working capital during the spring and summer conversely our canada segment typically posts its strongest results during the winter and summer months and weaker results during what is known as the “spring breakup” when road bans and load limits are put in place and workers are often furloughed and equipment idled severe winter weather can also create demand for restoration of storm damage to overhead utility lines which can offer opportunities for high margin emergency restoration work for our utility td segment our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us we occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price these types of claims occur due to matters such as ownercaused delays or changes from the initial project scope which result in additional costs both direct and indirect these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition our business is dependent on a limited number of key clients we operate primarily in the oil and gas and power industries providing services to a limited number of clients much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients the loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations one client was responsible for approximately  percent of total contract revenue from continuing operations in  this client was also responsible for  percent of our month backlog and  percent of our total backlog at december    terrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations our ability to raise capital or secure insurance or our future growth the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations in addition future acts of terrorism could be  table of contents index to financial statements directed against companies operating both outside and inside the united states further the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments may subject our operations to increased risks and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business our operations are subject to a number of operational risks our business operations include pipeline construction fabrication pipeline rehabilitation services and a wide range of services in electric power and natural gas transmission and distribution we may encounter difficulties that impact our ability to complete a project in accordance with the original delivery schedule these difficulties may be the result of delays in designs engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery schedule changes delays from our customers failure to timely obtain permits or rightsofway or meet other regulatory requirements weatherrelated delays delays caused by difficult worksite environments and other factors some of which are beyond our control we also may encounter project delays due to local opposition which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests to the siting of electric transmission lines pipelines or other facilities especially those which are located in environmentally or culturally sensitive areas and more heavily populated areas we may not be able to recover the costs we incur that are caused by delays in certain circumstances we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties including liquidated damages and such amounts could exceed expected project profit in extreme cases the abovementioned factors could cause project cancellations and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts our operations also involve a number of operational hazards natural disasters adverse weather conditions collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property equipment and the environment and suspension of operations in locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination the occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage loss of revenue casualty loss increased costs and significant liability to third parties the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties can affect customer relationships result in higher operating costs negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover workplace safety is important to us our employees and our customers as a result we maintain comprehensive safety programs and training to all applicable employees throughout our organization while we focus on protecting people and property our work is performed at construction sites and in industrial facilities and our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing these services even with proper safety precautions these hazards can lead to personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property plant and equipment and environmental damage we are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees we have experienced serious accidents including fatalities in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future serious accidents may subject us to penalties civil litigation or criminal prosecution claims for damages to persons including claims for bodily injury or loss of life could result in costs and liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors some of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties in addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work where work is performed through a joint venture we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture itself in these projects even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications  table of contents index to financial statements we act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake in our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract certain specialized activities such as hazardous waste removal nondestructive inspection and catering and security however with respect to other contracts including those in our utility td segment we may choose to subcontract a substantial portion of the project in the construction industry the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract including subcontract work thus when acting as a prime contractor we are subject to the risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated we are selfinsured against many potential liabilities although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability general liability workers’ compensation and employee group health claims many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles and we are selfinsured up to the amount of the deductible since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies we are effectively selfinsured for the overwhelming majority of claims we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly however insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors the effects of which are often unknown including the severity of an injury the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program if our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity our operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities our us and canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent we regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas such as rivers lakes and wetlands part of the business in our utility td segment is performed in the southwestern us where there is a greater risk of fines work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing native american artifacts and archeological sites significant fines penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person in addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances these laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed we own and operate several properties in the united states and canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” the resource compensation and recovery act “rcra” andor analogous state provincial or local laws cercla imposes joint and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment while rcra governs the generation storage transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes under these or similar laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property the expenses related to this work could have a significant impact on our future results our operations outside of the us and canada are oftentimes potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment we are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere as a result there have been a variety of regulatory developments proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced andor issued in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases although it is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation or regulations including those introduced or adopted in the future would impact our business and operations it is possible that such laws and regulations could result in greater  table of contents index to financial statements compliance costs capital spending requirements or operating restrictions for us andor our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services we are also unable to predict how the outcome of the  federal and state elections may affect any existing or proposed regulations or legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we may not be able to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain any necessary bonds letters of credit bank guarantees or other financial assurances our contracts may require that we provide to our customers security for the performance of their projects in the form of bonds letters of credit or other financial assurances current or future market conditions including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew or substantially reduce the amount of bid or performance bonds for our work these actions could be taken on short notice if our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding or letters of credit our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders and finding more business that does not require bonds or allows for other form of collateral for project performance such as cash we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances furthermore under standard terms in the surety market sureties issue or continue bonds on a projectbyproject basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding we are dependent upon the services of our executive management our success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team we do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals in the past few years we have experienced significant turnover at the senior management level we believe that we currently have in place competitive compensation programs with strong retention incentives for our senior management however the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations our business is labor intensive and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees our ability to maintain our productivity and improve profitability will be limited by our ability to employ train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our strategy we contribute to multiemployer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or we withdraw from those plans we contribute to several multiemployer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements these plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of  imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan in the event of the employer’s withdrawal from or upon termination of such plan in addition if the funding of any of these multiemployer plans becomes in “critical status” under the pension protection act of  we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans a number of plans to which our business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in “endangered” or “critical” status certain of these plans may require additional contributions generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans the amount of additional funds if any that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans  table of contents index to financial statements our settlements with the doj and the sec may negatively impact us in the event of a future fcpa violation our failure to comply with the fcpa or other antibribery laws would have a material adverse effect on our business in may  after reaching agreement with the company the department of justice “doj” filed an information and deferred prosecution agreement “dpa” concluding its investigation into violations of the fcpa by willbros group inc and its subsidiary willbros international inc also in may  we reached a final settlement with the sec to resolve its previously disclosed investigations of possible violations of the fcpa and possible violations of the securities act of  and the securities exchange act of  these investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in bolivia ecuador and nigeria we made the final payments under these settlements in october  the criminal information associated with the dpa was dismissed with prejudice on april   currently we have no employees working outside of the united states and canada under the sec settlement we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws our failure to abide by the fcpa and other laws could result in prosecution and other regulatory sanctions and severely impact our operations a criminal conviction for violations of the fcpa could result in fines civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief and would have a material adverse effect on our business special risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent since the antibribery restrictions of the fcpa make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence currently we have no employees working outside of the united states

energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries with offerings that primarily include construction maintenance and facilities development services our principal markets for continuing operations are the united states and canada we obtain our work through competitive bidding and negotiations with prospective clients contract values range from several thousand dollars to several hundred million dollars and contract durations range from a few weeks to more than two years willbros has three reportable segments oil  gas  utility td and canada  these segments are comprised of strategic businesses that are defined by the industries or geographic regions they serve each segment is managed as an operation with wellestablished strategic directions and performance requirements each segment is led by a separate segment president who reports directly to the codm our oil  gas segment provides construction maintenance and lifecycle extension services to the midstream markets these services include pipeline construction to support the transportation and storage of hydrocarbons including gathering lateral and mainline pipeline systems as well as facilities construction such as pump stations flow stations gas compressor stations and metering stations in addition the oil  gas segment provides integrity construction pipeline systems maintenance and tank services to a number of different customers at december   the assets and liabilities associated with tank services have been classified as held for sale see note   assets held for sale in item  of this form k for more information our utility td segment provides a wide range of services in electric and natural gas transmission and distribution including comprehensive engineering procurement maintenance and construction repair and restoration of utility infrastructure our canada segment provides construction maintenance and fabrication services including integrity and supporting civil work pipeline construction general mechanical and facility construction api storage tanks general and modular fabrication along with electrical and instrumentation projects serving the canadian energy and water industries the codm evaluates segment performance using operating income which is defined as contract revenue less contract costs and segment overhead such as amortization related to intangible assets and general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to the segment in  we implemented a change to our organizational structure such that corporate overhead costs such as executive management public company accounting tax and professional services human resources and treasury are no longer allocated to each segment previously reported segment information has been revised to conform to this new presentation general economic and market conditions coupled with the highly competitive nature of our industry continue to result in pricing pressure on the services we provide in our oil  gas and canada segments  table of contents index to financial statements looking forward we took difficult but necessary steps in  to reduce our overall cost structure from both a segment and corporate perspective our efforts to better align our costs with lower revenue has led to an improvement in our continuing operating results when compared to  we believe we have positioned the company to address the challenges and opportunities in  we anticipate our utility td segment will continue to execute its growth strategy we believe opportunities exist to expand our transmission capabilities to service new customers and this initiative remains a top priority our distribution services are positioned to further enhance its capabilities after successfully expanding its footprint in  in both the southeast and eastern regions of the united states our oil  gas segment has modified its focus to address relatively smaller opportunities both in terms of size and duration including middiameter pipeline systems integrity and facilities work this segment is less dependent on large diameter pipeline construction but continues to bid and has retained the capability to perform this work in addition we anticipate growth in the northeast as we continue to operate in the active marcellus and utica fields in our canada segment competition among contractors for ongoing maintenance work and small capital projects continues to put pressure on operating margins we anticipate large capital projects will stay below historical levels for  and we therefore remain focused on serving our clients maintenance needs through msa agreement renewals and sustaining their small capital projects coupled with tank construction pipeline integrity work mid and small diameter pipeline opportunities and water industry construction services other financial measures backlog backlog broadly consists of anticipated contract revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts additionally due to the short duration of many jobs revenue associated with jobs won and performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in quarterly backlog reports we generate revenue from numerous sources including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes including change orders extra work and variations in the scope of work these revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured our backlog presentation reflects not only the  month lumpsum and msa work but also the fullterm value of work under contract including msa work as we believe that this information is helpful in providing additional longterm visibility we determine the amount of backlog for work under ongoing msa maintenance and construction contracts based on historical trends inherent in the msas factoring in seasonal demand and projecting customer needs based on ongoing communications with the customer at december    total backlog was approximately  million  and  month backlog was approximately  million  in comparison to december    total backlog decreased approximately  million  and  month backlog decreased approximately  million  the decrease in total and  month backlog is primarily attributed to the workoff of revenue which is outpacing our additions in the oil  gas and canada segments approximately  million of total and  month backlog is attributed to our tank services business which is classified as held for sale at december   our tank services business is included in our oil  gas segment  table of contents index to financial

of work in our electric transmission construction services which includes work performed under our alliance agreement with oncor as well as growth in distribution msa work along the atlantic seaboard texas and the gulf coast the increase was partially offset by the absence of matting services associated with bemis which was sold in  operating income increased  million in  primarily driven by the increased volume of work described above which led to higher margins the increase is also partly attributed to a decrease in insurance and other employee related costs coupled with the absence of other charges associated with the abandonment of certain equipment and facility leases across the segment compared to  the increase is partially offset by a reduction of income generated from matting services in bemis which was sold in  canada segment contract revenue decreased  million in  primarily related to a lower volume of work across the entire segment due to low prevailing oil and gas

the calculation of the maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio for the period from december   through june   the “covenant suspension periods” so that any failure by us to

index to financial statements in consideration of the initial suspension of the calculation of the maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio for the first amendment we issued  million shares which was equivalent to  percent of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the first amendment closing date to kkr lending partners ii lp and other entities indirectly advised by kkr credit advisers us llc which made them a related party in connection with this transaction we recorded debt covenant suspension charges of approximately  million which represented the fair value of the  million outstanding shares of common stock issued multiplied by the closing stock price on the first amendment closing date in addition we recorded debt extinguishment charges of approximately  million related to the writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with our  term credit agreement in consideration for the third and fourth amendment we paid a

effective january   we are amortizing the amendment fees through the maturity date of the  term loan facility using the effective interest method due to operating losses driven in part by an overall lower volume of work and significant losses on a crosscountry pipeline project in canada combined with our current forecast we did not expect to be in compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio for the period from march   through december   the fifth amendment suspends compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage ratio covenants through june   in addition under the fifth amendment the maximum total leverage ratio will be  to  as of september   and will decrease to  to  as of december   and  to  as of june   and thereafter the minimum interest coverage ratio will be  to  as of september   and will increase to  to  as of december   and  to  as of june   and thereafter the fifth amendment also provides that for

analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and insured against through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program we maintain worldwide master commercial insurance policies written through highlyrated insurers in types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the project management and construction industry these policies cover our property plant equipment and cargo against normallyinsurable risks other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with industry standards for the level of our operations and asset base risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients on other projects “builders all risk insurance” is purchased when deemed necessary all insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level except for certain basic insurance that must be purchased locally to comply with insurance laws the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective in all circumstances or against all hazards an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future our ability to maintain insurance which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable may be affected by events over which we have no control we have been limited in our pursuit of certain larger projects due in part to our current balance sheet and bonding capacity in addition to our other efforts to improve our financial position we are exploring opportunities to partner with other contractors which will enable us to work on these largerscale projects critical accounting policies and estimates revenue a number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue we typically structure contracts as unitprice time and materials fixedprice or cost plus fixed fee we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders extra work variations in the scope of work cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized revenue from unitprice and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned revenue for fixedprice and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method under this method estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs taking into consideration physical completion total estimated costs and thus contract income are impacted by changes in productivity scheduling unit cost of labor subcontracts materials and equipment additionally external factors such as weather client needs client delays in providing permits and approvals labor availability governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project’s completion and thus the estimated amount and  table of contents index to financial statements timing of revenue recognition certain fixedprice and cost plus fixed fee contracts include or are amended to include incentive bonus amounts contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed we do not recognize income on a fixedprice contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete depending upon the nature of the contract if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract the projected loss is recognized in full when determined we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change but not for price associated with that scope change costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the amount is estimable revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on the consolidated balance sheets  revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customercaused changes in contract specifications or design or other customerrelated causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred our operating loss for the years ended december   and  was positively impacted by approximately  million and  million  as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at december   and  respectively these changes in contract estimates are primarily attributed to among other things a reduction in estimated costs for certain individually immaterial projects as they progress to completion the realization of change orders related to work previously performed and other changes in events facts and circumstances during the period in which the estimate was revised valuation of intangible assets our intangible assets with finite lives include customer relationships and trade names the value of customer relationships is estimated using the income approach specifically the excess earnings method the excess earnings method consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships with consideration given to customer contract renewals the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan income taxes and required rates of return the value of trade names is estimated using the relieffromroyalty method of the income approach this approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset we amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straightline basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable for instance a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer among other things may trigger the need for an impairment test of intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value for additional information see note  – intangible assets in item  of this form k for more information valuation of longlived assets longlived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if an evaluation is required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary this evaluation as well as an evaluation of our other intangible assets requires us to make longterm forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review forecasts require assumptions about demand for our services and future market conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value less selling costs of such asset and its carrying value such expense would be reflected in earnings  table

ultimate liability for claims incurred including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported with assistance from thirdparty actuaries for these claims to the extent we have insurance coverage above the deductible amounts we have recorded a receivable reflected in “other longterm assets” in our consolidated balance sheets  these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due

facts and historical trends income taxes the financial accounting standards board’s standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in the determination of our valuation allowance and adjust the amount of such allowance if necessary the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings the provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed profit rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects we record reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts the

subsidiaries were sold in  use of estimates – the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states and include certain estimates and assumptions made by management of the company in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  these estimates and assumptions relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the period significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting including estimates of progress towards completion and estimates of gross profit or loss accrual on contracts in progress tax accruals and certain other accrued liabilities quantification of amounts recorded for contingencies valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred income tax assets and the carrying amount of property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes relevant

significant accounting policies continued reclassifications – certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation these reclassifications primarily relate to the impact of the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements during the year commitments and contingencies – liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims assessments litigation fines penalties and other sources are recorded when management assesses that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated recoveries of costs from third parties which management assesses as being probable of realization are recorded as “other longterm assets” in the consolidated balance sheets  legal costs incurred in connection with matters relating to contingencies are expensed in the period incurred see note  – contingencies commitments and other circumstances for more information accounts receivable – most of the accounts receivable and contract work in progress are from clients in the oil gas refinery petrochemical and power industries in north america trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest most contracts require payments as the projects progress or in certain cases advance payments the company generally does not require collateral but in most cases can place liens against the property plant or equipment constructed or terminate the contract if a material default occurs the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company’s best estimate of the probable amount of credit losses in the company’s existing accounts receivable a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables relevant assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer and prior collection history balances over  days past due are reviewed individually for collectability account balances are charged off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection are exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote the allowance requirements are based on the most current facts available and are reevaluated and adjusted on a regular basis and as additional information is received inventories – inventories consisting primarily of parts and supplies are stated at the lower of actual cost or market parts and supplies are evaluated at least annually and adjusted for excess and obsolescence no excess or obsolescence allowances existed at december   or   property plant and equipment – property plant and equipment is stated at cost depreciation including amortization of capital leases is provided on the straightline method using estimated lives as follows   construction equipment    years furniture and equipment    years buildings    years transportation equipment    years marine equipment    years leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized within “operating expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations for the period normal repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred significant renewals and betterments are capitalized the company depreciates assets based on their estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition using the straightline method depreciation and amortization related to operating activities is included in “contract costs” and depreciation and amortization related to general and administrative activities is included in “general and administrative” expense in the consolidated statements of operations  “contract costs” and “general and administrative” expenses are included within “operating expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations  further amortization of assets under capital lease obligations is included in depreciation expense longlived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if an evaluation is required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary this  table of contents index to financial statements willbros group inc notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies continued evaluation as well as an evaluation of our other intangible assets requires the company to make longterm forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company’s services and future market conditions estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and the company’s projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value less selling costs of such asset and its carrying value such expense would be reflected in earnings intangible assets – the company’s intangible assets with finite lives include customer relationships and trade names the value of customer relationships is estimated using the income approach specifically the excess earnings method the excess earnings method consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships with consideration given to customer contract renewals the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to the company’s business plan income taxes and required rates of return the value of trade names is estimated using the relieffromroyalty method of the income approach this approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset the company amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straightline basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable for instance a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer among other things may trigger the need for an impairment test of intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value revenue – a number of factors relating to the company’s business affect the recognition of contract revenue the company typically structures contracts as unitprice time and materials fixedprice or cost plus fixed fee the company believes that its operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders extra work variations in the scope of work cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized revenue from unitprice and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned revenue for fixedprice and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method under this method estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs taking into consideration physical completion total estimated costs and thus contract income are impacted by changes in productivity scheduling unit cost of labor subcontracts materials and equipment additionally external factors such as weather client needs client delays in providing permits and approvals labor availability governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project’s completion and thus the estimated amount and timing of revenue recognition certain fixedprice and cost plus fixed fee contracts include or are amended to include incentive bonus amounts contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed the company does not recognize income on a fixedprice contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete depending upon the nature of the contract if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract the projected loss is recognized in full when determined the company considers unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which the company has customer approval for scope change but not for price associated with that scope change costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred the company recognizes revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the amount is estimable revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in “contract cost and recognized income not yet billed” on the consolidated balance sheets  revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers the company considers claims to be amounts that the company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for customercaused changes in contract specifications or design or other customerrelated causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims which in some instances may not occur  table of contents index to financial statements willbros group inc notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies continued until after completion of work under the contract costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred the companys operating loss for the years ended december   and  was positively impacted by approximately  million and  million  as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at december   and  respectively these changes in contract estimates are primarily attributed to among other things a reduction in estimated costs for certain individually immaterial projects as they progress to completion the realization of change orders related to work previously performed and other changes in events facts and circumstances during the period in which the estimate was revised insurance – the company is insured for workers’ compensation employer’s liability auto liability and general liability claims subject to a deductible of  million per occurrence additionally the company’s largest nonunion employeerelated health care benefit plan is subject to a deductible of  million per claimant per year losses are accrued based upon the company’s estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported with assistance from thirdparty actuaries for these claims to the extent insurance coverage is above the deductible amounts the company has recorded a receivable reflected in “other longterm assets” in the consolidated balance sheets  these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors including the severity of an injury the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends income taxes – the financial accounting standards board “fasb” standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards including federal and state net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in a particular tax jurisdiction during the periods in which the use of such net operating losses are allowed the company considers future taxable income including the impacts of reversing taxable temporary differences future forecasted income and available tax planning strategies when evaluating whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized prior to

price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance fair value hierarchy the fasb’s standard on fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement this standard establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  – observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities level  – unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities there were no transfers

rationalizing our cost structure to address a continuing tight refining market and integrating infrastrux after the expected close in the second quarter the combination with infrastrux presents us with multiple cross selling opportunities to both grow our gas infrastructure activity and expand our integrated service offering to the electric transmission and distribution markets we continue to expect our contract awards to improve throughout  and we are experiencing an increase in inquiries in our engineering units in both the upstream and downstream oil  gas segments we believe recent awards and rising steel and end product prices support our view that we are at or near the bottom of the cycle for our industry our diversified service offerings and breadth of geographic market coverage should enable us to grow both our top line and earnings going forward also a key differentiator for willbros is our international experience and our ability to redeploy our resources to the

approximately  percent of backlog was recurring services contracts infrastrux acquisition the infrastrux acquisition is anticipated to close in the second quarter willbros management believes the combination with infrastrux will accelerate growth objectives and improve visibility due to a high level of recurring services increased diversity and crossselling opportunities randy harl president and chief executive officer explained “infrastrux generates about  percent of its revenue from master service agreements msa’s and these agreements are the product of long and deep relationships of over  years with certain customers in addition to the recurring annual revenue generated by msa’s bid work for these same customers also benefits from a high win rate due to familiarity with their systems and requirements and knowledge of execution costs on their systems we also believe the opportunity to gain scale and capability for the anticipated increase in construction of electric transmission projects through leveraging the texas competitive renewable energy zones “crez” a large electric transmission project assignments for oncor is analogous to our recent experience developing large diameter pipeline construction capability in the period prior to  to prepare for the robust buildout of pipeline infrastructure this should position us in combination with our project management and engineering skill sets to competitively address the anticipated  billion market for large electric transmission projects additionally infrastrux’s pittsburghbased operations position us to deliver our combined service capability to address the developing marcellus shale and further support our alliance agreement with nisource the pending acquisition of infrastrux is a result of the implementation of our strategy which we have been communicating over the past three years” guidance van welch chief financial officer updated earnings guidance for  “in our march earnings call we projected willbros annualized revenue between  billion to  billion with associated annualized earnings between  and  cents per diluted share which excluded any infrastrux deal cost we now estimate

operations of  per share van will discuss the results in more detail but i would like to note that a significant portion of the loss was attributable to retaining key personnel and equipment in anticipation of starting the fayetteville express pipeline project fep additionally we incurred costs associated with the pursuit of growth opportunities particularly the acquisition of infrastrux while we expected and communicated a slow start to  we are also beginning to see the expected significant rampup in the second quarter as we moved into the construction phase on fep and continue executing turnaround services in our downstream segment         we entered  in a strong financial position which enabled us to advance our strategy of transforming willbros into a company of greater scale and diversity with exposure to new end markets and geographies consistent with this strategy we announced the acquisition of infrastrux which we expect to close during the second quarter of  infrastrux gains us exposure to the power endmarket where they typically deliver recurring maintenance and            willbros group inc moderator michael collier  am ct confirmation   page        construction services through master service agreements msas which generate approximately  of their revenue the combination with infrastrux also expands our natural gas capabilities closer to the wellhead and into the marcellus shale play through infrastrux strong pittsburghbased operations additionally we can now translate our experience delivering recurring maintenance and lifecycle improvement services necessary to maintain and operate complex hydrocarbon transportation and processing facilities to the electric transmission and distribution market in addition to the recurring annual revenue generated by msas we are also well positioned for bid work for these same customers due to our familiarity with their systems and requirements and our knowledge of execution costs on their systems which we have gained from working closely with them in certain instances for more than  years       we also believe infrastrux is uniquely positioned to scale its electric transmission capabilities in advance of an anticipated significant national buildout by leveraging its crez assignments for oncor we see many similarities here to our experience developing large diameter pipeline construction capability in the period prior to  to prepare for the robust buildout of pipeline infrastructure we believe the addition of our project management and engineering skills to the infrastrux service offering will enhance our ability to capitalize on the anticipated  billionplus major electric transmission construction market         the pending acquisition of infrastrux also expands our opportunities and geographic presence in the us pipeline construction market as our two companies provide different yet complementary services infrastrux generates about one third of its revenue through construction of small diameter natural gas pipelines in the gathering transmission and distribution markets and has a strong presence in the northeast including the marcellus shale region this small pipe capability coupled with our engineering and project management services enables us to offer full epc solutions for virtually all unconventional major gas resources in north america our alliance with nisource can now benefit from the addition of infrastrux construction services in the marcellus            willbros group inc moderator michael collier  am ct confirmation   page        shale region where nisource has a strong presence and is teaming with others to provide natural gas gathering processing and transmission services for expected increases in production       we expect to highlight the nisource and oncor alliance agreements as models to the industry for the value we can uniquely deliver through our lifecycle focus capabilities our ability to offer our customers via these relationships will become increasingly apparent allowing us to replicate this model across industries and geographies         a key competitive differentiator for us in developing these alliances is our ability to provide early stage engineering services which traditionally also serve as a leading indicator for our construction services we now see positive signs in both our upstream and downstream engineering activities and have begun selective hiring to meet project demands these engineering services combined with our specialty construction capabilities enable us to offer full epc services and differentiate us from our competitors         the excess of large diameter pipeline construction capacity has created a highly competitive environment for the larger projects in the united states as a result we are expanding our focus on the expected surge of both shorter distance largediameter pipeline projects and smalldiameter pipeline projects for interconnects and laterals in this market we continue to maintain strict discipline in our bidding process and we will not submit a bid nor accept a project that does not meet our bidding pricing criteria despite robust competition we believe this market provides many of the most tangible synergy opportunities with infrastrux additionally tight contracting conditions in north america highlight a key differentiator for willbros — the experience and capability gained from  years of execution in  different countries to deploy our resources to the most attractive markets worldwide we continue to prudently pursue international pipeline construction and professional services opportunities in north africa and the middle east while also pursuing epc opportunities associated with proposed export pipelines for lng liquefaction            willbros group inc moderator michael collier  am ct confirmation   page        plants in queensland australia we have submitted proposals for multiple projects and having been shortlisted remain confident that we will secure new work in australia       in canada higher stable oil prices are driving renewed activity in the oil sands and once stalled projects are restarting we are seeing increasing opportunities for our field services fabrication and construction units additionally our strategy to expand our downstream services into the canadian market is gaining traction and we have been awarded our first api storage tank project we continue to increase our share of the chrome carbide overlay cco market we have recently completed and qualified new automatic straightrun and elbow overlay machinery and completed the construction of a new  square foot fabrication facility bringing our total shop capacity to  square feet we can now address the current and expected future demand for fabricated pipe spools api storage tanks fired heaters furnaces equipment modules and mining equipment fabrication and repair the new machinery and shop capacity will give us the ability to triple current annual revenues from this business unit our canadian pipeline assets were idle during the first quarter of  due to reduced levels of bid activity in  we were hopeful that a project where we had a letter of intent would proceed but it was delayed due to permitting issues we expect this project to move forward during the winter construction season of  and ‘ canadian pipeline bidding activity has improved and we are pursuing projects that are scheduled to begin execution later this summer and into the traditional construction season         in oman we are encouraged by a return to a market that emphasizes quality safety and schedule certainty as opposed to lowest price as the dominant buying factor as a result we are regaining market share we lost in  and are optimistic that we will see growth in oman         in the downstream segment we’re seeing evidence of what may be the beginning of recovery in this market with increased refinery utilization improved refining margins and some new announcements of renewed capital spending in our wink engineering business resource          willbros group inc moderator michael collier  am ct confirmation   page        utilization has improved and for the first time since the acquisition we are adding staff we are also seeing an increase in project inquiry levels including epc projects         we continue to invest in our government services business and the task order flow from our navfac contract remains robust we are optimistic we will participate in a similar contract vehicle with the united states army corps of engineers         van will now discuss our first quarter financial results van     van welch   thanks randy and good morning everyone for the first quarter of this year we reported a net loss from continuing operations of  million or  per share on revenue of  million this compares to a net loss of  million or  per share on revenue of  million during the fourth quarter of  the revenue decline is primarily attributable to a  million reduction in our us construction facilities revenue a  million drop in canada maintenance and fabrication activities and continuing weakness in the downstream segment particularly with respect to small capital projects         as we anticipated we have performed very little pipeline construction activity in the past two quarters our decision to retain key assets and people is expected to result in improved performance and productivity to execute the fep project which is currently underway our recent safety milestone of achieving  million manhours without a recordable incident is a testimony to the quality and dedication of our fep spread crews and we believe this safety performance will correlate strongly with positive project results downstream turnaround activity did increase quarter over quarter but a delay in one project under contract reduced utilization of these resources for the quarter below our previous expectations additionally one construction services project experienced scope changes which are currently being negotiated the  million in costs associated with these changes are reflected in first quarter results as a matter of policy we do not recognize change order revenue until it is approved            willbros group inc moderator michael collier  am ct confirmation   page        consistent with our growth strategy we continue to invest in future business opportunities many of which are in developmental stages and are expected to provide satisfactory returns in the future in our upstream segment higher international proposal costs mainly related to the joint venture opportunities in australia have favorably positioned us to compete for over  billion in near term project awards our investment in establishing a presence in libya where changes in government policy have enabled longdelayed projects to attract capital and resources is expected to begin generating initial revenue in the third quarter         in our downstream segment we are successfully expanding our government services offering recent awards are increasing the scale of this business and we expect to be profitable before the end of the year our investment in leveraging our downstream capabilities into the oil sands market has resulted in our first api storage tank award in canada and we expect our heater services to benefit from increasing development of steam assisted gravity drainage sagd projects last july’s wink acquisition to date has not been profitable however improvement in refinery utilization and crack spreads coupled with our increased personnel utilization and increasing bid activity is encouraging going forward we are expecting wink to return to profitable performance in the second half of the year         we expect these investments to generate positive returns as global economic improvements continue allowing us to appropriately scale and grow these opportunities         i will now provide first quarter  financial results by operating segment         during the first quarter of  our upstream segment generated an operating loss of  million on revenue on  million as compared to a fourth quarter operating loss of  million on revenue of  million the revenue decline in the first quarter was a result of lower levels            willbros group inc moderator michael collier  am ct confirmation   page        of facilities work and the absence of pipeline construction projects in north america resulting in underutilization of assets and resources       with the mobilization of the fep project utilization for our us construction assets will increase throughout the next two quarters which we anticipate will result in greatly improved financial performance again as randy stated we are also optimistic about the uptick in demand for our upstream engineering which we believe is a precursor to increased construction activity         with respect to the transcanada facility project and our unpaid receivable of  million outside counsel has evaluated the contract and agreed that our contractual position on this cost reimbursable project is strong we have taken the appropriate actions to protect our contractual position but our preference remains to amicably work with transcanada a valuable client to obtain a mutually acceptable resolution         our downstream segment generated an operating loss of  million on revenue of  million compared to the fourth quarter operating loss of  million on revenue of  million         the sequential quarter
