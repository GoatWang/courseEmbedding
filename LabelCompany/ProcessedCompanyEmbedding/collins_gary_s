supplements on amazon or ebay a mustread by former fda special agent gary collins  primal power method created by former fda special agent gary collins freeshippingonall orders why you should never buy supplements on amazon or ebay a mustread by former fda special agent gary collins posted august   by gary collins ms all supplement product references in comments will now be x’d out as too many idiots are trying to promote their products this way you have to love product troll’s get a life and real job for that matter also please do not send me questions asking if the supplements you regularly use are any good or not there are thousands of supplement manufacturers so honestly most of the time i have no idea if supplement x that i have never heard of before is good or not in today’s difficult economy everyday folks seeking a healthandenergy boost may be hesitant to purchase “expensive” vitamins and supplements from “upscale” stores and distribution outlets instead honest folks turn to internet sites such as amazon and ebay to purchase vitamins on the cheap for themselves and their kids i urge you don’t do this emphasis added as a former special agent and forensic investigator for the us food and drug administration fda my heart breaks for hardworking moms and dads trying to do right by their family by buying inexpensive supplements little do they know that these “bargain” vitamins and capsules are worthless at best and at worst may cost them and their children their health and possibly their lives the fact is it costs money to make quality dietary supplements such as vitamins protein powders fish oil capsules energy bars herbal blends or sports nutrition products but if you have no morals and know how truly underregulated the supplement industry is in america you can make huge amounts of money selling dangerous counterfeit and expired supplement products how you undercut the price of legitimate supplement companies cheaper wins and the consumer loses why should you believe me for many years not too long ago i worked in the food and drug administration fda and us department of health and human services hhs as a special agent i’ve been behind the curtain of the supplement industry – way behind – so what i say is not based on some farfetched conspiracy theory i was there and witnessed it firsthand now as a public health advocate and creator of the primal power method here’s what i want you to know about the vitamins capsules and pills that can make or break your health there are three main ways that supplements end up on the market at unbelievably cheap prices they are counterfeit and probably dangerous they are useless expired products that have been repackaged as new they are stolen products released on the black market without any quality control here’s how each scenario plays out counterfeit products one of the easiest ways to make a dishonest buck in the supplement world is to create a pill that mirrors a namebrand health supplement create lookalike packaging and you can sell your worthless pill on the internet for a “discounted” price and a counterfeit operation is born people would be appalled if they knew how prevalent counterfeit dietary supplements truly are sadly fake vitamins and “health” capsules have made their way into the general consumer market these dangerous pills masquerade as the real thing on the shelves of the namebrand department stores that virtually every family in america patronizes – and they certainly are available on the internet here’s the bottom line if an aboveboard supplement or pharmaceutical drug is popular you can bet someone primarily in china or india is counterfeiting it i’m not saying this as some offthewall scare tactic i was there and this was my job still don’t believe me here is a recent article by a major news network backing up what i say regarding amazon selling counterfeit items and destroying businesses who created the product httpswwwyahoocomfinancenewsamazoncounterfeitsputmansbusinesshtml even worse fake pills virtually never have the correct amount of the active ingredient they are supposed to contain during my fda tenure we ran lab tests on all kinds of lookalike pills and capsules some cheapcounterfeit supplements had ten times or more the amount of “medicinal” ingredients as was indicated on the label worse some had none and others simply contained large amounts of sawdust criminals are not moral but they are often smart they not only counterfeit health supplements but also all of the paperwork that goes along with them they have numerous distribution shell companies set up all over the world so it is almost impossible to figure out the paperwork trail and the actual origins of these dangerous pills trust me i’ve been paid to untangle this kind of web many times the realworld result is that there are virtually no legal consequences to selling fake pills capsules or vitamins and the criminals know it how prevalent are fake supplements the iacc international anticounterfeiting coalition estimates that brandholders the legitimate companies behind namebrand noncounterfeit products lose approximately  billion of revenue annually because of counterfeiting michael danel the secretary general of the world customs organization has said that if terrorism did not exist counterfeiting would be the most significant criminal act of the early twentyfirst century that’s why it is so important to buy directly from a legitimate manufacturer or from a trusted health practitionerwhenever you can read the labels on the pills you buy call the customer service number and ask a few questions many companies will only give vague uneducated answers about the contents of their products and the nature of a product’s manufacturing processes frankly a lot of internet pillpushers won’t even list a phone number or address online not good bottom line if it seems fake it probably is and if it’s really cheap it’s almost certainly a counterfeit get your supplements from the most trusted source in the industry expired products  another way to make a dishonest living is to purchase a genuine product that has expired for pennies on the dollar change the dates on the package labels and voila a cheap “new” product ready to be brought back to market legitimate supplement companies often have fire sales when they have products that are about to expire the counterfeiters love this as it fits right into their business model they can purchase these legitimate products and package them with counterfeit products and no one is the wiser i have seen this done in a couple ways the criminals might simply replace the label with a new label and a fictitious expiration date or if they received the expired product in raw form not in the bottle they will sometimes mix it with counterfeit tablets or capsules bottom line if criminals can make a couple bucks on something they will it all boils down to money and by purchasing expired legitimate products they can have “genuine” product on hand if something goes wrong and someone complains once again it’s the consumer who will pay the price stolen products resold by criminal enterprises this scheme is pretty straightforward criminals simply break into the warehouses of an aboveboard supplement company or take the big rig truck transporting nutritional products by force they then distribute the product to other criminal fencing enterprises and the supplements end up on the internet at a supercheap price alternatively employees of a genuine supplement company might steal product while at work and then sell it on the black market to criminals you may think well in this case it’s a genuine supplement so why should i care here’s why criminals don’t just work with stolen products but with expired and counterfeit products as well they all get mixed together so you as the consumer will never know which variation of the product you are getting you may get lucky one time another time you may not be so lucky is it really worth your health to save a couple of bucks absolutely not buying safe supplements  when i created the primal power method my vision was to create a company beyond reproach so i personally vet each and every product that i sell for legitimacy and quality i currently only sell the primal power method supplement line on my website as i work extremely hard to make sure you have the best products possible in order to do that i feel at this time it is best only i control the sale of the primal power method product line if i ever decide to sell my supplements using other sales channels i will definitely make sure to list who they are on this website readers of my book the primal power method change your body change your life the modern caveman lifestyle simplified will be familiar with what i call my “rules” for purchasing pills the book talks about this subject indepth as well as which supplements your body actually needs for now here are four of my most important tips – only buy directly from the producermanufacturer of the supplement when shopping on amazon amazon is the largest place for counterfeit and illegitimate companies to sell their products some people have confused what i have said to mean that you should never buy from a legitimate company that makes a high quality supplement and lists it on amazon this is not the case just make sure it is the actual manufacturer and not some scammer using a similar company name but the article i linked to earlier in this post proves it is hard to to tell at times if it is the actual company that created the product or some shady scammer using all their information – only buy supplements from a reputable company do your research and check them out if the website is based in a foreign country and has no contact information or customer service number there is a good chance this is a company involved in nefarious activities believe me these companies exist and we are talking about your health and possibly your life – find out what standards are used to test the quality of the ingredients and the final products of the supplement companies you want to patronize reputable companies will have an informative label on their supplements and will have more information about their testing measures on their website – if it is cheap avoid it no reputable company using highquality ingredients can manufacture highend supplements cheaply it just isn’t possible don’t waste your money another insider fact health practitioners who sell supplements such as a chiropractor doctor or dietician… or my company are only allowed to sell practitionergrade supplements at the manufacturer’s suggested retail price msrp or at a maximum of fifteen percent off of the msrp depending on the company basically we all sign legal agreements that we will not discount the products on our website this is pretty common practice to protect legitimate supplement companies with this insider information you can protect your family as well what my fda experience taught me the sad truth is that fakepillpushing criminals often operate in countries at a distance far further than the arm of uncle sam’s laws can reach it’s easy to sell counterfeit supplements at reputable online venues such as amazon and ebay but for the consumer it’s a disaster here’s what a decade of forensic investigation really taught me your instincts are usually right if you can’t easily trace the origins of some “miracle” pills or are given the runaround by a supplement sales rep when you ask complex questions about ingredients or packaging your gut will tell you what’s up go with your gut times are tough in america but i urge you not to save dollars buy buying deeply discounted supplements on amazon or other discount third party websites without doing some serious research risking the health of your family and children is not worth it instead buy high quality supplements eat nutritious food and get some exercise that’s the only real way to beat the criminals and achieve lifelong health get your primal power method

they have an agreement with i learned they could not give me that info however they could tell me i could get their products through their distributors pureformulas and professional supplement center this seems to answer your question on how pureformulas can sell “practitioner only” products at least when it comes to xxxxxx products reply gary collins ms october th  first i want to start by saying i will be blocking out supplement company names in peoples responses as i’m having a harder and harder time deciphering who is honestly posting a response or trying to backdoor promote their product thanks for the info jill as it brings up many red flags in the company you have been buying your supplements from the fact they wouldn’t provide any practitioners in your area or even have a list on their website kind of tells me what they are all about they sound like a typical health scam company there is a huge amount of supposed “practitioner only” supplement companies that actually sell consumer level supplements but actually label them as practitioner only as a way to double or triple the price why create a practitioner only line then have a supposed “distributor” who then sell to the general public at usually a big discount makes absolutely no sense and smells like dog crap to me matter of fact i have stopped recommending most practitioner only supplement companies because i feel a lot of them are pretty shady i don’t trust pureformulas as far as i can throw them i remember years ago when they first popped up they claimed to be a small mom and pop shop but they had thousands of sku’s kind of hard for a small mom and pop shop to have thousands of sku’s and from what i could tell a very large warehouse i also found numerous products pictures that appeared to be counterfeit to me the final red flag is their location which is the hub of the counterfeit prescription drug and supplement rings in the country i should know i used to investigate them i would warn and discourage people from purchasing supplements from these so called “distributors” again best to buy directly from the product company when possible or your local health food store the primary reason which is horrible business model i only sell my supplement line on my own website is that way i can  control my product once i let other people or companies start selling my products i no longer no what is going on and what is actually my product or some cheap andor dangerous counterfeit reply judy july th  thank you gary this article was a real eye opener so it sounds like on the one hand you are saying buy directly from mfg but that one can also buy from amazon that brand are you saying you can buy a brand name from amazon and it is legit i sometimes get brands like bioastin astaxanthin that have a white shipping label covering important info on the back of the product it says it’s mfg’ed in hawaii which it should be but i’m not sure what about whole foods…they are generally good at sourcing products aren’t they very discouraging to learn this the article drew me to your site as i googled this topic but i will check out your products too again thanks reply gary collins ms july th  thanks i’m one of the few people in this country who was on the inside and truly understands how the underbelly of the health world really works what i was saying that is there are now many legitimate companies that sell health products on amazon you still have to do your homework but if you have bought from the company prior and now they have a store on amazon you should be ok to be honest i’m no longer a big fan of whole foods and do not shop at any of their stores they have proven to be very shady and greatly overcharge for the products they carry the safest way is to always purchase directly from the manufacturer but that usually means you will pay full retail you have to decide if the safety of your health is worth a couple extra bucks or not that is a question you have to answer for yourself i cannot answer that for you reply daniel morris may nd  hi gary do you suspect this carries over to simple health supplements as well such as emergenc i know vitamin c supplements are pretty much bs but the placebo effect keeps my wife so happy she swears by it so whatever — i’d just rather not have her save  bucks on ebay for  little packs of expired sawdust reply gary collins ms may nd  it applies to all products if it is popular it is being counterfeited during my investigations i saw counterfeit crest toothpaste heinz catsup campbell’s soup about every popular supplement made to give you some examples i would rather pay a little extra and get it in the store or at least buy it directly from the manufacturer if possible reply anton june th  i know your based in the us i am in the uk it seems due to lack of proper terminology i am unable to find a chem testing kit to test for the presence of bcaa’s and glutamine could you perhaps refer me to a site or give me the proper terminology regarding the name of such a test kit so i can do this my self as each and every single time i order something the seal that should remain in place when you unscrew the cap for the very st time is stuck to the lid and does not make the crack sound it should upon breaking said seal i don’t need to test how much is in it all i need to know if there is any of the bcaa’s andor glutamine in it cheers reply gary collins ms june th  sorry i don’t know of any kit like that usually you have to have it sent to a lab reply rize kart may st  i really like this blog thanks for giving us a great information reply patricia hagen april nd  i am looking to buy magnesium citrate the official name is pure encapsulations magnesium citrate because of the similar name i thought that pureformulas was the name of the company do you still see red flags re pureformulas thank you reply gary collins ms april nd  i wouldn’t purchase anything from pure formulas they are a very shady company the brand you are looking at is supposed to be sold by healthcare practitioners only as required by the contract you enter with them as a healthcare practitionerreseller that is why i started selling my own supplement line all the practitioner grade products i sold were all over the internet for much cheaper than i sold them and not being sold by healthcare practitioners who knows where they are getting these products from but my guess is a lot of them are cheap counterfeits so buyer beware if you want healthcare practitioner gradestrength supplements you should get them from a healthcare practitioner this is the same as buying prescription drugs off the internet without a prescription from a source usually overseas you do not know not very smart reply lee mclaughlin april th  hello gary i would like to know if you have or sell some sort of protein supplement that comes in a pill form the shakes that come all ready to drink is costly the powders are costly as well and often wonder if the ingredients are accurate and valid i know they make a pill form because i have seem them before on ebay and amazon although i don’t know if they sell them to usa customers i also do not trust those websites as well so if you or one of your personal colleagues have the time i would appreciate some feedback and or advice sincerely lee mclaughlin leemclaughlinaolcom us zip code  reply gary collins ms april th  hey lee there are some protein capsules out there but i would not recommend them here is why they contain very little complete protein so for bang for your buck a high quality protein powder is still the best way to go as i say in this article be very careful purchasing supplements on amazon and you should never buy supplements off of ebay period i carry high quality protein powders that i think are affordable to most and are of the highest quality to include usda organic httpwwwprimalpowermethodcomproductcategorysupplements reply omara february th  hi gary i ve brought vitamin for hair grow from amazon since i taking it my hair get worse fall out like crazy and there’s no batch number or costumer phone do you think is fake now i can see my scalp i am really saddo i have to stop taking it i really want this to work on my hair in stead is opposite the name of vitamin is head high thanks reply gary collins ms february th  i have no idea as i do not know the company i would stop taking and contact the company if they have no way to contact them that should tell you all you need to know reply diane february st  i recently received my supply of mucinex allergy medication which is no longer sold over the counter where i used to buy i ordered from amazon and not for a lower cost it was expensive but i was happy to find it when i received it clear as day …a  day supply which would last me probably a year the medication expires in only  month of the day i got it i hesitate to send it back so that no one else gets this same expired med…but clearly i want my reimbursement of  how sad is it that we get used to the convenience of the internet but can’t trust it no matter how reputable a company sounds reply elke drutschel august nd  i have read the information and insider details on your website with great interest i am wondering if you also have any knowledge on pet supplements i have been purchasing a liver supplement for my dog denamarin for several years it can not be bought from the manufacturer directly a lot of different websites offer the supplement though at hugely different prices how can i tell which products are legit thank you for all the enlightening work you do reply gary collins ms august nd  i have ran into the same problem myself when it comes to pet supplements recently i found the natural ear cleaner i use on my black lab for half the price on the internet that i usually purchased it for at the pet store it was a huge red flag for me and i asked the pet store where i usually purchase it if it was realistic for it to be sold for that low of a price as i figured they said no in addition the label looked different on the cheaper brand which is usually a dead giveaway it is an inferior counterfeit product the best way is to by it from a local pet store or from their online site if they have one that way if your pet has a reaction you can return it to the brick and mortar store one last way is to check with the manufacturer if they have a list of resellers that they wholesale to if the website or company where you found it is not listed definitely don’t buy if from them thanks gary reply cristina april th  hi … what do you think about whole foods market or new season  i ordered some prenatal vitamins from “life garden company” from amazon but when i saw ur website i canceled everything  cause i’m scared … can u give me some good advice where to buy good organic no gmo vitamins  please reply gary collins ms april th  whole foods is a good place but you will usually pay a premium i have never heard of new season so i can’t comment on that store chain i have heard this primal power method company sells good supplements made by a guy with a pretty impressive background just saying 🙂 reply ashley april th  is it safe to buy my vitamins from places like walgreens or walmart reply gary collins ms april th  hey ashley i would rather you not purchase vitamins from places like walgreens or walmart for two reasons  i would rather have you support a local small business which is better for your local economy  you will usually get much better service from a small local health store and they will be much more knowledgeable about the products they carry reply cynthia december th  what about websites like vitacost iherb and pureformulas are the legit reply gary collins ms december th  hey cynthia i get a ton of emails people asking what online retailers are legit and what ones aren’t there are so many and the fact the big ones are changing inventory and their sources of products it is definitely a moving target i would stay away from pureformulas i researched them a couple years back and there was a lot of red flags popping up they sell a lot of practitioner only products meaning you have to be a practitioner to sell them to your client and last time i checked they were nothing but a supplement warehouse so how are they getting “practitioner only” products i always recommend people support their local small businesses when they can you get to look the person straight in the eye who is selling and recommending the product a lot of them will also have websites like myself but unlike the big online warehouse sellers we get our products from trusted sources and stick with that source reply leave a reply click here
