k john rynd ceo of hercules offshore calls it like he sees it  years spent at rowan  at noble and now almost  at the helm of hercules offshore have given him a unique perspective and unparalleled expertise on the gulf of mexico shallow water market heres  high points he covered regarding the state of offshore drilling yesterday keep in mind that hercules offshore is primarily a gom jackup driller  for the first time we cant nail supply in the jackup market we just dont know the builders anymore john rynd for the first time in my career i have a very limited sense of where new supply really is in terms of status  intent  outlook and thats driven by the orderbook over the last nine months in china if you go through the list of whats being ordered just about half of the newbuilds now are in china and the ownership we just dont know them we dont know who they are usually in our business we know whos ordering also theyre ordering some rig designs that have not been built before in yards that have not built rigs before im not saying these rigs are not going to get built but when you try to get your handle on when are they truly going to hit the market whos going to run them whos going to ultimately own them—those kind of questions—it makes trying to figure out the supply side of our equation very tough to get your arms around so its a unique period i think in the jackup business where we cant nail supply i mean historically weve been able to nail supply  can the jackup market absorb all the newbuilds john rynd well i think that you kind of tell me where commodity prices are going to be and where yearoveryear spending growth is and i could probably solve a pretty good answer i do think its going to stay relatively healthy if the commodity prices stay relatively healthy demand is still growing internationally youre just seeing the demand in deepwater kind of slide to the right were not seeing that yet at all in the jackup market as i mentioned were working on  years of work just for two rigs and thats not even counting the rest of the work were working on internationally on the tender so the tendering activity is still very robust  alls well in the gom jackup market john rynd today the balance between demand and supply of jackup rigs in the us gulf of mexico remains healthy during the first quarter we were able to keep most of our rigs under contract and on the payroll excluding scheduled shipyard downtime we only had approximately one month of contracted rig days across our  marketed rig fleet or said another way this downtime represented less than  of our available days for the quarter pricing in the gulf of mexico remained stable all of our new contracts and extensions executed since the beginning of the year have been priced at leadingedge dayrates and i expect stable pricing under the current supplydemand environment we are also starting to see some of the customers that stepped away from the market late last year reengage one of the big end users of jackups fieldwood which brought the shallow water gulf of mexico assets of apache as well as sandridge has had what we believe to be a temporary reduction in rig demand as they digest these acquisitions once they get their internal resource planning completed i think fieldwood can be a more active customer than what they are running today currently fieldwood has three jackups under contract across the region at this time last year its predecessor companies ran seven rigs  ma in the jackup market is coming—targets include new legacy jackup contractors and speculative newbuilds john rynd the industry needs to further consolidate now with shelf drilling and the noble spin paragon those are the obvious candidates as you look around to the legacy assets around the world timing is always tough to dictate i think people are going to gravitate probably first to the supply of rigs coming and about over half of the new rigs being built today are being built in china and about twothirds of those roughly are built by just pure investors that dont have any drilling experience so i think thats going to be the interesting thing to really pay attention to as we go into   the established drillers are starting to do some due diligence on chinese newbuilds evaluating potential acquisition opportunities john rynd wed have to do a lot more diligence than weve done already we made a round through china third quarter last year to the various yards weve got a sense of rigs coming out of certain yards that we would look hard at and at this point without a lot more diligence therere yards that we would be less likely to look hard but again it requires more diligence on our part these comments were made in hercules offshores first quarter earnings
