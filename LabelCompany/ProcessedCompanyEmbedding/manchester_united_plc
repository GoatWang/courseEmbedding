separated by commas message  required fields find out who shone and who was shocking during the glamour friendly in california california dreaming manchester united celebrate against real madrid all getty preseason’s battles are not only fought between opposing teams but by teammates as they scrap for starting spots when the real action gets under way this was the case on sunday night as manchester united edged a frankly appalling penalty shootout against real madrid in california’s levi’s stadium following a  draw within  minutes here we review the players who grasped their chance to impress and the ones will need to improve sharpish before  kicks off timothy fosumensah the versatile netherlands youth international did his prospects of carving out more firstteam minutes no harm placed in opposition to gareth bale at rightback for the first half the yearold showcased his usual keen competitiveness but what was most assuring was the presence of composure beyond his years as he kept the wales superstar deathly quiet this had been glaringly absent in the opening  friendly win against la galaxy in which he was brought on as a halftime substitute then removed by  minutes after a number of rash moments as an able backup across the defence or at defensive midfield the ajax youth product looks poised to better his four starts from last term timothy fosumensah achraf hakimi another gem appears to have been mined from madrid’s academy hakimi  curbed the influence of onsong france forward anthony martial during the second half something celebrated spain rightback dani carvajal singularly failed to do during the club’s opening  minutes of preseason the morocco international also exhibited his background as a flying winger with a number of bursts up the pitch with the erratic danilo sold to manchester city expect to see far more of hakimi next season hakimi achraf victor lindelof this has not been the start that the highlyrated sweden international envisaged at united culpable in both la galaxy’s goals on debut his stumbles continued at levi’s stadium with the concession of a comicallybad penalty which ensured ronald mcdonald – who led out the teams – wasn’t the only clown on the pitch the £ million dh million buy from benfica got his timing all wrong as he swept the onrushing theo fernandez into the air like a rag doll with the ball several metres away the demands of playing at the highest level are eluding him at present yet such luminaries as jaap stam endured a similarlysuspect preseason upon his arrival in  before developing into one of the club’s greatestever defenders lindelof and manager jose mournho must hope history repeats itself victor lindelof second left gareth bale it is hard to believe that allpowerful madrid president florentino perez will make it threeconsecutive summers without adding another ‘galactico’ to his collection with monaco’s prodigious striker kylian mbappe believed to be the latest object of his covetous affections something has to give in the ‘bbc’ portugal icon cristiano ronaldo is untouchable while france outcast karim benzema quality was there for all to see last term this is why bale cannot afford the ineffectual displays to mount up despite getting the better of lindelof to win and then convert a penalty he was bossed all too easily by the coltish fosumensah when the vast difference in standing between the players should have made this a onesided contest he will need to be much improved against manchester city on wednesday when madrid play their second warmup fixture
