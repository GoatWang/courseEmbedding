in the hoosier state had risen to such an exalted position in the business world or had enjoyed more the confidence of the political and financial leaders of the nation his course in life was steadily upward the author of a biographical sketch aptly wrote the record of mr parrys life shows that from the time he was fifteen years of age his career has been marked by a series of successes —never of a failure he disclosed from the first selfreliance—obstacles were overcome as they appeared his head and his heart and his hands were always in harmonious alliance under his masterful mind order and system predominated …  inasmuch as we are all the products of our ancestors his success may be ascribed in part to his heredity towards the close of the eighteenth century there lived in wales a civil engineer of uncommon ability named henry parry this man resolved to try his luck in america he accordingly settled in pennsylvania where he followed his occupation during the war of  he is said to have served as an artilleryman afterwards he became a wheelwright and carpenter and built the first courthouse in pennsylvania west of the alleghany mountains according to family records his wife was

that the family settled in indiana until he was sixteen or seventeen years of age david lived on his fathers farm attending school in the winter but also receiving instructions from his mother who apparently was a woman of fine education and superior intelligence as he grew older the boy began to realize that if he were to tie himself to a farm he would get nowhere in life therefore he sought and obtained from his father permission to break loose and strike out for himself the elder parry had faith in his son in  he secured his first real job as a clerk in laurel at 0 a month for two years

wife of warren d oakes of the same city in  thomas j parry experienced financial reverses which left him bankrupt david and edward promptly sold their business and gave the proceeds—0—to their father such acts of filial devotion are more eloquent than words however fitly spoken and d m parry when he surrendered all his savings to relieve his father of debt disclosed the nobility of his nature and designated himself as one who in the lottery of life ought to draw a capital prize from  to  david parry was a traveling salesman for the pappenheimer and ludlow hardware company of cincinnati ohio the next four years he spent as a partner with marion jamison in a hardware firm at rushville indiana in  he sold out his share of the business and planned to sell agricultural implements in south
