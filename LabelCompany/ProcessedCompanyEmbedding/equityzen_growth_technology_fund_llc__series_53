pain facing private company employees and founders investors and former employees that find themselves heavily concentrated in their own companys equity investments in private placements holding preipo companies are speculative illiquid and carry a high degree of risk including loss of principal investments made on the equityzen platform are made through pooled investment vehicles which acquire shares of private technology companies and are not direct investments in these companies we were tired of hearing a recurring story employees held a majority of their net worth in company stock that was both illiquid and hard to value concurrently investors sought exposure to postseed but preipo startups and had nowhere to go for attractive valuations as passionate entrepreneurs and experienced investors facing this issue ourselves we sought to marry two complementary parties equityzen was born in  we provide a secure marketplace that matches shareholder offerings with investor demand through a product that neither adds to shareholder count nor dilutes current investors learn more here our long term goals are to reduce the risk of joining a growing private firm and keep
