alpine immune sciences has acquired nivalis therapeutics  alpine immune sciences no menu assigned alpine immune sciences has acquired nivalis therapeutics alpinenivalis transaction on april   alpine and nivalis announced a transaction combining the companies on july   this transaction was completed with alpine immune sciences inc beginning trading july   on the nasdaq national market under the ticker “alpn” alpine’s primary focus is developing novel protein‐based therapies using our variant immunoglobulin domain vigd™ platform technology the vigd platform is designed to create novel therapeutics that modulate multiple therapeutic targets including many present in the immune synapse our vigds are developed via a unique process known as directed evolution which can produce proteins capable of either enhancing or diminishing an immune response creating a platform applicable to both oncology and inflammatory diseases for more information on alpine’s vigd platform see the our

endogenous snitrosoglutathione gsno plays a critical role in modulating protein function through the transfer of nitric oxide to a protein thiol group or snitrosation although administering gsno directly has shown potential as a therapeutic intervention in preclinical models of cystic fibrosis and other diseases it is limited as a chronic therapy for several reasons including difficulty in formulation and administration depleted gsno levels are believed to contribute to loss of airway function and pathology in cf lung disease due to dysregulated snitrosation the snitrosation of certain proteins has been shown to modulate cftr activity and decrease inflammation in preclinical human airway and animal models of disease these targeted effects have been demonstrated to modify certain molecular chaperones such as hsphsp organizing protein or hop which affect trafficking and stability of the fdel cftr protein gsno concentrations are regulated by gsno reductase gsnor an enzyme that breaks down gsno gsnor through its regulation of gsno levels plays a key role in pulmonary gastrointestinal and cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology the nivalis drug development strategy was

platform focused on developing therapeutics for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer   approximately  million in cash and cash equivalents on balance sheet following transaction close  alpine immune sciences inc nasdaq alpn a leading company focused on the development of proprietary proteinbased immunotherapies to modulate the immune system today announced the closing of its previously disclosed merger with nivalis therapeutics nasdaq nvls effective july   the combined company changed its name to alpine immune sciences inc immediately following the merger and is expected to commence trading on the nasdaq global market today july   under the ticker symbol “alpn” “the completion of this merger represents a significant milestone for alpine immune sciences and its shareholders and most importantly for physicians and their patients seeking a fundamentally new approach to modulate the immune system to fight disease closing the merger in combination with the associated financing provides us with the resources to move forward as a focused wellfunded public company” said chairman and chief executive officer dr mitchell h gold “with our experienced team in place and a potentially transformative development pipeline of first in class molecules we believe that alpine has both the experience and the resources to develop novel therapeutic approaches that address inflammation cancer and other diseases” upon the completion of the merger and financing alpine will have approximately  million in cash and cash equivalents this includes proceeds from a financing that closed immediately prior to the merger in which alpine received gross proceeds of approximately  million in new investment from current alpine investors orbimed advisors frazier healthcare partners and alpine bioventures the continued support from our existing investors in this financing is a strong endorsement of our program’s transformative potential and the scientists at alpine to address some of the most challenging unmet medical needs” said dr gold alpine is focused on the development of innovative immunotherapies alpine’s proprietary variant immunoglobulin domain™ “vigd” platform uses a process known as directed evolution to create therapeutics capable of modulating multiple human immune system proteins in the immune synapse through a single molecule in alpine’s preclinical studies the vigd platform has identified novel proteins with the ability to either enhance or diminish an immune response these proteins could be potentially applicable therapeutically to both oncology cancer and inflammatory diseases alpine has also developed its transmembrane immunomodulatory protein™ “tip”™ technology based on the vigd platform to potentially enhance engineered cellular therapies alpine intends to apply for clearance for its first molecule a dual icoscd antagonist to begin clinical trials in the second half of  following the completion of the merger alpine shareholders option holders and warrant holders own or have rights to acquire approximately  percent of the combined company and former nivalis shareholders option holders and warrant holders own or have rights to acquire approximately  percent of the combined company about alpine immune sciences inc alpine immune sciences inc is focused on developing novel protein‐based immunotherapies using its proprietary variant ig domain vigd platform technology the vigd platform is designed to interact with multiple targets including many present in the immune synapse alpine’s vigds are developed using a process known as directed evolution which can potentially produce proteins capable of either enhancing or diminishing an immune response and thereby may potentially apply therapeutically to both oncology and inflammatory diseases alpine has also developed its tip technology based on the vigd platform to potentially enhance engineered cellular therapies in october

july   this transaction was completed with alpine immune sciences inc beginning trading july   on the nasdaq national market under the ticker “alpn” alpine’s primary focus is developing novel protein‐based therapies using our variant immunoglobulin domain vigd™ platform technology the vigd platform is designed to create novel therapeutics that modulate multiple therapeutic targets including many present in the immune synapse our vigds are developed via a unique process known as directed evolution which can produce proteins capable of either enhancing or diminishing an immune response creating a platform applicable to both oncology and inflammatory diseases for more information on alpine’s vigd platform see the our science page as part of the transaction alpine obtained

therapies designed to preserve intracellular gsno snitrosoglutathione levels gsno is a molecule with cell signaling effects implicated in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis cf and other respiratory diseases nivalis’ lead candidate cavosonstat n was evaluated in a phase  trial in patients with the fdel mutation the most common diseasecausing mutation in cf alpine immune sciences is seeking opportunities to continue the development of cavosonstat n and the nivalis clinical candidates and platform through outlicensing if you are interested in cavosontat and related intellectual property please contact us nivalis platform nivalis developed a broad portfolio of proprietary investigational small molecule inhibitors of the snitrosoglutathione reductase gsnor protein which have been shown in preclinical studies to increase cftr activity as well as decrease airway inflammation nivalis’ drug candidate portfolio consists of multiple compounds which are designed for oral intravenous iv or inhaled administration lead clinical candidate cavosonstat n is an investigational small molecule that has the potential to address a defect in cftr resulting from mutations in the cftr gene the underlying cause of cf nivalis believed cavosonstat is a firstinclass cftr stabilizer that modulates cftr activity through a novel mechanism of action potentially complementary to existing and future cftr modulators cavosonstat is the only clinical stage product candidate nivalis was aware of designed to stabilize cftr inside the cell and at the cell surface nivalis has preclinical data demonstrating the stabilizing effect of cavosonstat increases and prolongs cftr activity when added to other cftr modulators gsno and gsnor endogenous snitrosoglutathione gsno plays a critical role in modulating protein function through the transfer of nitric oxide to a protein thiol group or snitrosation although administering gsno directly has shown potential as a therapeutic intervention in preclinical models of cystic fibrosis and other diseases it is limited as a chronic therapy for several reasons including difficulty in formulation and administration depleted gsno levels are believed to contribute to loss of airway function and pathology in cf lung disease due to dysregulated snitrosation the snitrosation of certain proteins has been shown to modulate cftr activity and decrease inflammation in preclinical human airway and animal models of disease these targeted effects have been demonstrated to modify certain molecular chaperones such as hsphsp organizing protein or hop which affect trafficking and stability of the fdel cftr protein gsno concentrations are regulated by gsno reductase gsnor an enzyme that breaks down gsno gsnor through its regulation of gsno levels plays a key role in pulmonary gastrointestinal and cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology the nivalis drug development strategy was based on the premise inhibiting of gsnor should increase intracellular levels of gsno by preventing its degradation particularly in the setting of cystic fibrosis and other diseases with decreased levels of gsno andor increased gsnor
