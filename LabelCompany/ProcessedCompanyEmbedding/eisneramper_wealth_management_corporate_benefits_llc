top strategists recommendations are like monkeys throwing darts on december   barrons ran its annual outlook story featuring forecasts from a panel of  top wall street investment strategists the respected financial weekly publishes its panels predictions for the stock market for the year ahead and for the sectors they are buying and avoiding every december fritz meyer an independent economist whose research we pay for has tracked the wall street strategists sector forecasts in barrons every year since  mr meyer was an investment strategist at one of the worlds largest investment companies for over a decade before going independent in  with no products to sell except his research mr meyers data tracking the record of recommendations made by big retail brokerages firms represents a rare indepth look at the success of following wall streets investment advice so far in  through july  the  strategists from the large wall street firms have been prescient relative to their long record financials was the most favored sector with backing from eight strategists and health care was the next favored being picked by five strategists consumer staples was by far the least favored sector for  how have these picks and pans performed this year here are the results from the start of  through july  keep in mind however only half of the strategists picked the highlyperforming health care sector which was the second mostfavored of wall streets picks their clear favorite financials is underperforming the sp  energy one of their favored sectors is bombing utilities consumer staples and real estate which were all panned are all showing positive returns while wall streets top strategists recommendations are performing well so far in  their longterm record is not nearly as good year after year since  the socalled top strategists recommendations have performed poorly compared to a simple diversified portfolio according to meyer since the inception of barrons annual surveys of wall street strategists in  results on the strategists advice has been scattershot if wall streets strategists sector advice had been correct then the yellow dots would all lie along the red line instead theyre random wall street historically has been unable to predict how sectors will perform theyre throwing darts and their aim is off  was full of surprises like the election of donald j trump and the strategists did not perform well energy and telecom services were not the favored sectors of the strategists but those sectors outperformed all the others although the strategists favored financials and technology and both of those did well the materials and utilities sectors which they panned both beat the sp  with that in mind we want to remind you that the standard  poors  index closed on friday at  just a fraction off wednesdays closing price of  which set a new alltime high and a change in sentiment or unexpected negative news could trigger a  or  plunge at any time but the outlook for the fundamentals that drive stock prices remains bright and predicting the stock markets future is not what we do meyers analysis illustrates that the predictions of wall streets socalled top strategists are about as reliable at sector forecasting as monkeys throwing darts its why we invest based on a strategic evidencedbased discipline and are independent of the big wall street retail
