these two stocks beautify your portfolio leo sun tmfsunlion sep   at am beauty product companies generally arent known for explosive growth yet the industry is a fairly stable and noncyclical one which has grown at a pace of  to  annually over the past four years according to cosmetics giant loreal lets take a look at two of the best stocks in this sector  estee lauder nyseel and coty nysecoty estee lauderestee lauders portfolio includes wellknown brands like aveda donna karan mac bobbi brown clinique la mer and various licensed products for fashion houses source estee lauder in fiscal  estee lauders revenue declined  annually to  billion net earnings fell  to  billion and diluted earnings per share dropped  to  that doesnt sound great but those declines were mainly caused by foreign currency fluctuations since  of estee lauders revenue came from outside the americas excluding currency impacts sales actually rose  and diluted earnings remained flat stripping out the impact of accelerated orders and onetime charges sales and diluted earnings would have respectively risen  and  over the year  not bad for a mature personal products company the company also pays a forward annual dividend yield of  estee lauders business is split into four main categories makeup fragrances hair care products and skin care products in  sales from the first three categories rose annually on a constant currency basis but skin care sales slipped  skin care weakness has been an ongoing issue over the past few quarters especially with its smaller and midsized brands overtaking sales of its flagship estee lauder and clinique brands which have broader distribution channels slower department stores sales in the us and china which recently lowered its import taxes on skin care products also weighed down sales despite its skin care struggles estee lauder remains a best in breed stock in the beauty products industry and its growth should return once the dollar cools off the stock has risen about  over the past  months easily outperforming the sp s  decline however the stock isnt cheap at  times earnings which is significantly higher than the industry average of  for the personal products sector so investors should probably keep this one on their watchlists for now cotyinvestors looking for a more aggressive investment than estee lauder should check out coty which has rallied nearly  over the past  months coty produces fragrances color cosmetics and skin care products which are sold under licensed brands its top brands include calvin klein chloe davidoff marc jacobs adidas and playboy source coty in fiscal  cotys revenues declined  annually to  billion but remained flat on a likeforlike basis which only includes activities which were in effect during both periods excluding currency impacts revenue   of which came from outside the americas  rose  cotys adjusted net income rose  to  million during the year sales of cotys color cosmetics which accounted for a third of its top line rose  annually on a constant currency basis sales of fragrances and skinbody care products which accounted for the rest both declined by single digits coty plans to fill in those gaps by buying procter  gambles nysepg perfume hair care and cosmetic businesses in a massive  billion merger after that deal closes next year coty will overtake loreal as the biggest perfume maker in the world and become the third largest makeup company behind loreal and estee lauder it would gain the perfume licenses of gucci hugo boss and dolce  gabbana along with the cover girl and max factor makeup brands the new company would more than double its size and generate annual revenues exceeding  billion the merger would result in  million in savings but coty must assume pg beautys  billion in debt even as it evolves into a much larger company coty hasnt forgotten about boosting shareholder value it announced a new  million buyback plan in august and boosted its dividend by  to  per share in september which gives it a forward annual yield of  although coty seems to be evolving into the next loreal or estee lauder its much pricier than either company with a trailing pe of  therefore investors should keep a close eye on coty but be aware that its valuation could limit its upside potential the key takeawayestee lauder and coty are two solid ways to invest in beauty products both companies have noncyclical portfolios which hold up well during downturns as well as strong premium brands to ward off cheaper competitors however investors should be aware of the nearterm risks a strong dollar is bad for both companies and problems across europe and asia could curb spending on premium beauty products more importantly neither stock looks cheap compared to the market or other personal care stocks so we could see lower prices ahead leo sun has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends procter  gamble try any of our foolish newsletter services free for

have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
