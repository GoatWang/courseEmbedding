answers contact us login search search forget vanguard natural resources llc these  stocks are better buys the troubled upstream master limited partnership is teetering on the brink which is why investors need to look elsewhere matthew dilallo tmfmd dec   at pm image source getty images vanguard natural resources nasdaqvnr is in over its head right now as of the end of september the company had borrowed  billion under its bank credit facility that is a grave concern because its banks cut the borrowing base on that facility to  billion in october this decision means the company needs to repay the deficiency in six equal monthly payments or it may have no choice but to declare bankruptcy unfortunately that latter option is looking more likely with each passing day given its declining cash flow and other financial issues  because of the companys precarious financial situation investors should forget about investing in vanguard natural resources right now instead those looking for an oil and gas stock with a similar focus or business model should consider antero resources nysear parsley energy nysepe or enterprise products partners nyseepd instead heres why  natural gasdriven growth one thing that had drawn investors to vanguard natural resources in the past was its focus on natural gas over oil thanks to a string of acquisitions vanguard built a substantial natural gas asset base totaling  trillion cubic feet equivalent tcfe of proved reserves  about threequarters of which is gas  giving it tremendous optionality and upside to rising gas prices that said because of the companys higher costs and elevated debt level it cannot get the most out of this resource base contrast this with antero resources which is one of the fastestgrowing gas companies in the country the company currently controls the largest acreage position in the core of the marcellus shale as well as an expansive position in the utica these areas hold more than  tcfe of proved gas reserves and an estimated  tcfe of resource potential meanwhile thanks to its relatively low leverage and the highreturn nature of these wells antero resources believes it can grow production by  to  next year with significant growth potential in future years suffice it to say investors looking for gasdriven growth need to look past vanguard and consider antero resources instead making acquisitions the right way another draw of vanguards business model was its acquisitiondriven growth strategy since going public in  the company has spent  billion to complete  strategic acquisitions that said it funded the bulk of that growth with debt and worse yet used its credit facility as a primary funding source for dealmaking that decision now has the company near the brink of bankruptcy contrast this with parsley energy which primarily uses equity to fund acquisitions this year alone the company has completed four transactions which have added  net acres to its portfolio boosting its position by nearly  however each time it announced a deal the company immediately launched a stock offering because of that parsley energy has just  million of net debt which is a tiny amount for the more than  billion company furthermore parley energy has not touched its  million credit facility and currently has  million in cash which gives it ample liquidity for future deals or to drill more wells suffice it to say parsley energy knows the right way to do mergers and acquisitions in the oil patch image source getty images get your distributions here the third draw to vanguard in the past was its generous distributions at its peak the company was sending unitholders a lucrative cash payment every month however the significant slump in commodity prices when combined with the companys balance sheet issues forced it to cut the payout last year before stopping it altogether in  contrast this with enterprise products partners which has paid unitholders a distribution every quarter since going public in  having increased the payout  times including for the past  straight quarters driving the consistency of enterprise products partners distribution increases is its strong investment graderated balance sheet a conservative payout ratio and the fact that the bulk of its cash flow comes from stable feebased assets furthermore with several feebased expansion projects currently under construction enterprise products partners has clear visibility to keep its distribution growth streak alive meanwhile it will be a miracle for vanguard to get back into the position where it can start paying its investors distributions ever again investor takeaway investors might think vanguard natural resources low unit price is an attractive opportunity to pick up a natural gasfocused company potentially poised for a turnaround while it is possible that the company might fix its balance sheet woes before time runs out theres a real risk it could fail investors are better off avoiding that risk which is why they should forget about vanguard and consider investing in antero parsley or enterprise instead matt dilallo owns shares of enterprise products partners the motley fool recommends
