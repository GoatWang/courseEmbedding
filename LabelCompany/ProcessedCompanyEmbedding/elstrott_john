swimming upstream by kathy finn special to the advocate feb     am … photo provided by jackson hill  john elstrott of new orleans chairman of whole foods market board of directors though they lie at nearly opposite ends of the business growth spectrum international fresh foods retailer whole foods market inc a company with  billion in annual revenue that soon will open its sixth store in louisiana and fledgling local catering innovator dinner lab share a potentially crucial asset — the business savvy of one of new orleans’ foremost entrepreneursjohn elstrott not only chairs the board of directors of publicly traded whole foods market which operates some  stores in the united states canada and the united kingdom but is also integrally involved in a host of tiny businesses that aspire to become giants in their fieldwhile he is wellknown in local business circles and has been instrumental in turning a string of startups into industry leaders elstrott’s lowkey style has kept him largely behind the scenes and out of the eye of the business press even as new orleans’ reputation for nurturing entrepreneurial talent has soared “it’s very fulfilling for me to work with entrepreneurs to help them realize their dreams” he said recently in characteristically understated fashionfor several decades elstrott has put his entrepreneurial chops to work for growing businesses in louisiana and around the country he has cofounded and invested in grocery environmental and technology companies and has put his strategic skills behind locally owned construction and manufacturing businessesin the lingo of business creation elstrott is a serial entrepreneur but in fact he involved himself in all these business during a career that was anchored in academiaduring more than  years of teaching business at tulane university he founded the levyrosenblum institute for entrepreneurship and the tulane family business centerhis own education is in economics with bachelor’s and master’s degrees from lsu and a doctorate from the university of coloradohe has guided scores of young business students toward careers in business innovation sometimes becoming an investor and board member in their startupsthat’s how elstrott came to be involved in dinner lab a memberbased catering and events business that has quickly spread into  cities where teams of highly trained chefs and wait staffs serve hundreds of guests at popup dinner parties hosted in unusual settings dinner lab plans to enter the baton rouge market within the next few weeksfour of the company’s five founders were students of elstrott at tulane “we approached john early on and he joined our board and made the very first investment” cofounder and ceo brian bordainick saidlike many startups that survive their first few years dinner lab which launched in  evolved from its original concept as its founders responded to the marketplace“john was involved on the strategic side and his experience of working with whole foods in its early days was a big help” bordainick saidthe fact that elstrott had jumped into the health foods business in the ls “when everybody thought he must be nuts” meant a lot to the dinner lab founders bordainick said “when everyone was looking at us like we were crazy john was very supportive he was used to swimming upstream”elstrott’s first big push against the current came in the early s as the lsu graduate worked on his doctoral dissertation in economics at the university of colorado a couple of his friends had an idea to develop a brand of herbal teas that could tap into an incipient popular interest in organic food products they asked elstrott to helpfor  an hour elstrott tackled a host of backoffice tasks preparing loan applications developing an inventory system and securing an appropriate headquarters to replace the makeshift space the group had originally set up in a barna year or so later around the time of elstrott’s graduation celestial seasonings teas had begun to take off his friends invited him to buy into the business and become chief financial officer of the companythe newly married elstrott and his wife patty didn’t have to think twice he said “we invested most of our life savings — about  — in celestial seasonings”any veteran of startups can attest that luck plays a role in business success and firsttime investments seldom turn into winners but celestial seasonings bucked the trendelstrott remained with the company for five years until the couple who now had two young children decided to return to louisiana to be near their familiestoday celestial seasonings remains a major worldwide brand and hain celestial group inc has a market capitalization of  billion elstrott still owns stock in the companyelstrott said the value of his celestial seasonings experience grew exponentially over the years“i was fortunate to get involved in an area that was just taking off” he said of the stillgrowing trend toward healthy foods and ecologically responsible retailing“once you get that first success it’s like opening a door to a long corridor lots of opportunities are going to come your way” though he was teaching fulltime at tulane elstrott also headed fulltilt down an entrepreneurial path investing money and time as a board member or mentor in one enterprise after anotherhe first became involved with a new california tea maker called traditional medicinals a winner that remains in his portfolio today groundfloor investments that followed included such names as silk soy milk a company he helped to build and sell sambazon maker of “superfood” juice acai goodbelly probiotics and drug therapy developer microbiome therapeuticsone investment that kept elstrott consistently engaged was a grocery business with roots in new orleans and austin texasin  after local entrepreneur peter roy acquired the struggling whole foods coop store in new orleans he sought elstrott’s help to grow the business elstrott became roy’s first “outside” investor a short time later a similar grocery business in austin began to expand the local company became its first acquisition which is how elstrott became one of the first shareholders in whole foods markethe joined the company’s board in  and  years later was elected chairman over the decades he has seen whole foods market expand in three countries to employ  peoplewhile elstrott has long focused on the healthy food products sector he also ventured — as an investor board member or adviser — into the oilfield services hazardous waste cleanup telecommunications music and pharmaceutical industriesamong his current investments he is a board member of resource environmental solutions llc in baton rouge get healthy inc barriere construction co laitram corp zehnder communications inc and baton rougebased presonus audio electronics incthese days elstrott who retired from tulane in  considers himself a “professional board member” but others say his contributions go well beyond individual board roomstim williamson who  years ago founded nonprofit business accelerator idea village said elstrott “was in the vanguard” of the city’s efforts to become a hub for job creation and business innovationmeanwhile elstrott shows no sign of slowing down “i’m having too much fun” he saidthis year he expects whole foods market will hit  billion in revenue as it elbows its way through a growing crop of competitors and expands its geographic horizons “mexico may be next” he hintedand at the other end of the spectrum dinner lab which tripled its revenue in the past year aims to become a leader in culinary events in every large city in americaultimately elstrott predicted dinner lab will be known for putting on splashy parties with great food

crabs but in february  made an exception for a portland maine store for its ability to meet humane standards the lobsters are kept in private compartments instead of being piled on top of one another in a tank and employees use a device that gives them a volt shock so that they are not boiled alive in a pot of water this decision was criticized by exlobsterman trevor corson as damaging a new england tradition and as removing peoples connection to where their food actually comes from ronnie cummins national director of the united states organic consumers association said that whole foods market simply uses the term natural as a marketing tool cummins concluded that whole foods market now is a bigbox retailer – and its much more concerned about competing with the other big boxes than
