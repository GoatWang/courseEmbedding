company application suite competitive advantage blog blog press releases news the facts our team facebook updates the news feed what it means for users marketers startups small businesses and the future on march th facebook announced the biggest change to its popular news feed feature since its launch in  in the big announcement mark zuckerberg compared facebook to a newspaper “our mission is to give everyone in the world the best personalized newspaper in the world” zuckerberg said in response to recent claims that facebook has lost touch with its users the updated news feed is an attempt to bring back control and personalization to its enormous user base as is the case with all updates to facebook many users will complain and brands will speculate about what it means for their business but by bringing multiple feeds bigger visuals a cleaner interface and consistent design there’s surely a lot to love about facebook’s latest update how does this update impact the user experience there’s no doubt that social media has taken an imageheavy turn in the past year with the obvious success of imagefocused networks like pinterest tumblr and instagram facebook’s photo offerings were beginning to look outdated with that in mind the biggest change users will notice in this news feed update is increased space for bigger richer images to be shared images will now fill  pixels across the news feed instead of  pixels giving users more opportunity to showcase their photo albums and personal moments   additionally the added image space in the news feed rollsover to content shared from sources outside of facebook for example content shared to facebook from pinterest quora and instagram will get a visual boost too making the facebook experience more visually attractive no matter what content is being shared furthermore users will experience refined control of the feeds they wish to see on their home page techcrunch explains that the new feeds will be sorted by how frequently you check them for easy access they include  all friends – a feed that shows you everything your friends are sharing  photos – a feed with only photos from your friends and pages you like including instagram  music – a feed with posts about the music you and your friends have played  following – a feed with the latest news from the pages you like and the people you follow  games – a feed dedicated to games being played by your friends essentially other than in the “default” news feed view facebook will not decide what shows up on your home screen as it has done in the past with the potential for more finetuned control users should feel more connected to what they’re seeing on facebook and why they’re seeing it this should greatly improve the user experience putting the power back in the hands of the people sharing content josh constantine of techcrunch sums the benefits of multiple feeds nicely “overall users simply have more choice now if they want to see content from businesses it’s easier to do so now than it was before if they don’t they can skip them” how will users marketers startups and small businesses be impacted by the redesigned news feed most notably images will play an even larger role for facebook marketers after the news feed update as mentioned above facebook is going to provide a lot more room to display images in all their glory but because users will now have the ability to control what news streams they pay attention to brands on facebook are going to have to do an even better job at providing high quality relevant visual content if they want to stand out ryan tate of wired emphasized the importance of quality visual content for businesses after attending the launch event on thursday “a redesign like the one unveiled on thursday could potentially boost the attention directed at posts from news publishers and businesses showing large images and videos as the new design does gives extra importance to professionally shot photos and videos like those regularly commissioned by news organizations and advertisers” as seen in the screenshot below sponsored stories and suggested posts ads will be displayed significantly larger than before in the new news feed if you think of the new news feed like a newspaper the importance of welldesigned ads becomes clearer no one reads the new york times expecting to see half thought out advertisements or offtopic messaging readers expect quality content from now on advertisers and businesses will need to take advantage of visual content if they want to succeed on the news feed but that doesn’t mean they should forget about all the other facebook marketing best practices that still stand if anything business owners and marketers on facebook should be more thoughtful about what they publish now having the option to view a “friends only” feed users will easily be able to completely ignore your brand’s posts page owners should carefully rethink their content strategies and ensure that they are posting relevant photos updates and links to their target audience brands that don’t run the risk of becoming pushed aside or worse “unliked” by users need

toolkit news social marketing  the future processes of internet search when it comes to looking for information online the future of search has some definite trends for  in part this new change is working in tandem with the ever growing and changing technology market as we’ve seen with the invention of smartphones and tablets web users are becoming more and more reliant on the convenience of the mobile web search nonetheless of the new improvements and upcoming search trends one of the most highly anticipated changes is the move toward more humanized search processes that are based on natural trends and habits conveyed by individual activity between users on social media sites with respect to the new surge in mobile searching in the past it was merely an alternative to the search norm which had always been from a pc device or laptop in today’s market mobile searching is up and coming as an industry standard and with that said mobile searching has become a necessary staple from which millions of users are drawing from on a daily basis the difference in this trend from recent practices is that in former times only sites generating the most online traffic really utilized specialized mobile applications and formats as a result the new norm will require that particular web sites that have not yet made the mobile leap will have to be formatted to support these types of applications by updating their sites to include mobile friendly searches for tablets smartphones and other devices… companies working to stay relevant in a mobile trending and possibly dominated market in the near future will have a competitive edge another new trend associated with methods of seo searching has to do with the relationships of titles tags and headings individually each of these items has always been integral to the process of an online database search of information however now the system is playing more heavily off of the relationship of title to tag and content as opposed to keyword searching only to put it more clearly instead of focusing on one word that would link a search to a specific idea or topic – heavy hitting companies setting precedents in the search game are planning to focus on a more narrow search for example one that would be based on the establishment of how strong the correlation is between a heading and content within a written blog piece this can be done by breaking up paragraphs and making them more relative to each heading thereby making the correlation denser despite the future changes in content writing and the way internet users search… there are staples that will remain consistent for the fact that the very nature of the seo game has simply to do with the facts and dressing them up… staying competitive will continue to mean providing people with useful information in the shape of direct facts that provide a creative spin while elaborating on the fine nuances of any given topic at the same time finally the idea of seo in comparison to conversion optimization has been of debate lately in the it market in  businesses are trending toward a new tool of measurement when considering the value of a site the new shift seems to be embracing the idea of website strength in terms of its ability to actually convert an online visitor – to interactive user as opposed to merely considering traffic volume which can simply translate to browsing overall the future of search is delving into a new age all together when it comes to search relevance personalized searches or how to go about judging brand strength instead of relying on merely computer data statistics or algorithms…  has ushered in a new wave of idealism and order – weaving these elements together for a more effective way to gauge website success march   –

’net yesterday with the launch of a new tool called graph search the tool essentially allows people to discover information based on data that facebook has collected from its users over time for example someone could use graph search to discover information such as “restaurants in chicago that my friends like” or “photos of me that i liked” while graph search is currently in a limited beta release the tool seems to improve the social network’s lackluster search bar which previously only allowed users to search for people or pages on the social network moreover graph search has the potential to impact businesses on facebook discover five things you should know about graph search below  likes matter facebook likes are now more important than ever especially for businesses according to a facebook blog post graph search can make it easier for people to discover and learn more about businesses on facebook this is because the search results are based on facebook’s robust database which includes information that has been shared by businesses and individuals alike that being said businesses with a large fan base will be more likely to turn up in searches for phrases like “restaurants in chicago that my friends like”  engagement is key aside from obtaining likes businesses should focus on maintaining an engaging page that includes quality interactions with fans since the search results are based on information that has been shared by businesses and individuals interactions between a business and their fans can help the business score higher in the search results furthermore graph search also makes interactions like checkins even more important because users could potentially search for phrases like “places in los angeles that my friends have been to”  invest in your page facebook’s blog post states that the best thing businesses can do for their page is to continue to invest in it and make sure that it is complete and uptodate items like the name category vanity url and information within the “about” section of a business page can help make it easier for people to find the business on facebook additionally page owners should make sure that their business’s address is correct because this information could help someone discover a local business when they are searching for places in a specific location  there are no graph search ad formats…yet as graph search becomes more widely available so will the speculation of a new ad format from facebook however the social network confirmed in their blog post that there are currently no new ad formats available for graph search however it is important to note that pages and apps can still use the sponsored results ad format to show up in the search results for all facebook users whether they have graph search or not  sign up to try it graph search is currently in a limited beta release which means that you must sign up for a waitlist to gain access to this tool according to facebook the rollout of graph search will be gradual starting with a very small number of users this means that the company is still working out some of the bugs in order to provide the best search results possible to its users before the tool is available to everyone original post by allison howen   january   –  pm categories facebook graph search  post a comment tagged facebook graph search

facebook news feed in a move that seems to be aimed at remedying this fact facebook will be introducing a dedicated “page notification” news feed option as a facebook marketer it can be frustrating to realize that only a small percentage of your fans are actually seeing the updates you post on a page with less than  fans it can be depressing to see that only  or so saw your exciting update many managers have claimed that the facebook edgerank has made it difficult to reach fans that could potentially be interested in content and now facebook seems to have come up with a solution jon loomer has reported that the option to subscribe to a page news feed by getting notifications has been introduced to facebook inside facebook shows screenshots of an option to “get notifications” from a particular facebook page by digging into the “like” options a bit then presumably every time a facebook page you’ve selected creates a status update you should be notified on top of facebook similar to the way you are whenever a person comments or likes something of yours facebook has confirmed that they are indeed introducing the feature “we are currently rolling out the ability for people to receive notifications from specific pages friends or public figures that they are connected to this feature will help people keep up with the people and things that they care about most” what does this mean for page managers whenever you see this option roll out be sure to let your fans know let them know that they can “subscribe” to make sure they don’t miss any updates will people actually use this new feature  maybe or maybe it will just make things more difficult for pages jon loomer expresses uncertainty about the new feature “many brands should feel uneasy about these potential changes if you are putting your visibility in the hands of the users you can no longer blame edgerank if no one sees your content if your fans don’t take action to see your stuff more often it’s pretty clear how they feel about you” what do you think will you take advantage of this new feature or do you think it could pose a problem november   –  am categories facebook marketing  comments  tagged edgerank engagement page management  control which fans see facebook page status updates with its latest update facebook enables page managers to control which fans see facebook updates from a page in their news feed announced on facebook’s help docs page managers now have a new marketing tool in their facebook arsenal the latest addition lets page owners choose which fans see a page’s status updates limiting your audience may sound silly but in some cases can be used to strategically push out messages to different types of fans  now page managers can choose specific demographic aspects of their audience to target posts before posting make sure to click the dropdown menu that says “public” and change it to a narrower physical audience if you’d like the new feature lets you also decide if you want to control which fans see your facebook post the options for targeting that pop up from this “target” icon include gender relationship status education interested in age location language filters such as “gender” can be selected from there unless you change them “male” will be selected by default multiple filters can be selected for post targeting making sure your post only reaches a very specific audience in the news feed why is this useful some facebook pages have very diverse audiences and may find it useful to target different segments of fans with specifics posts in the case that a certain portion of your fan base will find information relevant this could be a useful option remember whatever post you make even if it is targeted to certain users in the news feed will show up on your facebook page’s timeline so don’t post anything you wouldn’t want a certain portion of your fans to see in other words don’t discriminate between fans by using targeted posts as they could potentially come across the messages on your facebook page october   –  pm categories facebook pages  post a comment tagged facebook on posts who your  facebook for nonprofits making the most of your time for nonprofits everything counts the world of social media marketing has made the barriers to promote a cause and request donation almost nonexistent using facebook wisely nonprofits can build an audience and increase brand awareness is your nonprofit using facebook to promote its cause if not it should be facebook has just surpassed  billion active users everyone and their mom is on facebook and nearly every major corporation and small business has a presence on the site nonprofits need an affordable solution to facebook marketing while facebook may be free to begin with once your nonprofit has signed up created a facebook page and begun trying to build an audience you might quickly realize that facebook marketing might require some time and money – more than you expected for that reason fanpage toolkit has explicitly made its suite of marketing applications available to nonprofits hoping to build a presence on facebook the fanpage toolkit nonprofit page builder for facebook for small nonprofits on a budget there is almost no need to invest in a potentially expensive website when effective facebook use can offer equal benefits and provide similar results now nonprofits can collect donations directly on facebook eagle’s wings albania has done a great job of implementing the fanpage toolkit nonprofit donation app this app is perfect for nonprofits looking to collect donations from their fan base instead of making an entirely separate website the nonprofit page builder app provides the full functionality of a donation website easily compatible with paypal and credit cards better yet the app provides  distinct visual templates for nonprofits to choose from when building a page as seen above each template leaves room to express the mission of your nonprofit whether it’s through rich images text or even video at the bottom of each nonprofit facebook page template is a “donate” button that links directly to any existing paypal account your nonprofit has in place what nonprofit wouldn’t want a donate button directly on facebook easily collect donations from your fans directly on your facebook page no

facebook has added a much needed notification to its arsenal of marketing tools have you seen new notifications like this one   facebook is always trying to make advertising more appealing to marketers in the past creating a facebook ad was something that seemed limited to only the biggest brands with the biggest budgets and dedicated marketing teams next facebook started emphasizing the power of advertising for small business finally facebook introduced promoted posts making advertising all too tempting and easy to do with the click of a button marketers were able to place an order for a promoted post since then promoted posts have become a standard way for businesses to gain more exposure among their fans and we love using them even adding as little as  to a post can increase its reach by thousands of people when used correctly promoted posts can become a valuable part of any pages marketing strategy except even with promoted posts there is a “lag” period where the post ad must be approved by facebook with this latest update facebook has brought ad notifications to the forefront of its platform informing page managers whenever their latest ads have been approved this is good news anything to make the process of buying paying and tracking facebook ads less painful is a step in the right direction in our opinion because the delay between ordering a facebook ad and it actually being put into rotation can be so long this feature now serves as a great reminder function to go back into the ads manager and check on your newly created facebook ads building facebook ads has been streamlined making it easier for page managers to keep track of the ads they have running will only make it more tempting to create more ads with this latest update facebook does just that making ad approval as important as a new “like” notification have you seen this new notification appear on your timeline yet is it helpful october   –  am categories facebook promotions  post a comment tagged facebook facebook ad targeting facebook ads manager like notifications  is a facebook page more valuable than a website in recent survey  of respondents explained that they value a brand’s facebook page more than its website are you taking note mashable is reporting that after surveying  social media users lab found that half of them actually found more value in a brand’s facebook page more than its stand alone website  of users liked a page to receive a free item so what do the results tell us based on the fact that half of users find a facebook page more valuable than a brand’s website we know that brands that aren’t already using facebook as a business channel are missing out for the fair price of  a small business or brand can jump on facebook and begin building an audience can a fully functional and branded website be made for that amount probably not even when factoring in the purchase of facebook advertising or targeted promoted posts to increase reach and engagement the budget to setup and promote a brand on facebook is significantly less than that of a standalone website  but why do users actually like brand pages not surprisingly  of those surveyed said they liked a brand page because they wanted a free item do you know what that tells us you need to be using promotions to give away free items facebook insists that you use a rd party app when creating a promotion or gathering information from fans and luckily many of these promotional apps can be installed for free as a brand with promotional tools you can provide great value for your fans without having to spend more than you’re comfortable with with the low cost of running a facebook page in mind surely your brand can spare some budget to create worthwhile promotions or giveaways right users want to achieve something valuable by liking a page if you don’t provide that be it a prize product or promotion then why should they stay around then what makes a person unlike a page we can clearly see that users like pages on facebook in hopes of winning something getting a coupon or saving money but why do users unlike a page the survey found that  of users typically unliked a facebook page because “it cluttered their news feed” there’s an easy take away  represented by that figure – don’t post too often brands that crowd their fans’ home screen may quickly see themselves unliked keep posts consistent and timely don’t feel forced to post every little bit of news that comes out don’t post too often or you’ll clutter fans’ news feeds in some cases a brand may not remain relevant to a user’s interests which is why it’s increasingly important to remain focused and post on topic for your fans if a brand strays from its core audience’s interests by posting funny cat pictures or the latest viral video how is that forwarding the business just because you’re using facebook doesn’t mean you should “sabotage” your brand by giving in to the latest trends spreading across the news feed in fact we’ve argued against posting the same thing as everyone else as it limits your exposure most people believe facebook is a good place to interact with brands these numbers make it clear to see if you’re not using facebook as a secondary or primary site to drive business and fan interaction you’re missing out with  of users surveyed saying they think facebook is a good place to interact with brands there’s no reason you shouldn’t be engaging them   september   –  pm categories facebook pages  post a comment tagged brand loyalty engagement facebook marketing page management website  facebook commerce and small retailers get cozy facebook offers something to small retailers that large chains and corporations can’t compete with – a personal connection to an audience is your small business taking advantage of it usa today is reporting that facebook has become the goto place for small businesses and retailers to set up shop are we surprised no way it has become increasingly clear that facebook provides a platform from which small businesses and retailers can set up shop build a small and personal audience and promote a few unique products or services a personal touch is necessary for interaction on facebook while a giant retailer might have hired someone to manage their facebook page does that manager truly know its audience does that manager even know who the page’s fans are probably not in fact the article says “socialcommerce gurus say small retailers have the edge over big names because they behave more like friends on facebook” paul chaney author of the fcommerce handbook explains “this is where small business can really hit it out of the park…i connect with the guy or lady who runs the business and that’s the person who’s posting” when it comes down to it small businesses might just know their customers better than the big guys in many cases small business owners are on the ground in their store selling and working hard all day the best part though is that facebook has opened up another sales channel to small business owners and now they can easily connect with customers through a business page small businesses are succeeding every day with fanpage toolkit’s app suite fanpage toolkit has made it easy for small businesses to jump on board the prime real estate of facebook and start selling but selling would be meaningless if there wasn’t the ability to support sales with promotional tools and marketing content small business owners need to make their time on facebook worth while creating a page is the first step but that alone won’t guarantee fans or sales pages must be supported with promotions and giveaways luckily our platform is full of apps designed to support the small business owner looking for “more bang for their buck” no one wants to spend extra money to build a facebook presence right especially for small businesses product value is of utmost importance facebook commerce is one of the many apps in our suite one reason we saw so many bigname retailers pulling out of facebook commerce in recent months is pricing these big retailers were paying it costs
