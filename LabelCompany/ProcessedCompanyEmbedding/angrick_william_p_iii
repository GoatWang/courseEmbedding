haroon    alumni profile william p angrick iii  asad haroon  and jaime mateustique  supply chain gains inventory thats water under the bridge for others brings a torrent of success to kellogg alumni at liquidity services inc by kari richardson class of  graduates william p angrick iii and jaime mateustique credit the kellogg school for a solid grounding in entrepreneurship while earning their mba degrees they worked through handson classes in new venture formulation and marketing new products organized entrepreneurship conferences — a technology entrepreneurship conference angrick helped found continues to this day — and participated in clubs organized around their shared interest their management education also set the stage for a more elusive but important part of their present entrepreneurial success a strong friendship and partnership finding the right partner is one of the most important aspects of succeeding in business mateustique says you simply cannot make it without that today their yearold company liquidity services inc is a great success according to its web site the washington dcbased firm which specializes in helping businesses and government agencies dispose of obsolete and discontinued inventory had revenues of  million for fiscal year  it now employs some  people and encompasses  million square feet of warehouse space becoming the fourthfastest growing firm in america according to entrepreneur magazine the firm is getting noticed the ernst  young entrepreneur of the year award was recently granted to liquiditys founders including benjamin brown asad haroon  the companys cmo has also been a key contributor upon graduation from kellogg angrick who is chairman and ceo and mateustique who is president and coo followed their professors advice to gain experience and build skills by joining a company before venturing out on their own angrick began his career as an investment banker working with highgrowth ecommerce and mateustique signed on as an associate with a large consulting firm tackling supply chain and media issues after years working on their own angrick and mateustique found a way to combine their new media savvy and knowledge of business services in an entrepreneurial venture the idea was to help businesses and government agencies manage the reverse supply chain — remarketing of retail customer returns overstock products and unwanted inventory that can consume warehouse space and drain energy from moving finished goods through the firms forward supply chain with its online marketplaces which include liquidationcom govliquidationcom and uksurpluscom the firm uses the internet to match buyers and sellers in businesstobusiness transactions in much the same way ebay does with smallerscale sales but instead of bidding on one rare record or a used childrens toy the companys professional buyers typically compete for bulk quantities of items such as power tools digital camcorders printers or any product sold by a big box retailer angrick says the average sale on the sites totals about  and the typical quantity ranges from one pallet of goods to a truckload before and after online sale liquidity services helps buyers and sellers manage their transactions by offering assistance with inbound shipping and storage inventory inspection and organization development of a sales or marketing plan payment collection and outbound transportation before turning to liquidity services many of our customers handled this process with paper and pencil and fax and spreadsheet angrick says we believe this new model is a best practice for corporations to manage products in the reverse supply chain the firms online marketplaces attract buyers from  countries who typically resell refurbish or export their purchases — or turn around and sell them on ebay angrick estimates that about onequarter of buyers are themselves the largevolume ebay entrepreneurs known as power sellers all merchandise is sold on an asis basis with liquidity services receiving a fee based on the gross merchandise sales value sellers remain confidential liquidity services even offers to remove trademarks if a company wishes the bottom line according to angrick and mateustique is that liquidity services approach to selling unwanted inventory creates competition that benefits business and government alike  kellogg school of

to go public theyve supposedly been functioning fine without the hundreds of millions of dollars their seeking in my opinion their biggest problems are yet to come for if they already have hundreds of

arbitrate remove reports no better yet arbitrate to set the record straight rebuttals  replies author consumer employeeowner updates  rebuttals  consumer comment satisified with liquidity services author merle  usa submitted tuesday may   posted tuesday may   i am resonding to albert in columbus georgia albert i am a satisfied customer and investor in liquidity services apparently the department of defense is satisfied as well i have yet to see any information backing your baseless claim that liquidity is going to lose that contract many large publications also preach the successes of liquidity maybe you should pick up an entreprenour magazine once in a while most online stock rating organizations also label liquidity as a strong buy you made the claim  months ago that the sec is opening a manilla folder on liquidity i have seen no evidence of this either after reading your comments it makes me wonder which category you fall in to  an investor who bailed when the stock fell and youre now angry because you dont know how to read the market or  a customer who was outbid for a product or a customer who successfully bought something from liquidity many items are sold as is and are not functional perhaps you failed to read that part of the contract a third possibility is that you are just a jealous nobody who is angry that someone else through hard work and education saw a business possibility and made it into a success regardless of which type of moron you are i fail to see how advocating someones murder is appropriate i cant believe that the editors of this report allowed your idiotic rant to be posted i hope mr angrick and his attornies are taking appropriate action and will be adding to his fortune due to your stupidity respond to this report whats this are
