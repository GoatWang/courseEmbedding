that seek to reverse the thrust of the lawsuit by claiming that it was the plaintiff  not the defendant  who committed legal wrongs and that as a result it is the defendant who is entitled to money damages or other relief usually filed as part of the defendants answer  which also denies plaintiffs claims  a counterclaim is commonly but not always based on the same events that form the basis of the plaintiffs complaint for example a defendant in an auto accident lawsuit might file a counterclaim alleging that it was really the plaintiff who caused the accident in some states the counterclaim has been replaced by a similar legal pleading called a crosscomplaint in other states and in federal court where counterclaims are still used a defendant must file any counterclaim that stems from the same events covered by the plaintiffs complaint or forever lose the right to do so in still other states where counterclaims are used they are not mandatory meaning a defendant is free to raise a claim that it was really the plaintiff who was at fault either in a counterclaim or later as part of a separate lawsuit real estate agenta foot soldier of the real estate business who shows houses and
