and wales annington was created in  to acquire more than  residential properties from the ministry of defence the ‘mod’ the majority of which were immediately leased back to the mod on a year lease annington refurbishes and sells or rents on the open market those homes released by the mod as surplus to its needs the business now owns approximately  homes the majority of which are still leased to the mod   investment strategy assetbacked annington acquired  residential properties – making it one of the largest private owners of residential property in england and wales currently annington owns almost  homes with most still leased to the mod requiring fundamental change a new business was created to manage the properties annington leased to the mod and to refurbish and sell or rent on the open market those homes released by the mod as surplus   creating value transforming strategy the strategy for the newly created business was to develop a flexible and costeffective refurbishment and sales capability to maximise the potential from sites released by the mod and to explore specific opportunities related to either the existing portfolio or further mod housing requirements annington created a flexible sales organisation to deal with fluctuating numbers of properties released in unpredictable geographic locations through sensitive pricing strategies and the careful use of incentives home ownership has been made a realistic option for those who have previously been priced out of the uk’s property market annington has sold nearly  homes to the public with the majority sold to firsttime buyers and many to service or exservice personnel since  annington has built or achieved planning permission for more than  new homes of which more than  have been affordable homes strengthening management the properties were acquired with no management a team was appointed to establish an effective governance and operating structure annington’s operating model is based on a small core team that uses outsourcing as a major tool to meet the fluctuating requirements of the business developing through capital expenditure capital expenditure has been deployed on property and site improvements to maximise the value from house sales with the types of properties that annington owns the location and environment are very important and it dedicates substantial investment to creating an attractive environment and ‘street scene’ around the properties building through mergers and acquisitions annington has added value through planning redevelopment and infill development it has also used available cash to acquire additional properties to lease to either the mod or private tenants annington continues to work with the mod to find creative solutions to its housing challenges and to look for opportunities to leverage its established management platform lowering the cost of capital to create extra upside the stable governmentbacked rental cash flow from the leased estate along with proceeds from the sale of properties released and annington’s impressive track record have enabled the business to maintain an appropriate level of leverage status of
