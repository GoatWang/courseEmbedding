diversity we are committed to fairness and in particular the promotion of equality of opportunity for all taking equality considerations into account in our work is an important and integral part of our approach as both an employer and a policymaker equality in policymaking when working on policy our officials look at the impact a policy option might have on those from protected groups including positive opportunities for promoting greater fairness for them they also consider if there are options for avoiding or otherwise mitigating against any negative impact on that group ministers are advised of the impact a decision has on protected groups and this is taken into account when a policy decision is made although the treasury sets departmental budgets it is up to each individual department to decide how they spend that budget in deciding how the budget is to be spent departments must consider the impact on protected groups there are some policy areas such as welfare where the treasury has a greater policy making responsibility case study spending round  and autumn statement  we considered the impact policy measures have on protected groups throughout the policy development and decision making process both in the spending round of  and in the autumn statement of  advice to ministers on individual measures for these fiscal events included a summary of impacts including the impact on protected groups equalities analysis was included in advice submitted to the chancellor before he made final decisions building on our work on equalities during spending review  the spending round  process also involved working with other government departments to assess the equality impacts of their work in addition the chief secretary to the treasury hosted an external ‘equalities experts round table’ early in the spending round process in order to inform the government’s thinking an equalities annex was published alongside the main document tax information and impact notes tiins were produced for tax measures announced in the autumn statement of  tiins provide information on the policy objective the impact on the exchequer the economy and individuals businesses and civil society organisations as well as the impact on protected groups all tiins published in the autumn were personally signed off by the financial secretary confirming that it was a reasonable view of the impact of the measures given the available evidence in december  hmrc published a document that brought together the tiins of tax measures for which draft legislation was published equality as an employer we promote equality of opportunity in employment to ensure our workforce is representative of the community it serves and that we attract and retain talented employees we publish regular information on the diversity of our work force information on the diversity of the treasury’s employees is also published in the treasury’s annual report and accounts

traces its origins to the treasury of the kingdom of england which had come into existence by  in the reign of henry i the treasury emerged from the royal household it was where the king kept his treasures the head of the treasury was called the lord treasurer starting in tudor times the lord treasurer became one of the chief officers of state and competed with the lord chancellor for the

ashley sir w coventry sir j duncomb and sir t clifford after  the treasury was always in commission the commissioners were referred to as the lords of the treasury and were given a number based on their seniority eventually the first lord of the treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government and from robert walpole on the holder of the office began to be known unofficially as the prime minister until  the first lord of the treasury when a commoner also held the office of chancellor of the exchequer while if the first lord was a peer the second lord usually served as chancellor

content search site menu search t     you are herehomeinsightspublications and briefingshm treasury and the fca consult on the implementation of the insurance distribution directive publication hm treasury and the fca consult on the implementation of the insurance distribution directive  jul  the insurance distribution directive idd will repeal the insurance mediation directive imd and must be transposed by  february  with less than a year to go until the implementation deadline the government and the fca have issued consultation papers on the transposition of the idd into uk domestic law in this article juanita morrison and emma radmore look at the proposed changes to uk law and regulation treasury consultation how will the idd be implemented in the uk the imd came into force on  january  and was transposed into uk law by virtue of the fsas as it then was rules and amendments to the financial services and markets act  fsma and the fsma regulated activities order  rao the government envisages that the transposition of the idd will take effect in a similar way the idd applies to persons who conduct insurance distribution activities including reinsurers who sell directly to customers reinsurance intermediaries and ancillary intermediaries this means the idd will cover the sale of insurance products directly by an insurer whereas the imd applied only to intermediaries in the uk the government does not anticipate that this will have a significant impact as it chose to apply the imd to insurers as well as insurance intermediaries so uk law has been superequivalent to the imd in this respect additionally the idd includes in its definition of insurance distribution the activities of insurance companies and price comparison websites but these activities are already subject to regulation in the uk as with the imd the idd is a minimum harmonising directive this means the directive sets the minimum standards required and member states are then free to add further requirements for their respective territory in the consultation papers the government and fca seek views on the minimum standards and the additional requirements proposed to implement the idd what about brexit hm treasurys consultation paper remarks that during the period of brexit negotiations and while the uk remains a full member of the eu the government will continue to apply eu legislation the government intends to transpose and implement the idd to schedule and by  february  scope the connected contracts exclusion for products sold as part of a package or addons by firms whose main business is other than the distribution of insurance products article b of the rao currently provides an exclusion known as the connected contracts exclusion where a provider that is a person who supplies nonmotor goods or travelrelated services in the course of a business which does not otherwise consist of regulated activities carries out insurance mediation activities in relation to a contract which is complementary to the providers service and meets all of a number of set criteria then the provider does not require authorisation under fsma to carry out these activities common examples are retailers who sell insurance cover on white goods that they supply because of the limitations of the exclusion in particular that it does not apply if the contract covers liability risks it is safe to rely on it only in narrow circumstances the governments preference is to exclude life insurance and liability risk products from the connected contracts exclusion as it did when the imd was implemented the basis for the continued regulation of such products is that the government considers these products to be complex and could lead to significant consumer detriment if missold scope widening of the introducer exemption one way in which the idd provides greater flexibility for firms is in respect of providing information the mere provision of data and information on potential policyholders to insurers and insurance intermediaries and viceversa is removed from the idds definition of regulated insurance distribution activities provided the firm does not take further steps to assist in the conclusion of the contract the government does not consider that the deregulation of such firms whose activities are limited in this way would cause detriment to consumers however the government is not inclined to legislate for a broader exemption for introducers it believes that some firms acting as introducers do more than providing information and broadening the exemption could result in more firms becoming involved in the conclusion of the contract without regulation so its proposal is to exclude from the scope of regulation only this limited information provision but to maintain all wider introducer activities within scope passporting when an eea firm operates in the uk on a freedom of services basis it is the responsibility of the eea firms home state regulator to ensure the firm is compliant with the idd alternatively if an eea firm operates on a freedom of establishment basis the idd permits the responsibility for compliance to be split between the home state regulator and the pra or the fca as appropriate in both instances the idd permits the host state to intervene and the government proposes amendments to fsma to enable the pra or more likely fca as the appropriate host state regulator to intervene in the event of a breach in specified circumstances fca can act as home state regulator article  of the idd permits the appropriate uk regulator to enter into an agreement with that firms home state regulator to act as if it were the home state regulator where the insurance distributors primary place of business is in the uk the government is seeking to effect this by way of amendments to fsma and for the appropriate regulator to publish any article  agreement it enters into however given the novelty of the provision it is unclear how often it will be used fca consultation what are the fcas proposals the fca has published two consultations on idd implementation the fcas first consultation covered the application of idd including the change in terminology from insurance mediation to insurance distribution in the fca handbook the professional and organisational requirements complaints handling and outofcourt redress changes to the insurance conduct of business icobs rules and the regulatory regime for an ancillary insurance intermediary aii where minimum requirements of idd go beyond the fcas current rules the fca will include such requirements in its new rules however the fca is not proposing to change the existing uk provisions which go beyond the idds minimum requirements ancillary insurance intermediaries aiis the idd introduces aiis as a new category of firm to satisfy the definition of an aii a firm must meet the following conditions its principal professional activity is other than insurance distribution it only distributes insurance products that are complementary to another good or service it does not offer life assurance or liability risks unless the cover compliments the good or service that the intermediary provides as its primary professional activity the idd does not require the direct regulation of aiis whose insurance distribution activities are limited to products which meet particular criteria the uk’s connected contracts exclusion is narrower than the idd as it includes motor warranties and connected travel within regulation as discussed above the treasury has consulted on whether any changes are required to the connected contracts exclusion in light of the idd the fca is proposing to create three categories of aii inscope aiis these are firms who are within idd scope and other firms who are within the uk regulatory perimeter but may be outside the idd connected travel insurance cti providers these are firms whose primary business is to make travel arrangements for customers but who distribute insurance that is complementary to those services outofscope aiis these are firms such as white goods and furniture retailers who fall outside the uk regulatory perimeter because of the connected contracts exclusion as currently drafted where insurers and intermediaries use outofscope aiis for aiis who are outside of the uks regulatory perimeter the fca proposes to place an obligation on the authorised firm under icobs to ensure that customers are provided with information on its identity address and complaints procedure so inscope aiis and cti providers will in principle be subject to all fca requirements except that the cti providers need not comply with the conflicts and transparency disclosures whereas outofscope aiis need only comply with the overarching principles precontract disclosure and complaints and redress requirements staff knowledge and competence requirements fcas proposal for insurers and intermediaries staff knowledge and competence requirements includes the following minimum  hours of continuing professional development for those directly involved in insurance distribution including product or sales managers but not employees in roles such as hr facilities management or it the fca proposes to issue guidance on the format and content of cpd it notes firms subject to its tc sourcebook will already be subject to higher cpd requirements it will not require employees to hold any particular qualification unless tc already requires them to do so firms must maintain records of employee competence under the idd the minimumrecord keeping requirements only apply to insurance and reinsurance undertakings but the fca proposes to extend the requirement to include intermediaries and aiis the fca does not anticipate that this will result in significant additional costs and expects it will result in consumer protection benefits the requirements will apply to insurers and reinsurers as well as to intermediaries so the fca will go beyond the idd in this respect as it does for firms subject to tc however the knowledge and competence requirements will apply only to those employees involved in insurance distribution and can be modulated to apply in a proportionate manner to for example call centre operatives pii cover the fca currently requires intermediaries to hold higher minimum aggregate pii cover than the idd minimum and also sets conditions on excess levels and specific terms within the cover it proposes to amend all requirements to require the idd minimum but to keep its existing superequivalent requirements use of intermediaries the idd requires reinsurers and intermediaries to use only authorised or exempt intermediaries for insurance distribution services insofar as current rules do not expressly reflect this they will need to do so changes to icobs the fca will apply the idds overarching principles to all intermediaries carrying out insurance distribution activities regardless of whether or not they have direct customer contact the fca will give effect to these by amending the current icobs rules on communications and financial promotions to require that all marketing communications be clearly identifiable as such a new rule requiring insurance distributors to act honestly fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers and a new rule in sysc to prohibit remuneration and performance management practices that would conflict with the customer’s best interests rule icobs   to incorporate the idd requirements in respect of precontacts disclosure conflicts of interest and transparency the fca proposes to amend icobs  to align with the following idd requirements intermediaries must disclose if they have  or more voting rights or capital in an insurer or vice versa currently the requirement is “more than ” intermediaries must disclose if they give advice based on “a fair and personal” analysis of the market and where an intermediary is contractually bound to place business with a specific insurer or insurers it must provide the names of these insurers currently this information need only be supplied on request by the customer disclosure of firms remuneration arrangements the fca proposes to amend icobs  to incorporate the following idd requirements in respect of remuneration disclosure intermediaries must disclose the nature and basis of remuneration received in relation to the insurance contract being proposed eg bonuses for hitting a sales target where the specific contract sold will count directly towards that target insurers must likewise disclose the nature of remuneration paid to their employee and the amount of fee where remuneration is in the form of a fee paid by a customer the fca intends to provide guidance in icobs on the meaning of nature and basis with the former relating to the type of remuneration and the latter relating to the source of remuneration the consultation paper provides illustrative examples of statements that would not be compliant the fcas proposal concerns the effecting of the remuneration disclosure requirements under idd it does not propose to amend requirements relating to commission disclosure by intermediaries or impact any other obligations relevant to remuneration arising from general law the fca is also proposing to amend the definition of durable medium fee and remuneration in line with the idd means of communication to customers the fca proposes to incorporate the following idd requirements into icobs  information may be provided on paper a durable medium other than paper or a website where it is not a durable medium and satisfies certain conditions where information is provided through a medium other than paper the option to have the information on paper must be available and free of charge no provision for the information to be provided orally at the request of the customer telephone sales should comply with existing eu law in relation to distance marketing all the information required must be provided in a clear accurate and comprehensible manner in an official language of the member state and free of charge in terms of fees fca will amend its definition within the glossary to align with the idd definition icobs  standards for advised and nonadvised sale firms will need to i identify the customers demands and needs and match them to the available products and ii state the customers demands and needs to assist them in making an informed decision however the fca recognises the need for a clear distinction between advised and non advised sales it does not expect firms involved in nonadvised retail sales to carry out a detailed investigation of the customers circumstances but the firm should identify the customers demands and needs the fca offers illustrative examples in the consultation paper for advised sales the fca proposes a new requirement for firms which provide a personal recommendation to provide a personalised explanation as to why the proposed products best meet the customers insurance demands and needs amendments to icobs a – sales practices as discussed above the idd introduces new requirements where an insurance policy is sold in connection with or alongside other goods or services as part of a package or the same agreement where the insurance is ancillary to the main noninsurance product the customer must be able to buy the primary product without the insurance in the fcas view ancillary has a broad meaning and includes all instances where insurance is sold to complement other goods or services where insurance is not the primary product the idd requires the insurance distributor to inform the customer whether it is possible to buy the different components separately and if so shall provide an adequate description of the different components of the agreement or package as well as separate evidence of the costs and charges of each component complaints handling and outof court redress article  of the idd requires insurance and reinsurance distributors to have a process in place for customers and other eligible parties to register complaints and receive replies this requirement applies to all types of insurance transaction whether it involves a retail customer or a commercial customer including reinsurance transactions article  requires each member state to have in place effective alternative dispute resolution adr systems the fca will rely on the requirements of the disp sourcebook to implement these requirements and does not propose to extend the scope of jurisdiction of the fos wider than the current definition of eligible complaints to consider complaints from wider commercial customers although it is considering more generally whether to extend fos eligibility to larger smes than are currently covered additionally it will extend necessary requirements to all distributors when carrying out distribution activities the fca proposes to introduce a requirement for eea branches of uk reinsurers and intermediaries to comply with an adr entity in the eea state in which they are established to resolve consumer disputes
