immune response and epithelial barrier function primary indicationsinflammatory bowel disease development stagephase a hif stabilizer summary mechanism indications publications akb summary akb is a small molecule that stabilizes hypoxia inducible factorα hifα hifα is critical for the regulation of innate immune responses and maintenance of epithelial barrier function in the gastrointestinal tract we are developing akb as a oncedaily orallyadministered treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease how akb works the response to hypoxia reduced oxygen is a critical mechanism by which cells regulate metabolism immune function and many other adaptive responses hypoxiainducible factor hif is the primary transcriptional regulator of this response amongst its many properties hifα is a critical regulator of epithelial barrier function and the innate immune response stabilization of hifα has been shown to dramatically improve wound healing and immune response in the gut akb is a novel small molecule that stabilizes cellular levels of hifα by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase enzymes the primary enzymes responsible for the destruction of hifα indications akb is being developed for inflammatory bowel disease ibd it has shown outstanding efficacy for induction and maintenance in multiple models of inflammatory bowel disease by stabilizing hifα akb greatly reduces the severity of colitis as measured by reduction in clinical symptoms restoration of colon length and preservation of the barrier function our phase b trial will treat patients with ulcerative colitis publications

assess safety and tolerability of akb with preliminary results expected in q  september    am eastern daylight time cincinnatibusiness wireaerpio therapeutics inc today announced that it has dosed the first subject in a phase a clinical trial evaluating its product candidate akb for the treatment of ibd this novel orally administered agent that stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor  alpha hifα a cellular protein which plays a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation and maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity in multiple in vivo preclinical models of ibd akb has been shown to markedly reduce disease activity with decreased levels of inflammation and preservation of mucosal integrity akb also led to marked reductions in multiple inflammatory cytokines in plasma and colon tissue “initiating the clinical development program for akb represents a major milestone” commented kevin peters md aerpio’s chief scientific officer “akb has the potential to be the first orally administered agent to target both the resolution of inflammation and the restoration of epithelial barrier function the two major drivers of ibd pathogenesis” joseph gardner aerpio’s ceo stated “currently patients with moderate to severe ibd are treated with steroids or biologics both of which have significant side effects we believe that akb provides a groundbreaking treatment for ibd that could reduce the dependence of ibd patients on both steroids and biologics” about the akb study aerpio’s phase a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study is designed to enroll up to  healthy volunteers twelve individuals will receive placebo and  will receive akb in up to six dose cohorts in an ascendingdose design the study’s primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of
