you’re part of something new something exciting and something meaningful we live in a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial intelligence computer vision deep learning and natural language processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and everyday lives and for us one of the most interesting possibilities is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most our home ourstory the start of something big lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of stanford where our cto and cofounder hendrik dahlkamp worked on stanley stanford’s pioneering selfdriving car after being on the first team to ever win the darpa grand challenge for autonomous vehicles hendrik continued his work in sebastian thrun’s lab where he met our ceo and cofounder alex teichman an expert in semisupervised learning on d sensors the two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled advancements in computer vision and depth perception alex and hendrik saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative ways and lighthouse was born stanley the first autonomous vehicle to complete the mile darpa grand challenge course in the mojave desert ourteam our founders alex teichman — ceo and cofounder while receiving his phd in computer science alex led stanford’s research on selfdriving car perception inventing machine learning techniques that enabled selfdriving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead of requiring largescale human annotation intrigued by the potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial intelligence he was inspired to leverage these new technologies for realworld applications in the home alex has an undergrad degree in electrical engineering from the university of pennsylvania and a phd in computer science from stanford university hendrik dahlkamp — cto and cofounder hendrik previously cofounded two companies both acquired by google his work led to the

it possible to understand the motion of objects through space and time enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale quantitative testing person recognition nextlevel person identification our team of computer vision phds have built models that allow lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown faces and d sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that identify a known person by size shape or movement even when it can’t see a face action recognition action recognition beyond simple gestures using action recognition models

meaningful we live in a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial intelligence computer vision deep learning and natural language processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and everyday lives and for us one of the most interesting possibilities is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most our home ourstory the start of something big lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of stanford where our cto and cofounder hendrik dahlkamp worked on stanley stanford’s pioneering selfdriving car after being on the first team to ever win the darpa grand challenge for autonomous vehicles hendrik continued his work in sebastian thrun’s lab where he met our ceo and cofounder alex teichman an expert in semisupervised learning on d sensors the two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled advancements in computer vision and depth perception alex and hendrik saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative ways and lighthouse was born stanley the first autonomous vehicle to complete the mile darpa grand challenge course in the mojave desert ourteam our founders alex teichman — ceo and cofounder while receiving his phd in computer science alex led stanford’s research on selfdriving car perception inventing machine learning techniques that enabled selfdriving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead of requiring largescale human annotation intrigued by the potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial intelligence he was inspired to leverage these new technologies for realworld applications in the home alex has an undergrad degree in electrical engineering from the university of pennsylvania and a phd in computer science from stanford university hendrik dahlkamp — cto and cofounder hendrik previously cofounded two companies both acquired by google his work led to the creation of google street view google maps’ turnbyturn directions and gesture recognition that was incorporated into android’s technology he is a darpa grand challenge winner for stanley the first selfdriving car and was the first engineer at google x hendrik has a bs in computer science and math and an ms in computer science from karlsruhe institute of technology kit in germany he left stanford university’s phd program to become an entrepreneur
