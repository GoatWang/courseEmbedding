yourself and your coverage needs  see your customresults and start comparing multiple quotes as you are shopping around there are certain questions that you should ask yourself the best one to start with is “how much coverage do i need” to give you an idea most people opt for a term policy with about  in coverage why this amount or any amount for that matter the answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones another good question to ask yourself or one of the several qualified agents lifeplanscom can connect you with is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you unlike a term policy which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years a permanent policy does not expire typically whole life the most common type of permanent insurance not only serves to payout your beneficiaries upon your passing but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashedout anytime essentially permanent policies are investments and can grow in value

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
