biosimilars   immunogenicity screening the induction of antidrug antibodies ada in patients is a major concern in the development of biological therapeutics detecting and quantifying adas is of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry because any immune response against a therapeutic can affect the safety pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of the drug the fda strongly recommends the implementation of immunogenicity assays that detect quantitate and characterize adas using biosensors to detect ada is important because they can detect low affinity antidrug antibodies ada that elisa or msd meso scale discovery assays may miss robust fluidics design and detection capabilities in complex solutions reliable microfluidics cartridge supports the use of high concentrations of human serum no clogging – handles complex mixtures increased uptime – no replacement needed rapid screening  detection screens  samples in  hours × mode screens x faster detects weakly binding ada in initial immune response easily determines subclasses and isotypes of antibodies allows for quantitative measurements of antibody dissociation rates biosimilar development according to the fda guidance on demonstrating biosimilarity to a reference product april  “rigorous structural and functional comparisons that show minimal or no difference between the proposed product and the reference product will strengthen the scientific justification for a selective and targeted approach to animal andor clinical testing to support a demonstration of biosimilarity… in vitro assays may include biological assays binding assays and enzyme kinetics” the pi will help you demonstrate similar binding kinetics to the original biologic product equivalent binding affinity to fcɣr and fcrn equivalent stoichiometry of binding the amount of active material equal or lower immunogenicity confirmatory immunogenicity screen fragmentbased screening a significant trend in small molecule drug discovery is the growth in fragmentbased screening many pharmaceutical and biotech companies need to cover more “chemical space” to develop new drugs and find that fragmentbased screening is an excellent tool spr is one of the top techniques for screening fragment libraries that typically range in size from  da to  da the bioptix pi accurately and reliably measures binding of low mw compounds down to  da screens up to  fragmentsday   experimental flexibility with two injection modes the pi allows for flexibility in experimental design × mode where four samples can be injected simultaneously over four flow cells enables x the throughput of serial flow cell biosensors × mode is used for generating high quality double referenced data for kinetic analysis   active concentration analysis the bioptix pi can give the concentration of active protein rather than total protein obtained by absorbance important during protein production and assay development can be quicker and easier than elisa unique flow

compromises when purchasing laboratory instruments you usually have to choose between cost and some measure of quality the pi enhanced surface plasmon resonance system exists to break that norm it offers scientists that require labelfree realtime detection of biomolecular interactions an extremely high sensitivity low noise instrument at a price point that is hundreds of thousands of dollars less than systems with equivalent performance the pi concurrently offers industryleading reliability easy to use software for experimental design and instrument control and greater experimental flexibility unrivalled performance per dollar with sensitivity down to  da an extremely low noise profile and an affordable price no other spr instrument comes close to giving you as much performance per dollar as the pi you can finally get industryleading spr performance without the exorbitant price tag built for reliability most spr flow cells are prone to clogging and require regular replacement – often twice per year these kinds of flow cells are not covered under warranty and cost many thousands of dollars to replace the pi’s fluidics cartridge is designed to prevent blockages and can be readily unclogged if necessary we’re so confident that our fluidics cartridges will live a long and fruitful life we warranty them for two years your pi will not only have a lower operating cost than other spr systems but you’ll have less downtime as well you can even run more viscous and complex solutions such as human serum without fear of clogging features of the bioptix pi include phasebased spr for high sensitivity  injector   flow cell design for increased throughput allowing for multiplexed kinetic measurements increased uptime – unique fluidic system – no annual replacement required standard  custom surface chemistries advanced fluidic system for fast kinetic measurements inline degassing supplied with industry standard scrubber  software cost effective and simple to operate biological applications proteinsmall molecule interactions proteinprotein interactions antibodyantigen interactions kinetics  affinities affinity maturation epitope binning nucleic acidprotein interactions biomolecule concentration measurements immunogenicity screening enhanced throughput  flexibility the bioptix pi utilizes a four needle autosampler and four parallel flow cells this allows operation in a mode that provides four times the throughput of an ordinary spr instrument while maintaining the sensitivity that users demand the pi can also be operated in a high resolution mode for more detailed analysis of molecular interactions making spr easier than ever the pi is easier to use than any other spr system especially for users who are not already experts in spr our software for instrument control and experimental design has a simple intuitive drag  drop interface the pi’s software can be used while the instrument is in operation allowing one user to design an experiment while another is running an experiment less user maintenance is required because of our ultrareliable flow cell design spr is all we do so every member of our support team is a dedicated spr expert

bioptix diagnostics inc “bdi” which we acquired in september  we have developed a proprietary enhanced surface plasmon resonance technology platform for the detection of molecular interactions  we acquired a surface plasma resonance spr platform which seeks to combine high sensitivity with microarray detection capability to allow researchers to understand whether their target molecules have functionality against the disease targeted spr is an advanced and highly sensitive optical technology that can measure refractive index changes on a sensor chip’s gold surface due to a change in mass that occurs during a binding event this change can be used to monitor biological interactions such as the concentration of target molecules kinetic rates and affinity constants bdi is a life science tools company that provides an affordable solution for drug discovery scientists who require labelfree realtime detection of biomolecular interactions  bdi manufactures sells and services instruments and consumables to pharmaceutical researchers allowing them to develop new drugs faster than by using older technologies such as enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or “elisa” bdi was originally established with technology developed in conjunction with dr john l “jan” hall adjoint professor jila university of colorado who shared the nobel prize for physics in  for his work on laserbased precision spectroscopy and the optical frequency comb technique spr is the core of the bdi products and intellectual property  dr hall in conjunction with the scientists at bdi created a common path interferometer that was commercialized to become the pi instrument effective january   we adopted a plan to exit this acquired business and commenced a significant reduction in the workforce the decision to adopt this plan was made following an evaluation by the company’s board of directors in january  of the estimated results of operations projected during the near to midterm period for bdi including consideration of product development required and updated sales forecasts and estimated additional cash resources required  we are reviewing possible strategic alternatives relative to the business to maximize shareholder value our continuing evaluation following adoption of the plan estimates that we will incur charges to operations in early  of approximately  million consisting of  writedown of tangible and intangible assets estimated at approximately  million and  winddown severance and transaction expenses estimated at approximately  following the recent decision to exit the bdi business we have begun evaluating potential strategic alternatives we expect in the near term to establish the primary criteria we will consider as we evaluate our next steps and strategic path forward with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders additionally we will focus on attempting to locate an acquirer or partner for the bdi operations as well as continuing to attempt to locate an interested party for the appendicitis assets we also hold an exclusive license agreement with washington university “wu” in st louis which granted us an exclusive license and right to sublicense its technology for veterinary products worldwide subject to certain exceptions  in july  we granted ceva sante animale sa “ceva” an exclusive royaltybearing license to our intellectual property and other assets relating to recombinant single chain reproductive hormone technology for use in nonhuman mammals  this license includes a sublicense of the technology licensed to us by wu
