heart of the mother lode region presently the carson hill project is in its first stage of gold extraction and refinery processing on september   the california environmental protection agency through the central valley regional water quality control board determined that the pilot test process implemented by oro east at carson hill successfully renders the mining waste in the wmus “class c” waste previously before oro east acquired the wmus the waste there was classified as “class b” the positive impact on the environment and sustainability of mining operations in the area is tremendous given the reclassification approval the classification system is based on the california mining waste regulations mining waste in california falls into one of three classifications  group a this is considered toxic and presents the highest environmental threat to water quality  group b this is considered semitoxic and presents a significant environmental threat to water quality  group c this is considered nontoxic and presents insignificant to no threat to water quality why is this important group a and group b classified waste can cause acid rain and adversely affect the ph level in ground water previously the carson hill mining waste in the wmus were classified as group b mining waste however after oro east’s innovative refinery system proven through its pilot testing program the california environmental protection agency ca epa through the regional water board determined that the waste can now be classified as class c as class b mining waste oro east would be governed by chapter  division  title  on hazardous waste generator requirements this introduces a host of regulations and close monitoring by the ca epa requiring high cost liners containment systems certified proposals and strategic containment plans and heavy government oversight specifically how class b mining waste is discharged will be closely monitored by the government and requires agency approval before any plan or discharge can take effect however class c mining waste has no such applicable regulations so long as mining waste is considered class c there are no compliance regulations in effect and class c mining waste can be discharged at will because any form of discharge of class c mining waste is automatically considered in compliance with all applicable water quality control plans
