empire by matt chaban •  am “you have to try the hot chocolate–it’s the best hot chocolate in town” david swinghamer said the yearold ceo of shake shack was perched atop a neonorange stool at the back of the newish shack at the corner of th and eighth “especially on a day like today” it was friday dec  yet again below freezing the sky was a glacial blue and the wind whipped down the avenue and yet the line formed as it does every day at three other new york locations and one in miami office workers theatergoers tourists all awaiting the same thing a shackburger and maybe one of those eponymous shakes such lines–for what are simple quintessentially american meals that could be had in innumerable locales for less money–has led mr swinghamer along with his longtime business partner danny meyer to take a shot at stealing the king’s crown of toppling the golden arches of going global with new york’s shake shack “we came to the realization–are we serious about this are we going to do one or two or are we really going to give this a shot and prove that our culture can grow that the quality is there no matter the size” mr swinghamer said eating a crinklecut french fry for  that means four new stores in the states all in the northeast westport conn washington dc battery park city and a longawaited brooklyn outlet two others are planned for dubai and kuwait city “we want every shake shack to be better than the last” mr swinghamer said “there’s no way we’re going to go backward like so many others who expand too big or too fast” sorry hold on he rose from his stool for the third or fourth time during lunch walked over to the huge swinging back door next to the “handcrafted in brooklyn”stamped table and shut it it had gotten stuck again and cold air was gusting inside confused patrons did not realize the entrance the line was at the front of the shack not on the corner returning to the table mr swinghamer took out a business card and scribbled a reminder to have the door fixed it was working exactly as designed but he would no doubt engineer a way around that it is this attention to detail such a hallmark of the danny meyer brand that landed mr swinghamer the job of running the now semiautonomous shake shack asked over the phone why he had selected him mr meyer demurred he said his four partners had a certain everyman expertise that allowed them to share roles within the company as for the expansion “it was going to be one of my partners and there was not anyone who came close in terms of skill set to get this done” mr meyer allowed of mr swinghamer for one thing mr swinghamer is the only partner with what mr meyer said was “multiunit” experience having spent a dozen years in chicago working for richard melman at lettuce entertain you a pioneer in the haute chain business before that he spent three forgettable years with chichi’s he joined mr meyer in  agreeing to the move after the pair shared a cubscardinals game that turned into dinner and drinks neither man could remember who won the game yet mr swinghamer’s chief asset is one he never thought he would use after abandoning it in college a few years spent studying architecture at the university of minnesota where he also fell in love with restaurants while working as a line cook to pay for school “each shake shack has a certain sense of place a feel and while the burger is the same the signage isn’t even from madison square to the upper west side” he explained “a shake shack in brooklyn is not going to be a shake shack in dupont circle and that is why we–i really–pick all the locations even just which side of the street to put it on matters” he could have been lecturing at pratt that deliberativeness is why it took four years to settle on a restaurant in brooklyn that it would be a shake shack that it would be on the fulton mall and not coney island it is the reason mr swinghamer moved the stage  feet forward at jazz standard to create a more intimate setting with diners it is the reason a shack in nolita was abandoned because some neighbors objected even though the majority of them did not it is the reason there are lines “when we opened the second shake shack we really thought we’d see a dip at first” mr swinghamer said “but instead sales went up in madison square park now we have four and last year was our best year ever and that’s the idea behind this expansion not only to make every store better but to make all of them better” just then a class of highschool kids from bedstuy filed in looking for lunch after a field trip “that’s what’s so exciting about an expansion–to find the right location such as downtown brooklyn we make really a lot of people happy” mr swinghamer said “it’s not targeting a certain narrow demographic” and with that he got up to close the door behind them mchaban at observercom  mcnyo see also midtown girl alexa ray joel goes ahead with her own life at the plaza’s oak room national politics observer delivered to your
