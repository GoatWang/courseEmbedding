home annual reports schedule of investments prospectus shareholder information how to investredeem fund performance about sequoia fund about us sequoia fund is a mutual fund advised by ruane cunniff  goldfarb inc since its founding in  in managing the fund ruane cunniff pursues a valueoriented approach seeking to outperform over the longterm by purchasing shares at prices below our estimated range of their intrinsic values in highquality businesses that have significant and durable competitive advantages and that we believe can compound the funds capital at attractive rates over the longterm we invest with the mindset of a business owner because we believe that the only reliable way to value stocks and invest in them successfully is to think of them as interests in the longterm profits of a business the longterm perspective we take informs how we think what we do and how we construct our portfolios we focus exclusively on things we can understand like the quality of a business franchise the competence of a management team and the structure of an industry rather than factors we consider inherently unpredictable like the direction of the economy or the sentiment of the stock market we spend virtually all of our time researching the strengths weaknesses and prospects of individual companies because this work is painstaking and difficult we focus our holdings on a small group of businesses this focus allows us to know what we own and should also allow us to outperform if we use our research to make thoughtful judgments our team investment committee analysts david poppe arman

recently held our annual investor day for sequoia shareholders and other clients of ruane cunniffgoldfarb the following comments were made by bob goldfarb at that meeting a transcript of the questionandanswer portion of the meeting will be mailed to you with the second quarter report in augustthe seeds of the housing bubble were planted in the early years of this decade by the federal reserve whenit reduced interest rates down close to zero in an effort to mitigate the severity of the recession that followedthe bursting of the dotcom bubble now we are concerned that the necessary massive leveraging recentlytaken on by the us government in order to offset the enormous deleveraging by the private sector may containthe germination of the next bubble the prospect of borrowing yearafteryear at a high singledigitlow doubledigit percentage of gdp will result in the us government facing its own debt crisis lurching from one crisisto another addressing each crisis by planting the seeds of the next one is not a good ideathe us government has two enormous advantages over the private sector it has the power to tax and ithas the ability to print currency that the rest of the world will accept however there will be seriousconsequences to using either of these tools excessively going forwarda partial solution to funding the debt will be a welcome increase in the savings rates of americans formore than  years after world war ii the us personal savings rate generally hovered between  percentof household income with spikes up to  percent in recessions beginning in the late s the personalsavings rate began to trend downward finally turning negative in  the savings rate had not previouslybeen negative since  at the depths of the great depressionafter hovering near zero in recent years the personal savings rate quickly rose to  percent of income indecember in each of the first three months of  it has been between  and  percent the suddenupward movement in the savings rate has corresponded with an abrupt decline in the demand for consumergoods the recent leveling off of the savings rate also squares with the stabilization in sales that a number of retailers of lowticket nondurable goods such as target are currently experiencingat this point we do not know whether the savings rate will stabilize between  and  percent or revert tothe high single digit rate that was the norm for many decades the marginal propensity of the consumer tosave more and spend less has very significant implications for the future growth rate of the economy as wellas for future earnings levels and growth rates of many companieswe are seeing other changes in consumer behavior that we suspect are largely structural in nature as webelieve is the increase in savings a simple example the growth of private label brands poses a real threat tomany branded consumer products companies although private label market share typically rises duringrecessions and then contracts in more healthy times we think that this time much of the growth in privatelabel is likely to be sustained once you realize that the laundry and the dishes look the same when you usecostco’s kirkland signature detergent instead of tide or cascade you will probably reduce your purchases of procter gamble goods by a couple hundred dollars a year if millions of people make the same decisionit will result in significantly less revenue and less pricing power for procter gamble and its competitors andmore power and possibly higher profit margins for the large retailersanother example of pricing sensitivity affecting industry dynamics is in private passenger auto insurancehistorically the direct writers led by berkshire’s geico and our former holding progressive have enjoyedsteady growth in market share at the expense of the captive writers such as state farm and allstate in recentmonths however the direct response writers have enjoyed a growth spurt in terms of new policies writtenthere are some indications that this growth is coming at the expense of not only the captive channel but also fifth avenue suite new york ny     the independent agency channel which had been relatively stable for many years if the shift toward the directwriters continues it will impact not only the topline growth of the captive writers and possibly the agencychannel but will also affect their margins more shopping means retentions are lower and policy lives shorterprofitability is extremely sensitive to policy lives as renewals are a lot more profitable than new policiesclearly the consumer is looking for ways to save money in this regard we feel that some of our holdingsare very well positioned these would certainly include the retailers walmart and costco as well as tjx andclearly berkshire’s geico is going to be a winner these businesses are low cost providers and have beengaining market share in the last year with tjx and geico particularly strong in recent months for examplein apriltjx’s marshalls and tj maxx stores generated same store sales growth of  percent versus a negative percent for macy’s and a negative  percent for kohl’s we cannot remember when the spread between tjx’ssame store comparisons and those of macy’s and kohl’s were as wide as they were in april this bodes wellfor tjx because unlike most apparel retailers its traffic counts have been uptjx typically gains new shoppers during recessions and tends to keep them even as conditions improve if the consumer remains stretched they are even more likely to retain them i would not bet on that same spreadcontinuing month after month year after year but it will be interesting to watch going forwardas we have mentioned in our prior letters to you we did reduce our exposure to stocks of consumerdiscretionary companies in  in  there has been a further reduction and as we said in our last letterwe are operating with a bias toward further reducing our consumer discretionary investments subject of course to fluctuations in stock prices but as the illustrations i have given you indicate we do not think allconsumer discretionary stocks or companies are necessarily going to be disadvantaged even in a much moreaustere and frugal environment for consumers clearly tjx costco and walmart have benefited one of ourbest performers in the last  months has been o’reilly automotive whose sales have benefited from the lowlevel of new car sales and the resulting need for many owners of older cars to finally undertake longdeferredmaintenance if they want to keep driving just as these trends in consumer behavior will not adversely affect all consumer discretionary businessesit is not simply consumer discretionary businesses that will continue to be adversely affected by the trends weare seeing in the economy we see numerous strong companies in many other industries suffering frommassively contracting demand and corresponding declines in sales and earnings illinois tool works a formerholding of ours reported organic revenues for the three months ended april of negative  percent thisis a figure we would not have dreamt of before last octoberin this environment we find it very challenging to ascertain normalized earnings power for manycompanies – both those we own and those that we are considering owning – when we are not sure what“normal” will look like in the futurewe are not alone here we have met with a number of ceos of companies which we either own or areconsidering owning when we ask them to estimate their companies normalized earnings power many willvolunteer that they do not know when pressed to give a broad range oftentimes they cannot and usuallydecline to opinevaluing companies without knowing their earning power is like flying into a dense fog without instrumentsin our many years of investing we cannot remember a time when visibility was this low and estimating theintrinsic value of businesses was this challengingas a result of
