purchase construction end date dec  love our home  out of  reviewed on jul   we built the dakar  which was completed in dec  this was a knockdown rebuild and our first experience building over the space of a year we looked at many display homes and by coincidence we ended up deciding on the first one we ever entered which was the dakar we chose porter davis because they had the only façade which i liked after trauling the websites of the many other builders around i also thought they had a reputable name but more of a quality builder than metricon and simmons which we could also tell by the workmanship in read more the display homes on comparison things moved along slowly with our original sales rep who we had sought out and tried to gain and assess information on such as how the basic process of building ran what choice we had over the plan could we change things extend etc she took time to answer our questions via email sometimes going on holiday and sick leave where we wouldn’t get an answer for a few weeks and have no one else’s contact details to get in touch with she was a friendly person though and could relate her personal experience of building on to us i felt she never knew the direct answers to our questions and always had to find out then took ages in coming back to us we always had to follow her up what we were trying to accomplish of course was to find out what the cost would be to then find out how much we need to borrow and get an approved amount from the bank to know if this would be something we could afford to do or whether we were wasting our time the whole process in full was a need one thing for the bank and one for the builder and one before the other it was very stressful we never even knew the final price at the first contract signing which was very nerve racking as if you don’t’ sign you can’t continue it was a real leap of faith by this point in time our sales rep who spent a few nights over at our place chatting was gone and never heard from again as she had registered her ‘sale’ we were then passed on to name removed who was an absolute nightmare to deal with wouldn’t answer calls or email when she did answer an email she would address one out of  of our questions she ‘finished up’ at porter davis towards the end of our build but our time dealing with her was definitely the most stressful we felt she had no manager or no one we could report to above her when she wasn’t responding to us or solving our queries or her mistakes she made many mistakes some could have been detrimental to our build and if it wasn’t for me being on maternity leave and finding time to double check everything she did there would have been so many mistakes at this point we had demolished and signed everything and were going ahead with the build we were really left wondering what was going to happen with no one to talk to or contact world of style yes we went a few times as they suggest you do so its not so overwhelming it still was though there was an occasion where we were denied assistance because we hadn’t signed a contract yet and the ‘assistant’ straight out told us that people come there steal their ideas and then build elsewhere again making the time to travel into the city with kids in toe is not an easy feat to be denied assistance for that reason when we had all intentions of building with them pd were not flexible in any way shape or form to fit in with your life or situations so as it turned out our appointment to set in stone our fixtures and fittings was a week after my due date so we expected to have to make all of those important decision with a week old baby with us however i was late so we had no choice but to attend the appointment and hope for the best as there was no changing this appointment my waters broke choosing kitchen benchtops and we had to leave halfway through our muchanticipated appointment to give birth we live on the other side of the city so it was again a very stressful labour in the car to the hospital they allowed us to come back and finish the appointment we then had another contract signing date a week or so after giving birth which is a whole day in a glass office with a newborn signing your life away not a good experience the lack of flexibility to move appointments around for world of style was extremely poor and they should be embarrassed by that i should make mention of what is not a standard inclusion we kept it to a bare minimum of upgrades and it still reached almost k for us in extras so be aware the price you see on the website will never be the amount you pay things started to look up when the actual building started and we were allocated name removed as our site supervisor there were a few structural mistakes that flowed through from the extremely bad admin manager name removed but we checked in almost daily picked mistakes up early let name removed know who would fix the few major things early name removed ran the groups of tradies like clockwork and our house was built in  months we had a bad taste in our mouth from the experience so far and i can say name removed turned that around by the end of the build and we began to feel we had someone to trust finally we never made appointments with name removed but it was easy enough to drop in regularly and see the progress which was reassuring for us to check each stage our admin manager to replace name removed was name removed name removed was fine but by that point everything was completely between us and name removed and the job of admin role was completed name removed sent us the last few invoices and that part of the process with her was fine i wished we had of had her the whole way though we were just unlucky i guess with name removed name removed worked hard to get us in our new home as quickly as possible and achieved handing over the keys at the beginning of dec getting us in before xmas we have had the  month inspection we only had minor issues which are normal with getting a house up so quickly everything was assessed and has been addressed really quickly you can just work in with the tradies for those things the quality and standard of tradies pd use are high i couldn’t have been happier with everyone i met and their attitude to the work we love our new home well  months old now having had the experience i would build with pd again as i would know what to expect and how to better prepare with the issues we had better the devil you know scenario i would still be cautious and try to get a satisfaction guarantee on who we would be working with in the admin office though don’t expect or rely on world of style to offer suggestions of expertise in areas you have no experience in either maybe ask someone you know in the trade or go to a home show or something for ideas on what works it’s hard but try not to let them rush you through one last thing they had everything in my husbands name this meant i was never included in the emails and my husband had to forward everything to me they even had the contract only in his name but we got that changed they never changed anything else which annoying left me out of the loop and even today i cant post this review because my details dont match the proof of purchase document ahhh the admin similar opinion write a review was this review helpful yes sponsored looking

amazing home the workmanship and build quality of our property is beautiful there were certainly challenges and delays along the way however together with our team at porter davis i think we overcame

lots to work through over the course of the build and she always did her best to help us and went above and beyond my expectations she is fantastic i think she was new to start and she got better and better there was a situation where we lost our first site supervisor unexpectedly so we were given hardworking name removed who took over for us and did a fantastic job to catch it up and keep working with us to get it back on track and get it right of course there were problems and delays along the way but i think that is expected in building and name removed was awesome at bringing it all together in the end we were very reassured with name removed  the overall are manager being available to speak with us at certain times its important that all listened to us honestly and authentically the customer service and support all the way through from world of style was pretty good handover was delayed a few times to get the house perfect for us but it was worth it because once we got the

nothing was a problem and even when we changed our choice of house after wos it was not a problem and went beyond the duty of her job to make it all smooth for us then we were handed over to a bc no was very friendly and good but had to change with in a month or so to bc and within a few weeks just as we were getting used to her we were told she was no more our bc so came bc she started and finished with us really friendly but we had some issues in between where she made a mistake and was going to c read more harge us for that mistake if we did not have all our emails available there would have been some extra charges applied to us in a form of variation the final housevery very happy but it took a lot to get there what i highly recommend is that know your rights and fight for them our situation was that we selected a lot of extra perks that were offered and they were happy to take the money for it but did not do all the necessary adjustments so that the house is finished as it should be ex we paid extra for the highest ceiling and even more again to raise the front entrance by cm which was offered as option well that was all fine and good but they did not change the height of the facade to accommodate this rise and the house looked half shut with panels coming down to their base height from the ground even the outside lights were fixed at their standard height from the ground rather than being raised to accommodate the height of the house something to watch out for we had to fight and threaten to go to consumer affairs before they agreed to fixed the facade also watch out for the level of your concrete to make sure they level it well especially if you are doing the floors yourself we also had one major issue which we will not mention as we think it is a human error and we believe would not happen often but was very significant and if pd would contact us will discuss with them personally we had two on site managers and were both good except for the problems mentioned earlier and other minor issues we found that the different departments were disconnected at at times did not know who was supposed to do what a lot of the questions that we were told would be answered by wos were not answered and were told then that it will be answered at contract and so on which did not make sense because you want to know everything before signing a contract we must say everything was finally addressed even though extremely stressful and frustrating at the time we are happy with our house we also feel if we did not know enough and fight we would have ended up with an inferior house we would build with pd again as we dont think they are any worse than others have built before similar opinion write a review was this review helpful yes comments

private message verified purchase construction end date dec  still waiting for our house  out of  reviewed on jul   our biggest mistake was to employ porter davis to build our dream home in october  we were assured by the sales consultant that pd could build a house on our property and it would be completed around christmas time  after obtaining the fire and bal rating reports we paid the deposit in january  over the next few months we had appointments at the wos and in june  we were to sign the tender document it was then that we found out that pd would not obtain the planning permit despite being told previously that they would do t read more his for us on the th august  we signed the contract with to be confirmed items still to be quoted for this was a big mistake on our part as these tbc items added an estimated  increase in the price of the house as we were required to obtain the planning permit pd would not issue the house plans to us to submit to local council until the contract had been signed we would still be waiting for them if we hadnt signed the contract the planning permit was issued in november  and we are still waiting for the building permit to be applied for eight months later three building coordinators and two more senior personal later we are still waiting for our nightmare to be resolved it is now nearly  months since we signed the contract and pd is still throwing delay after delay at us with the most pathetic excuses we have spent considerable time and money clearing the site creating a driveway for access installing an underground electrical pit and water tank obtaining the fire report and bal rating and the council planning permit and still the first sod of earth is yet to be turned in april  fifteen months after paying the initial deposit we met with a pd representative to discuss three options for moving forward with this project after stringing us along for so long he told us that pd did not want to build on our site as it was not in their normal building criteria our site is a gently sloping easily accessible  acre block which any competent builder would find very simple to build on needless to say all this has caused us unnecessary distress upset frustration and a terrible toll on our health we are in our late sixties early seventies and instead of enjoying our dream house it has become an ongoing unrelenting

had a good feeling about porter davis the way they presented themselves on their website their display houses and the salesperson we talked to they were a class above the other builders we talked to our salesperson name removed was excellent in getting things done the contract process was tedious as you would expect with some mistakes here and there but overall it was well documented and our building coordinator name removed was easy to deal with and very responsive all the errors were read more quickly fixed world of style was very impressive and helpful and allowed us to make quick and easy decisions the build process was stressful and the least enjoyable but manageable with the help of our building coordinator and sometimes the site supervisor however the site supervisor was probably the least easy person to deal at pd especially after our private inspectors found some minor issues with workmanship the build was on time and within budget with no major surprises it finished quick perhaps too quick to our liking we had private inspections throughout the build for extra peace of mind my main complaints of the build were at handover when the site supervisor left pd

missing light bulbs and tiles missing in the balcony etc some problems have been quickly solved after handover but some problems are still waiting to be fixed hope these problems could be fixed soon  at preconstruction stage i waited for more than one year for the building permit and during this process my building coordinator was changed four times this was really frustrating since every building coordinator gave different information to me which made me confused the nd building coordinator told me that the waive of overlooking issue of the terrace was approved by the council however the next building coordinator said the council would never approve to remove the screening on the terrace i had to install screenings on both side of the terrace so why i need a terrace with m height screening and cannot see anything outside the nice adjustable shutters installed in terrace of display houses was not permitted by the council by the way but no one told me that beforehand and nobody told me why the building permit took so long and just kept me waiting  at the stage of world of style selection the designer just didnt help in anything he did not give any useful advice on the selection what he did was just pushing us to make the decision as quick as possibleit was really terrible experience after the handover we actually found that we made some unwise choices and we regret not to appoint a thirdparty interior designer  at the stage of sale this was the most fascinating stage i believe the sales representative promised everything but nothing came true at the end the sales said we could increase the ceiling height for both ground and first floor but after we signed the contract the building coordinator told us that our house was too high due to the facade we choose and the council asked us to decrease the ceiling height for both floors we intended to change to a lower facade then we can keep the ceiling height but we were not allowed to simply because we had already signed the contract the sales promised we only needed to cover one side of the terrace due to the overlooking issue with a nice looking shutter or obscure glaze eventually we covered both side of the terrace with m height ugly screening similar opinion write a review was this review helpful yes comments porter davis homes official hi bm thank you for the feedback of your experience and the service

our new home would build again just not soon   out of  reviewed on jul   we have just built for the first time through porter davis we fell in love with one of their designs and were confident to go with them as they have more good reviews than other big builders the workmanship and quality appears good although we have only been in for  weeks we did employ an independent inspector which we were glad we did they picked up lots of things in the build process that werent to the code or specs and these were fixed by our site supervisor upon receiving the report yes porter davis do have an independent inspec read more tor but at the end of the day they are being paid by porter davis we saw one of their reports for preslab pour which was a single page stating it was compliant our inspector picked up a number of defects however our build was managed well by the building consultant and site supervisors we had  over the build the world of style process definitely means you need to visit in advance and know what you want for selections day it was annoying that a number of our selections were incorrectly noted on the day meaning we had to get them changed and sometimes after multiple requests they still werent changed we also didnt have time for a wardrobe consult but werent advised this until we asked and told we would have to make one in our own time another day if we had known we could have done this in advance one quirk with pd is that some things which are installed in a display home arent allowed ie plumbing and niche on the same wall downlights above the shower if something is shown in a display home hold your ground and keep requesting it we got the nice and plumbing on the same wall by taking a photo of a display with it you wont get the downlight though as apparently they are taken out when the house is sold it is critical to go through your tender in detail ours was much much higher than we were expecting and we found we were being double charged for items such as manual handling and roller doors every time you get plans recheck everything as we found many items reverted back to original despite a previous version having our correct choices make sure you have everything in writing and document all your conversations we were charged for things we were told were included and i had all versions of our sales quote and plans with me along with records of conversation so we were able to show we had clearly been sold the build was ontime  a couple of weeks early which was a really nice surprise there are still a few things to be fixed and i feel that pds final handover process could be improved we had multiple dates for handover and a big list of items to be fixed from our pci however at handover these werent all complete which is fair enough as some things take time ie weeks to order a new window to replace a scratched one yet we are required to sign a doc stating they have been rectified before we are given the keys overall while the process was sometimes quite stressful building with porter davis was a good experience we love our new house we would choose to build again with porter davis but im not planning on

left us unhappy and annoyed with the whole experience we thought our time at the world of style was successful and pleasant but how wrong we were to be after about  months we started the build process and we received call after call that we hadnt made certain selections that was due to the staff at world of style not recording our selection properly so after confirming what we had selected we then had to sign variation after variation and charged extra fees as some of our selections we read more re actually an upgrade thus leaving us out of pocket after the home loan valuation had been approved yet we made  change and we were charged  administration fee our building coordinator changed  times and by the rd time we had a really good person helping us she was by far the best person working for porter davis a number of mistakes were made by porter davis and they tried to charge us for their mistakes and changes we refused to pay and they eventually agreed to cover the costs during the building stage our construction supervisor never contacted us during the first  stages and it was us chasing him up to inspect each stage we did the defects walk through about  hours which was a complete waste of time as the majority of them werent even completed it was as though the tape had just been pulled off some of the blue tape was even left on i have contacted the construction manager a week ago and have had no follow up to any complaints i lodged i eventually had to call him again to find out what was happening the quality of work is poor although they will tell you they have good

just for pre plaster stage june th  update extremely disappointed as per the contract we signed manhole need to be installed in ensuite bathroom when it came to install the heating system building coordinator sent an email advising that they cannot install manhole in ensuite bathroom because of heating unit therefore need to relocate it in bedroom we strongly disagreed having manhole installed in bedroom as it ruins look of entire bedroom and we dont get good feeling when sleep under it  days ago paid site visit with site supervisor and we were shocked to see old school manhole has been installed in bedroom up on requesting from building coordinator how they installed manhole in different location without contract variation signed and ignoring original structure plan we signed building coordinator sent an email with following comments and went silent since then no respond to our emails or calls  building coordinator wrote “should you be unwilling to accept the  credit and agree to the location of the manhoe your home will need to be placed on hold until you are willing to proceed there is not other alternative location for the manhole and we will be unable to proceed further until you have signed the attached variation agreeing to this change i have attached the variation stating the change in location and the  credit please sign and return this by close of

removed was easily contactable most of the time but always had any issues resolved within a day or two the service was amazing really considering the amount of builds at differing stages the bcs are working on at any one time we actually enjoyed the world of style process and really appreciated the advice given to us regarding our selections kitchen culture were excellent as was the service from birk blinds we went there  or  times before the actual selection day including doing all our electrical selections which made the day a lot less stressful i’m sure as there is a lot to get done we were also very happy with our tender presenter name removed she had great technical knowledge and any questions and issues that we had were easily answered or resolved on the day once the build started we met our site supervisor name removed again we were fortunate to be assigned a competent and caring operator for the duration of the build i would be lying if i said everything went smoothly be aware that if a subcontractor damages your neighbour’s property than that is between the subcontractor and your neighbour it is apparently not porter davis’ responsibility but having said that dean did everything in his power to help with the eventual resolution of the issue name removed was relatively easy to contact and was always amenable to an onsite meeting with myself or to arrange access for my independent inspector as a tradie himself he was very knowledgeable about the end to end process and definitely added value to our build building started in april and finished in september well within the estimated timeframe handover was relatively painless with only a few minor issues found they weren’t all resolved immediately but the remaining very minor issues were resolved after the  month inspection which also went very smoothly in short according to our independent inspector new home inspections we have a solid wellbuilt home building a home is always going to be stressful but that stress can be alleviated by working with competent caring people which we were lucky enough to encounter i would give a  star review if i could because nothing is perfect and i still have a sour taste in my mouth because of a less than professional painting company engaged by pd and even though our post handover issues were minor i would recommend not paying the final invoice until everything

of sense world of style a great concept however at times it appeared a little convoluted when trying to change things after we had left an included meal would be nice when going through especially considering you when you build with other volume builders they include lunch the contract process  the second and most critical part of the construction process we were lucky we were given an amazing consultant for this section of the build i bombarded her with emails and changes and she did her best to get back to me and facilitate everything she could my only problem i have with this area of the build is how pd have a single consultant for what at times seems like  people this means that my consultant on a normal  hour week has on my  house has  minutes per week to deal with any of my issues an improvement would possibly be to have a maximum amount of clients that a consultant can manage because it is very frustrating when you attempt to call your bc and cannot get onto them because they are snowed under the build my construction supervisor ss was amazing to deal with i could not have asked for a better or more professional supervisor he spent the time to go through any item i raised
