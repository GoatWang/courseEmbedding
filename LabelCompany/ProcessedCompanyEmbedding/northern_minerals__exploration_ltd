gas prices by acquiring properties with established production and upside potential for improvement in production we believe the best way for us to generate value is to grow the business by identifying acquiring and developing resource propertiesprojects in known producing areas within our niche operating area management’s strategy includes but is not limited to the following establish a solid cash flow foundation from low risk oil and gas projects place into production existing wells on leases acquired seek additional leases andor drilling prospects with low risk preferably with infield drilling purchase existing production with undrilled locations pursue strategic acquisitions with significant oil  gas potential to joint venture andor market   management’s niche area of operations is central texas where its team has over  years’ experience in drillingcompleting acquiring and operating oil and gas wells our team is focused on taking a very conservative approach in its initial stages of development to build a solid positive cash flow   summary of oil  gas projects coleman county texas – three well reworkrecompletion project in october  the company entered into an agreement to acquire a  working interest  net revenue interest in the je richey lease the je richey lease is located in a very prolific multiple pay area originally discovered by arco in the early ’s this lease area has six known productive formations within the immediate area this lease offers a conservative approach to building oil and gas production through reworking and re completing existing wells coupled with spacing allowable for new drilling of  or more wells the existing three wells on the lease are fully equipped with downhole pumps rods tubing pump jacks well head and surface equipment including flow lines production tanks meter connections and gas gathering pipelines of particular interest on this lease is the concho richey  well which is located due west of the olympia hale  well that has produced more than  bbls and over  mmcfg from the gray formation  the gray formation has not been opened in the concho richey well and its log characteristics are very similar to those of the olympia hale well in march  the company entered into an agreement to sell a   nri working interest in the  wells on the lease for  the funds are to be used towards the turnkey costs of placing the three wells into production in may  the company commenced reworking the j e richey    wells the following photos were taken of the work being conducted on the je richey    wells the reworking of the je richey    wells has been completed and these wells are set for production work on the third well the concho richey  is scheduled for the first week of june  upon completion of the work on the concho richey  the company will start producing these three oil and gas wells into the production tanks and gas gathering pipelines on the lease callahan county texas – shallow oil project in july  the company acquired a  working interest  net revenue interest in the isenhower lease the isenhower lease has three fully equipped wells completed in the cook sandstone at approximately  feet the lease also has one approved water injection well and eight  potential undrilled locations recent activity on the adjoining leases has renewed the interest in placing the wells back into production the offsetting leases on the north and west sides of the lease have had  new wells drilled on it within the past year to complement the existing wells on those leases this activity on the adjoining leases is part of a petroleum engineered repressuring waterflood program the target for the repressuring waterflood program is the cook sandstone which is noted to have excellent porosity and permeability our lease is poised in an excellent position to receive benefit from the repressuring of the cook sandstone by theoperator on the adjoining leases to the north and west sides of our leased acreage this repressuring may significantly improve the production rates on the lease which could have a dramatic effect on the revenues generated from the existing wells and any new wells drilled on our lease the company’s plan is to rework all three of the wells to place them back into production and drill new wells to fully develop the acreage callahan county texas – mississippi reef project in july  the company entered into an agreement to acquire a  working interest  net revenue interest in the j morgan lease the j morgan lease is located in an area with multiple formations that are known to be oil  gas productive of particular interest are the recent mississippi reef discoveries in the area a number of notable mississippi reef discoveries have been located using d seismic in this area one of these mississippi reef discoveries has produced over  barrels of oil and  mmcf of natural gas in less than  years a d seismic survey has been conducted covering the leased acreage reflecting an anomaly of interest while the mississippi reef is the primary target there are four other productive formations known to produce in the immediate area of the acreage and the possibility of three other formations that are also known to produce in the area of particular interest is the cross cut formation which was productive on the east side of the lease and could have potential on other parts of the acreage winnemucca mountain gold property the winnemucca mountain property the “property’ consists of a total  unpatented mineral claims in humboldt county in northwestern nevada humboldt county is the second largest gold producing county in the united states and hosts numerous past and producing gold mines including the getchell barricknewmont marigold goldcorp lone tree newmont and twin creeks newmont the property is located about  km northwest of the lone tree mine and  km southeast of the historic sleeper open pit mine operated by amax gold from  to  recent exploration at sleeper has identified an additional resource of over  million ounces of gold and in excess of  million ounces of silver the property is located near the northern end of the highly productive battle mountaineureka mineral trend and is underlain by triassic sediments cut by several phases of cretaceous and tertiary intrusive and volcanic rocks previous exploration on the winnemucca mountain property conducted by santa fe pacific gold corp now newmont mining between  and  focused on the pediment covered swordfish zone gold mineralization in the swordfish zone occurs within a northeast trending low sulfide quartz vein system that extends approximately  meters  feet along the western flank of claim block santa fe conducted geological mapping rock sampling trenching csamt and induced polarization geophysical surveys collected  auger hole bedrock samples and completed a total of  meters  feet in  reverse circulation rc drill holes nearly all of which were focused on the swordfish zone and reported results ranging up to  m averaging  g per tonne gold  feet averaging  opt gold near the end of santa fe’s tenure on the property a stepout hole  meters  feet to the northeast of the swordfish zone encountered  gt gold  opt gold across  meters  feet at what is known as the ‘sf extension’ this intercept was never followed up on by santa fe who relinquished their interest in the property shortly thereaftermanagement considers the untested and pediment covered meter strike between the swordfish zone and sf extension to be a high priority drill target as well as investigating other areas beyondin addition to the swordfish and sf extension areas additional exploration targets have been identified and are comprised of multiple outcropping veintype occurrences reported to carry anomalous gold values that have yet to be explored in detail exploration conducted in  which included an induced polarization ip survey is thought to have delineated two new target zones that correlate well with known mineralized areas initial exploration completed by northern minerals and exploration “northern” including geologic mapping rock sampling and geochemical exploration has shown a series of steeply dipping quartz veins outcroppings which appear to be associated with a major northeast trending goldbearing shear zone that is several hundred feet wide and  feet in length in the swordfish target area on winnemucca mountain indicating that the total strike length at the swordfish target is potentially significantly longer than the  feet previously outlined by santa fe pacific in the ’s results from the northern’s initial phase of the exploration on the winnemucca mountain property have been combined with available historic data to construct d modeling of the potential resource target area and to determine an ideal drilling strategy winnemucca mountain property summary the winnemucca mountain property covers  acres and is located in an area of numerous past and current gold mines two of the most significant are the sleeper and hycroft mines both of which produced over one million ounces of gold during operations from the late ’s to the late ’s both mines are located to the west of winnemucca mountain gold and silver were first discovered in the winnemucca mining district in  and during the ’s several smelters were constructed in the area modern exploration began in the ’s with mapping geochemical sampling geophysics and drilling conducted by several companies including st joe cordex tenneco and sante fe pacific gold by the mid’s over  feet of drilling had been completed a large percentage of this drilling was done in the swordfish target which is currently being evaluated by the company as a potentially minable deposit

pathway to production through the completion of the project’s prefeasibility study and definitive feasibility study in  and  respectively during this time northern minerals also made significant progression in respect to the project’s approvals with the signing of a coexistence agreement with the traditional owners the jaru people and granting of the project’s primary environmental approval and mining lease in  the company is working on its new business plan to bring the project into production the plan which separates the project’s development into three stages allows northern minerals to test through a pilot plant the project and market develop the project to bankable feasibility study level and then build the full scale operation   rare earths  northern minerals subscribe

tanami region of the northern territory about km south east of the browns range project it is part of a tenement package which includes most of the eastern section of the browns range dome and extends southward toward the tanami gold mine the tenements are contiguous with the browns range hre project tenements historical exploration activity at boulder ridge from the s and s has identified high grades of total rare earth oxides treo from rock chip samples the samples indicate xenotime mineralisation within quartz veins hosted by silicified and brecciated sandstone northern minerals’ first pass reconnaissance geological mapping and rock chip sampling was completed at boulder ridge in september  target areas for onground followup were identified from a review of historical exploration data plus an interpretation of the area based on airborne geophysical survey data the rock chip sampling program was not systematic over the area but was selective in nature in order to obtain an indication of mineralisation the results of the rock chip sampling included some outstanding highgrade assay results of greater than  treo they also featured a dominance of heavy rare earths hres with up to  of the total rare earth oxide treo being high value hre of the  samples collected from the prospect  had a treo grade above  including up to  dysprosium oxide with xenotime mineralisation observed in several places soil sampling further rock  chip sampling and portable xrf surveys have subsequently been completed which have confirmed the highgrade nature of the hre mineralisation in addition a highresolution airborne magnetics and radiometrics survey has been completed which has highlighted further targets for onground followup the results to date reinforce the significant exploration potential of the browns range and tanami regions which remain largely untested for xenotimehosted hre mineralisation further work will be focused on drill testing the initial targets at

produce a high purity dysprosium rich mixed re carbonate processing the ore will be processed through a beneficiation and hydrometallurgical facility collocated on site to produce a high purity dysprosium rich mixed re carbonate for export the xenotime mineralisation found at browns range is rich in dysprosium and other high value heavy rare earth oxides hreo the xenotime in combination with the mainly silica host rock allows the ore to be upgraded up to  times through the beneficiation process with excellent recoveries this recovery and upgrade ratio has resulted in a competitive preproduction capital cost estimate stage one test the pilot plant will consist of all the processing steps detailed in the project’s definitive feasibility study dfs and in stage three below however the plant will be downsized to a capacity to process tpa of ore at  total rare earth oxides treo through the beneficiation plant and tpa of xenotime concentrate at  treo through the hydrometallurgical

site construction period and allow it to be transported to undertake testwork at other projects if required stage two develop produce a premium product significant opportunity exists to reduce downstream solvent extraction sx separation costs by separating yttrium in the hydrometallurgical process removing approximately  of the yttrium results in less mixed re carbonate being produced and less material required to be processed through the downstream sx separation process with current market signals indicating that sale of the yttrium oxide is likely to be limited for the foreseeable future this step will increase the percentage of the dysprosium in the mixed re carbonate product from  dytreo to around  dytreo completion of initial testwork at ansto minerals has indicated that removal of yttrium lanthanum and cerium can be achieved through a relatively simple addition to the hydrometallurgical process any further studies will progress in line with funding stage three full scale  beneficiation plant the full scale beneficiation plant will process tpa of ore to produce a high grade mineral concentrate to feed into the hydrometallurgical plant the process consists of a crushing and grinding circuit and a combination of wet high gradient magnetic separation and flotation the overall beneficiation circuit delivers outstanding recoveries of  dysprosium and  treo at a  treo mineral concentrate grade hydrometallurgical plant the proposed hydrometallurgical plant will use conventional unit processes to treat tpa of mineral concentrate from the beneficiation plant the hydrometallurgical plant processes include sulphation bake followed by water leach purification of the leach liquor to remove deleterious elements and carbonate precipitation step to precipitate a

filtration viscosity and material handling the mineral concentrate produced during the beneficiation pilot plant was used for the hydrometallurgical bench scale and pilot plant testwork at ansto minerals in early  northern minerals and ansto conducted three five day continuous hydrometallurgical pilot plant campaigns with the final run being completed in june  the proposed flowsheet achieved a  dysprosium and an overall  treo recovery under the continuous pilot plant conditions the grade of mixed re carbonate produced typically contained  treo the hydrometallurgical pilot plant testwork achieved a number of exceptional results in particular the simple and robust acid concentrate mixing and kiln operation which displayed none of the apparent material handling issues that have been problematic for other rare earth monazite bastnaesite and apatite concentrates in addition the low concentration of the deleterious elements such as thorium and uranium in the rare earth carbonate concentrate produced makes the product suitable for downstream processing similar to the beneficiation pilot plant external contractors were engaged during the pilot plant campaigns to conduct testwork in order to gather engineering data for detailed design these were thickening filtration materials handling and waste gas treatment vendors the pilot plant in stage one will continue on from this testwork and allow northern minerals to test the process and to further derisk the development of the full scale operation by allowing it to test a number of process flowsheet variables that
