brand in every land billion dollar beverage business likes to control brands and markets we started to distribute our apple juice in little brown beer bottles through canada dry in phila in  we signed the contract in march but they wont start distribution until after july so i lost the entire spring and summer they wouldnt even take over the service of the  accounts i had selling my juice in the philadelphia area the contract they drafted gave them the product rights in ny baltimore washington and virginia but those operations didnt know anything about it and couldnt give me a decision about whether they would take it on and start selling it i eventually parted with the baltimorewashington after dick wolf told me i would be dead meat  and ny operations because they could care less they wanted to tie up the product and keep me from going elsewhere now this was about the same time snapple was getting started with their tea and we made fruit teas alsofirst told me he couldnt sell my tea because he had tetley but then took on snapple teas in  they lied about theyll being interested in snapple and then one day when i went over there to pick up some samples i found snapple everywhere  we had  oz bottles of fruit drinksfruit punch lemonade grapeade but canada dry wouldnt take that size and proceeded to killed off my lemonade by selling the  oz bottle almost for the same price as the  oz snapple lemonade in  told me my juice cocktails were not the same as snapple fruit ades but then after snapple came out with juice cocktails  juice in  told me those were different at his companies th anniversary celebration he whispered in my ear if i didnt take snapple someone else would  this way we can control it a  pound gorilla and his pointy tooth lawyer believe they can make up the rules as they go along the snapple people had already pulled snapple from my maryland distributors who sued them and won because they wanted them to drop my brand  we backed off from canada dry the first year with them selling snapple teas lemonade and fruit punch we found that the canada dry salespeople were selling snapple and not elliotts they killed off my lemonade by selling the  oz lemonade for the same as the snapple  oz instead of selling my  oz lemonade then the second year snapple came out with products labeled fruit juice cocktails  canada drys spin was these were different that elliotts juice cocktails the juice content was lower they werent the same qualityyadda yadda  we gave them an ultimatum to sell our fruit juices and fruit drinks exclusively and we eventually set up a distribution company to sell our products and other products not yet being distributed in the philadelphia area they said they were going to split the sales force with some people selling snapple and something else and another group selling elliotts and something else we have too many brands for one person to sell this never happened i put together a business plan to start up another beverage distribution plan and had a pert chart with all the details i met with his son jeffrey and while impressed told me they were not going to do thatnow  so in october  we set about to set up shop with a start up date of april  this was an operation to cover the eight county philadelphia metro area with only  trucks vs  that canada dry had and  salespeople vs  that canada dry had we seemed to have the support of imbesi the sevenup operation also located in conshohocken because they didnt like the honickman empire although they had one of their own so the enemy of my enemy is my friend and they agreed to rent up trucks before our  leased trucks were built and delivered one day while i was waiting for the phones to be installed harold and jeffrey came to visit and told me i was making a mistake becoming a competitor  in may the teamsters were stopping our drivers around the corner from the warehouse  to organize the drivers and warehouse personnel so we had a national labor relational board election and had to deal with organized labor and the dance required to treat some people different than others i dont think there was much of a out of pocket cost difference with the union drivers since we had been paying them the same as other beverage companies in retrospect i should have shifted to a independent owner operator driver sales operation but my beverage expertsall from traditional presell soda  operationsled me down the path of presell salespeople company cars next day deliveries requiring a night shift to pick orders and load trucks and brain dead supervisors with company cars who hide all day and they came back to ask salespeople how many cases they sold like we had a complete stateof theart software system they gave me that information after the orders were downloaded through modems and processed  five months into the business we discovered james waldron my national sales manager who had been the sales manager at canada dry had his own business going and we cleaned house and retrenched although at the bottling plant was closed by the bankruptcy trustee and i had that problem to deal with at the same time canada dry replaced my brand with a knock off of my product line country pure  which i stumbled across while attending a novell seminar in center city  and convinced he other canada dry buddies to drop my brand then motts came out with juices and he dropped country pure country pure resurrects its ugly face in january  and guess who is going to distribute it at low predatory pricing you got it during year two when we started to distribute franks soda which had been in philadelphia for over 0 years he told super fresh a large supermarket chain they didnt need another generic soda since they already have their own brand which he bottles for them of course he now owns the franks brand which has been beaten up to a pulp by days soda but at least no one else could sell franks under pressure from corestates we reluctantly sold our distribution company to bei in  at the same time canada dry started distributing nantucket nectars bei  was abandoning the  up and down the street accounts we had and focusing on supermarkets after acquiring imbesi  up a year later  waldron  was working for for everfresh and was busy setting up a distributor network at the same time as revenge bei finally folded and the company that had started hanks root beer  had sold their rights to nantucket nectars to canada dry the same company had arizona tea and this brand went to bei and then to canada dry although they had snapple mistic and tetley tea so lm who owned hanks got out of the distribution business and left me high and dry without any distribution in philadelphia lm also owned the rights to a hot beer yuengling and guess who they sold those rights to you got it origlio who is the coors distributor owned by honickman in  we were also bottling our juices at beverage capital a plant owned by honickman as well as two other plants we decided to fund a new dedicated hot fill bottling line at the maryland plant and had a contract to bottle lipton tea which honickman as the pepsi distributor was going to distribute in new jersey and new york city  when the plant was experiencing trouble instead of offering to help his buddies at pepsi get lipton up and running he convinced lipton to pull out of the new plant to go down the road to his bottling plant in baltimore without this key piece of business and the revenue there was no future for the bottling plant and no way they would be able to reorganize it was the major reason why the plant was closed by the bankruptcy trustee hoovers on line heres an interesting law suit filed against honickman and heres how honickman got aw root beer in new york heres how honickman got the rights to up in brooklyn queens and westchester united states court of appeals   for the second circuit no   august term   argued february   decided may   docket nos 6  harold screws over the  independent canada dry distributors in nyc plaintiffsappellants are independent distributors of soft drink products bottled andor distributed by defendantappellee canada dry bottling company of new york inc canada dry  on november   they sued canada dry and others in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging inter alia that canada dry had conspired to restrain the trade of soft drink products in violation of the sherman act the clayton act the tafthartley act and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act ftcs own report on the soft drink industry  recently made the forbes list of the  richest people in america my advice always marry a rich girl and have her dad buy you a company harold honickman owns the pepsi franchise  in nyc and  half of new jersey hed like to buy pepsi philadelphia but those ftc lawyers wouldnt like thathed have to sell off canada dry but cadbury is also buying out their independent distributors in some markets and honickman owns those brands from ny though virginia if he sold everything his son  jeffrey baron of bubbles wouldnt have anything to do except count all the family money   nominated in  to the beverage hall of fame harold is disappointed hes not the only one and offers money to have it renamed the honickman beverage hall of fame youd think hes a warm compassionate human being now that hes donating money to various institutions for naming rights you cant take it with you and you might as well be remembered for something besides being a monopolistic megalomaniac   if i give you money will you name the moon after me after all it doesnt have a name yet   if i give you some money can you put my statute on top of city hall instead of william penn hark  harold must have gotten another beverage brand   hey stop picking on harold just because were monopolists doesnt mean we dont have a heart we just keep it in a jar by the side of our bed
