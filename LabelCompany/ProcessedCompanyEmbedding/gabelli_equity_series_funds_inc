pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when the equity income funds shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the equity income funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the equity income funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies the equity income fund will seek to achieve its investment objective through a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing under normal market conditions at least  of its net assets in income producing equity securities income producing equity securities include for example common stock preferred stock and convertible securities in making stock selections gabelli funds llc the equity income funds adviser the adviser looks for securities that have a better yield than the average of the standard and poors  index the sp  index as well as capital gains potential in selecting investments for the equity income fund the adviser focuses on issuers that        have strong free cash flow and pay regular dividends      have potential for long term earnings per share growth      may be subject to a value catalyst such as industry developments regulatory changes changes in management sale or spinoff of a division or the development of a profitable new business      are well managed      will benefit from sustainable long term economic dynamics such as globalization of an issuers industry or an issuers increased focus on productivity or enhancement of services the adviser also believes preferred stock and convertible securities of selected companies offer opportunities for capital appreciation as well as periodic income and may invest a portion of the equity income funds assets in such securities this is particularly true in the case of companies that have performed below expectations if a companys performance has been poor enough its preferred stock and convertible debt securities will trade more like common stock than like a fixed income security and may result in above average appreciation if performance improves even if the credit quality of the company is not in question the market price of the convertible security will reflect little or no element of conversion value if the price of its common stock has fallen substantially below the conversion price this leads to the possibility of capital appreciation if the price of the common stock recovers            principal risks you may want to invest in the equity income fund if        you are a long term investor      you are seeking income as well as capital appreciation the equity income funds share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the equity income funds portfolio securities your investment in the equity income fund is not guaranteed you may lose money by investing in the equity income fund when you sell equity income fund shares they may be worth more or less than what you paid for them investing in the equity income fund involves the following risks        equity risk     equity risk is the risk that the prices of the securities held by the equity income fund will change due to general market and economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the companies issuing the securities participate and the issuer companys particular circumstances dividends on common equity securities are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of an issuers board of directors companies that have historically paid dividends on their securities are not required to continue to pay dividends on such securities there is no guarantee that the issuers of the common equity securities will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will remain at current levels or increase over time therefore there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future the equity income funds investments in dividend producing equity securities may also limit its potential for appreciation during a broad market advance the prices of dividend producing equity securities can be highly volatile investors should not assume that the equity income funds investments in these securities will necessarily reduce the volatility of the equity income funds nav or provide protection compared to other types of equity securities when markets perform poorly        foreign securities risk     investments in foreign securities involve risks relating to political social and economic developments abroad as well as risks resulting from the differences between the regulations to which us and foreign issuers and markets are subject these risks include expropriation differing accounting and disclosure standards currency exchange risks settlement difficulties market illiquidity difficulties enforcing legal rights and greater transaction costs these risks are more pronounced in the securities of companies located in emerging markets        interest rate risk and credit risk     investments in preferred stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred stock involve interest rate risk and credit risk when interest rates decline the value of such securities generally rises conversely when interest rates rise the value of such securities generally declines this risk is particularly pronounced given that certain interest rates are at or near historical lows it is also possible that the issuer of a security will not be able to make dividend interest and principal payments when due        low credit quality risk     lower rated convertible securities are subject to greater credit risk greater price volatility and a greater risk of loss than investment grade securities there may be less of a market for lower rated convertible securities which could make it harder to sell them at an acceptable price lower rated securities are commonly referred to as junk or high yield securities        management risk     if the portfolio manager is incorrect in his assessment of the growth prospects of the securities the equity income fund holds then the value of the equity income funds shares may decline        value investing risk     the equity income fund invests in value stocks the portfolio manager may be wrong in the assessment of a companys value and the stocks the equity income fund holds may not reach what the portfolio manager believes are their full values from time to time value investing falls out of favor with investors during those periods the equity income funds relative performance may suffer            performance the bar chart and table that follow provide an indication of the risks of investing in the equity income fund by showing changes in the equity income funds performance from year to year and by showing how the equity income funds average annual

washington dc      re the gabelli equity income fund a series of gabelli      equity series funds inc file no       request for relief pursuant to rule be ladies and gentlemen pursuant to rule be under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” gabelli equity series funds inc the “company” on behalf of the gabelli equity income fund a series of the company the “fund” because of unforeseen circumstances hereby requests authorization to make distributions with respect to its taxable year ended september   the “ taxable year” that otherwise would be prohibited by rule b promulgated under the  act specifically to characterize and report to shareholders as capital gain dividends the portion of certain monthly distributions the fund has paid to its shareholders during the  taxable year that exceeds its net income and short term gains “net investment income” for that year the “excess distributions” and to make one or more additional capital gain distributions with respect to the  taxable year for federal income and excise tax purposes the excess distributions amount to approximately  million which is substantially more than the amount of any one of the fund’s monthly distributions therefore in order to treat the excess distributions as capital gain distributions the fund proposes to characterize portions of its january february march april may june and july  distributions and all of its august  distribution as capital gain distributions characterizing those whole and partial distributions as capital gain distributions paying an additional capital gain distribution in september  and potentially paying one or more additional capital gain distributions prior to us securities and exchange commission september   page    december   for federal income and excise tax purposes if deemed necessary or appropriate by the company’s board of directors or the company’s officers acting pursuant to authority delegated by the company’s board of directors would result in the fund making a number of capital gain distributions with respect to the  taxable year in excess of that which otherwise would be permitted under rule ba and f however characterizing portions of its january february march april may june and july  distributions and all of its august  distribution as capital gain distributions would enable the fund to avoid adverse federal income tax results to the fund and its shareholders arising from unforeseen circumstances which include either causing the fund and its shareholders to pay more income tax than necessary or forcing the fund to make larger than commercially desirable returns of capital as discussed in greater detail below either of these choices could have unnecessary and potentially adverse impacts on the fund’s shareholders and also have the potential to confuse or mislead shareholders background of the fund the fund is a series of the company the company was incorporated on july   in maryland the fund is a diversified openend management investment company registered under the  act and one of three separately managed portfolios of the company the fund seeks to provide a high level of total return on its assets with an emphasis on income the fund commenced investment operations on january   the fund’s fiscal and tax year end is september  gabelli funds llc is the fund’s investment adviser the fund has a fixed distribution policy under the policy the fund declares and pays monthly distributions from net investment income capital gains and paidin capital the company’s board of directors continually evaluates the fund’s distribution policy in light of ongoing economic and market conditions and may change the amount of the fund’s monthly distributions during the  taxable year the fund’s monthly distribution has been fixed at  per share the fund has had a fixed monthly distribution policy since april  in the fund’s many years of experience with a fixed distribution policy the fund has never until this year encountered any problem with complying with rule b legal analysis and request for relief section b of the  act provides that it shall be unlawful in contravention of such rules regulations or orders as the us securities and exchange commission the “commission” may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors for any registered investment company to distribute longterm capital gains more often than once every   us securities and exchange commission september   page    twelve months rule b under the  act provides in essence that no registered investment company which is a “regulated investment company” a “ric” as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” shall distribute more than one “capital gain dividend” as defined in section bc of the code “primary distribution” with respect to any one taxable year of the company other than i one additional capital gain dividend made in whole or in part to avoid excise tax under section  of the code pursuant to rule bf under the  act “excise tax avoidance distribution” ii one supplemental capital gain dividend pursuant to section  of the code not in excess of  of the total amount distributed for that year pursuant to rule ba under the  act and iii one or more additional distributions made pursuant to requests granted under rule be under the  act the legislative history of section b of the  act and the administrative history of rule b promulgated thereunder indicate that the limits placed on capital gains distributions were intended to prevent investors from confusing these distributions with income distributions and to prevent certain abusive practices one such practice discussed in a commission report to congress was where an investment company sold portfolio securities primarily to realize a predetermined amount of gain without consideration of whether the growth potential of the investment had been fully realized or whether the sale was consistent with the stated investment objectives of the company further the report indicated that dealers had on occasion relied on capital gains distributions to make an investment company seem more attractive to investors by encouraging the purchase of such company’s shares in anticipation of these distributions without disclosing all the facts relating to such purchases the report also reflected concern that frequent distributions of longterm capital gains would increase administrative expenses       see distribution of longterm capital gains by registered investment companies  act rel no  jun   citing s rep no  st cong st sess   “public policy implications of investment company growth” report of the securities and exchange commission hr rep no  th cong d sess   “policy implications report”   id citing policy implications report at    id at n “for example since the purchase price of the shares would reflect the expected dividend distribution an investor who bought before the record date would i lose the portion of sales load attributable to the distribution and ii pay taxes on the distribution even though it constituted an immediate partial refund of the money just invested these facts were often not disclosed to the investor”   id citing policy implications report at   act rel no  oct     us securities and exchange commission september   page    the fund’s proposal is entirely consistent with the policy goals of avoiding these types of abuses the fund’s policy of paying a fixed monthly distribution is longstanding and has not been manipulated in an effort to realize gains and “sell the dividend” quite to the contrary over the course of the  taxable year the fund has not suggested that shareholders are receiving or should expect to receive large capital gain distributions at all a request may be made under rule be if a registered investment company because of unforeseen circumstances in a particular taxable year proposes to make a distribution which would be prohibited by the provisions of rule b the request must “set forth the pertinent facts and explain the circumstances which the company believes justify such distribution” the fund is a ric and has accumulated a large unrealized appreciation position resulting from several years of strong portfolio performance and this large unrealized appreciation position has combined with an unforeseen level of net redemptions to create an unexpected circumstance that forced the fund to sell portfolio securities and realize much more capital gain than anticipated the fund’s strong portfolio performance over the course of the past several years has resulted in the fund’s net unrealized appreciation more than doubling from  as of september   to  as of march   in particular as of march   the fund’s net unrealized appreciation was comprised of  in gross unrealized appreciation and only  in gross unrealized depreciation thus in order to fund the substantial and unforeseen net redemptions described below the fund has been forced to sell appreciated portfolio securities and realize a substantial amount of net longterm capital gains which currently amounts to approximately  million as such amount may be increased by additional realizations of net longterm capital gains with respect to the  taxable year the “realized ltcg” the fund has also experienced substantial net redemptions over the course of the  taxable year these net redemptions through august   have amounted to approximately  of the fund’s net assets as of september   and have reduced its net assets from approximately  billion to approximately  billion these redemptions spiked during the fund’s second fiscal quarter continued at an elevated level during the fund’s third fiscal quarter and have continued through the fund’s fourth fiscal quarter which is ongoing during the       the fund notes that it distributed in december  approximately  million of longterm capital gain realized in october  to avoid excise tax under section  of the code with respect to the fund’s  taxable year   us securities and exchange commission september   page    fund’s first fiscal quarter net redemptions amounted to approximately  million before more than doubling to approximately  million in the fund’s second fiscal quarter and continuing at a level of approximately  million in the fund’s third fiscal quarter as of august   net redemptions amounted to approximately  million normally such large redemptions would be expected to be accompanied by poor absolute performance thus the fund would not have expected such large redemptions without having larger unrealized depreciation the fund’s experience with net redemptions during the  taxable year has deviated substantially from the fund’s recent subscription excluding dividend reinvestments and redemption activity in the fund’s fiscal years ended september    and  the fund had net subscriptionsredemptions of approximately  million  million and  million respectively additionally for every fiscal year from  through  the fund had net subscriptions ranging from approximately  million to approximately  million as noted above through august   the fund’s net redemptions during the  taxable year are approximately  million which is more than three times the fund’s highest amount of net redemptions since  and more than all net redemptions since the fund’s fiscal year ended september   the fund believes that its net redemption activity during its first fiscal quarter was not out of the ordinary and at that time the fund believed that it would be able to manage gains by taking losses in securities the fund would be interested in selling the fund’s redemption activity however accelerated in an unforeseen manner in the fund’s second fiscal quarter and the unforeseen continuation of redemptions throughout the remainder of the  taxable year together with the fund’s very low level of unrealized depreciation has forced the fund to realize more longterm capital gains than anticipated at a later point in the fund’s fiscal year than anticipated these unforeseen circumstances have left the fund with options that in the absence of the requested relief would result in undesirable consequences for the fund’s shareholders as of august   the fund had distributed approximately  million with respect to the  taxable year approximately  million of these distributions represent net investment income and absent relief approximately  million of these distributions would need to be characterized as returns of capital and the fund would need to use the primary distribution and the excise tax avoidance distribution to distribute the fund’s realized ltcgs which currently amount to approximately  million       all references to net redemptions in this application exclude the effect of shares issued as a result of dividend reinvestments   all of the numbers in this application relating to amounts distributed the characterization thereof net capital gains and the amount of distributions that would be needed to eliminate the fund’s federal income and excise tax liability on net capital gains are estimates and ignore for simplicity’s sake the potential effect of “equalization” in respect of redemptions and the distribution of longterm capital gain realized in october  to avoid excise tax under section  of the code with respect to the fund’s  taxable year see supra note    us securities and exchange commission september   page    absent relief the most likely course of action for the fund to remain in compliance with rule b and to not be subject to federal income tax on retained net capital gains would be because the code generally requires return of capital to be deemed distributed ratably over all distributions for the year to distribute in addition to the distributions of approximately  million already made with respect to the  taxable year much more than the realized ltcgs realized as a result of ordinary investment activity and to fund net redemptions this would result in the fund being treated as having made a large and unnecessary return of capital distribution for the  taxable year well in excess of the excess distributions in excess of  million based on currently available information this result which would arise solely because of rule b would have at least three undesirable consequences for fund shareholders      in order to fund these required distributions the fund would need to raise an additional amount of cash at least equal to and likely in       to demonstrate the effect of this rule ignoring a special tax rule for noncalendaryear rics which would allocate as much “earnings  profits” as possible to any distributions that were made prejan   which could further exacerbate the situation if for example the fund were to have “earnings  profits” for its  fiscal year of  million net capital gains of  million ordinary investment company income of  million and has made  million of distributions thus far for the year then to be treated as having distributed  of the net capital gain for  the fund would need to declare a further distribution in september of  million ie      the other next likely alternative is also highly unattractive if for its  taxable year the fund distributed merely its remaining earnings and profits currently amounting to approximately  million and reported all of that to the shareholders as capital gains all of the remaining distributions for the year would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income and the fund would have to pay income tax as a corporation on the amount equal to the excess distributions ie the net capital gains that would be treated under the code as undistributed given that the maximum federal rate to individual shareholders on ordinary income dividends is  as opposed to the  rate on capital gains dividends and that the fund’s federal income tax rate on retained net capital gain is  the degree to which this result would be undesirable and unpopular is very clear moreover there would also likely be additional adverse state and in some cases local income tax consequences to the fund and its shareholders   us securities and exchange commission september   page      excess of the excess distributions this would only serve to exacerbate the fund’s existing unfortunate situation by likely causing the fund due to its large unrealized appreciation position to realize yet additional longterm capital gains that would have to be distributed in order to avoid incurring federal income tax on retained net capital gains this would also likely exacerbate the adverse effect of the code’s treatment of returns of capital described in note  the fund believes that it would not be in the best interests of shareholders to be forced to sell portfolio securities incur transaction expenses and exacerbate these adverse effects particularly in view of the fact that the cash raised to fund these distributions would be for book and economic purposes returns of capital and are only necessary as a result of the application of rule b      many of the fund’s shareholders participate in the fund’s dividend reinvestment program either directly or through a broker it makes little sense from a shareholder’s perspective to be distributed excess cash that would simply be reinvested in the fund particularly when the only reason for such a distribution to occur is the interaction of the requirements of rule b with the unexpected circumstances described above moreover from a reinvesting shareholder’s perspective receiving excessive returns of capital complicates his or her tax accounting because the reduction in basis due to the return of capital has to be recorded and then the increase in basis resulting from the reinvestment has to be further tracked on the whole such a shareholder would rather have to make no basis adjustment than be forced to make a negative one followed by an offsetting positive one      making such a large return of capital distribution in the context of the fund’s large gain position and fixed distribution policy would be potentially confusing and misleading to shareholders shareholders expect a  per month distribution from the fund and to the extent shareholders receive in excess of that amount shareholders are likely to assume the excess results from capital gains distributions that the fund would make to avoid incurring federal income and excise taxes here if the fund were forced to distribute the realized ltcgs without offsetting the excess distributions shareholders could be confused as to why the fund returned a large amount of capital given its large gain position and could be misled about the nature of the       see supra note    us securities and exchange commission september   page      distribution comprising the realized ltcgs since at least nearly half of it ie the amount equal to the excess distributions would economically be a return of capital for shareholders this effect – returning capital when shareholders would expect gain – would produce exactly the type of confusion that rule b was designed to avoid the fund therefore believes that the more appropriate course of action in view of these unforeseen circumstances is to characterize and to report for income tax purposes the excess distributions as longterm capital gain distributions rather than as ordinary income or as returns of capital and to utilize one or more additional longterm capital gain distributions to distribute an amount equal to the realized ltcgs less the excess distributions which currently would amount to approximately  million justification for the requested relief the fund believes that the relief sought herein is consistent with the intent and purpose of section  of the  act and rule b thereunder there should be no significant administrative costs associated with the recharacterization of the excess distributions additionally as reflected above none of the abuses underlying the enactment of section b and the adoption of rule b are present here the fund has not realized the gains at issue here to “sell its dividend” and over the course of the  taxable year the fund has not suggested that shareholders are receiving large capital gain distributions at all the fund’s monthly distribution amounts have remained fixed and no effort has been made to increase the fund’s regular distributions through the realization of capital gains that could confuse shareholders and increase the fund’s yield in an unsustainable manner moreover as described above the economic return of capital that would result absent relief would produce exactly the type of confusion that rule b was designed to avoid the fund also notes that the requested relief does not implicate another principal concern leading to the enactment of section b and the adoption of rule b that concern was that shareholders might be unable to distinguish between frequent distributions of capital gains and dividends from investment income in the instant situation however there is little or no risk of any such confusion the recharacterized excess distributions as well as the distributions comprising the realized ltcgs for the  taxable year will be fully described to shareholders as required by rule a under the  act a statement showing the anticipated source or sources of the distribution would accompany the realized ltcg distribution or the confirmation of the reinvestment thereof under the fund’s   us securities and exchange commission september   page    dividend reinvestment plan and did if applicable accompany the fund’s  taxable year distributions already made or the confirmation of the reinvestment thereof under the fund’s dividend reinvestment plan such statements accompanying the fund’s  taxable year distributions already made indicated the portion of the distribution that was not anticipated to come from net investment income in addition each fund shareholder who is subject to us federal income taxation and who received distributions from the fund including shareholders who have sold shares during the year will receive a form div report that identifies the amount and character ie tax exempt dividend ordinary dividend “qualified dividend” capital gain dividend or “nontaxable distribution” that is return of capital of each distribution made by the fund to the shareholder during the calendar year  accordingly the fund believes that its shareholders will be provided sufficient information to understand the source of the fund’s distributions for its  taxable year and that these distributions did not or will not wholly represent dividend yield or return on investment rule be provides that if a registered investment company because of unforeseen circumstances in a particular taxable year proposes to make a distribution which would be prohibited by the provisions of rule b it may file a request with the commission for authorization to make such a distribution the fund submits that the combination of its i large gross unrealized appreciation position relative to its small gross unrealized depreciation position in the  taxable year ii unexpected and accelerating net redemptions over the course of the  taxable year and iii resulting need to sell appreciated portfolio securities to raise cash to fund these unexpected redemptions and in so doing realizing longterm capital gains in a larger amount and at a later point in its fiscal year than anticipated are among the types of “unforeseen circumstances” contemplated by rule be  the fund understands that pursuant to rule be this request will be deemed granted unless within  days after the date hereof the request is denied by the commission all actions necessary to authorize the execution and filing of this request under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company have been taken and the person signing and filing this request is authorized to do so on behalf of the company the verification
