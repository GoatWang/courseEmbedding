exchange rate changes operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended  increased  or  to  from  for the year ended  the increase resulted primarily due to increases in commissions and additional support staff expenses added during the second half of  general and administrative expenses for the year ended  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended  the expense decrease is

deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company had a deferred tax asset resulting from accumulated net operating losses but they had been fully reserved as of december   because the company concluded that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized at december   and again at january   the company concluded after an analysis at each period that it was now more likely than not that some of the asset would be realized and accordingly reduced the valuation allowance by  and  for the years ended january   and december

base lending rate which was  at january   at january   the lines provided an additional availability of approximately  million we plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs for fiscal  and future periods the balances due under the lines of credit are recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet given our capital resources in the us and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions we do not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash accordingly we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for these unremitted earnings in the event that circumstances should change in the future and we decide to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund us operations the company would record a tax expense and pay the applicable us taxes on these repatriated foreign amounts the ratio of current assets to current liabilities including the amount due under our lines of credit was  at january   and  at december   cash balances increased  after the negative effects of currency translation of  to  at january   from  at december   of the above noted amounts  and  were held outside the us by our foreign subsidiaries as of january   and december   respectively cash provided by operations was  for the year ended  compared to  for the year ended  cash provided by operations during  was primarily due to

of this report we currently have several ongoing capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our manufacturing plants we will use a combination of financing arrangements to provide the necessary capital we believe that our existing resources including cash on

agreements critical accounting policies judgments and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and operating results and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances our critical accounting policies are described below table of contents revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized from product sale upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in accordance with the agreed upon customer terms when title and risk of ownership have passed the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured based on historical results and analysis we estimate and calculate provisions for customer rebates and sales returns and allowances and record as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized accounts receivable on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounts receivable based on individual customer circumstances historical writeoffs and collections and current industry and customer credit conditions and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly our policy regarding writeoffs and collection efforts varies based on individual customer circumstances past due accounts receivable are determined based on individual customer credit terms inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout fifo method or market we assess the recoverability of inventory and record a provision for obsolescence based upon specifically identified discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted usage and sales levels these assessments which require managements judgments and estimates reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets longlived assets consist of goodwill identifiable intangible assets trademarks and property and equipment we have deemed that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized unless we determine their useful lives are no longer indefinite other intangible assets and property and equipment excluding goodwill are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful life we review longlived assets including property equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable an impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset income tax we file income tax returns in the united states as a ccorporation and in several state jurisdictions and in the united kingdom our subsidiary uniroyal is a limited liability company llc for federal and state income tax purposes and as such its income losses and credits are allocated to its members prior to november   as the previous owners the sellers were the sole members and reported the allocations on their personal tax returns as a result in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended december   there is no tax provision on its income prior to november   after this date uniroyals income is allocated entirely to ueph as its sole member the company then receives this income allocation as the sole member of ueph less the dividends paid on the preferred units held by the former members of uniroyal we follow asc  income taxes for recording the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change we have a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately  million as of january   which expires in years beginning  through  we have deferred tax assets as a result of these loss carryforwards which have been reduced by a valuation allowances to  and  at january   and december   respectively table of contents foreign currency translation the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the year the resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are excluded from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment fair value of financial instruments our shortterm financial instruments consist primarily of the following cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable we adjust the carrying value of financial assets denominated in other currencies such as cash accounts receivable accounts payable and the lines of credit using the appropriate exchange rates at the balance sheet date we believe that the carrying values of these shortterm financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values the fair value of our longterm debt is estimated based on current rates for similar instruments with the same remaining maturities in determining the current interest rates for similar instruments we take into account its risk of nonperformance we believe that the carrying value of our longterm debt approximates its estimated fair value postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees active or retired who were employed prior to february   in calculating our plan obligations and related expense we make various assumptions and estimates these assumptions include discount rates mortality rates retirement rates termination rates and other factors while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense
