insights   following the invention of the weis wave wyckoff wizzard david weis now developed new highodds trade setups and for the first time david is to reveal these highodds trade setups to public in this webinar hosted by tradingpsychologyedge david’s new trade setups are an intraday trading strategy called “springs  upthrusts in motion” david teams up with dr gary to introduce these new trade setups and dr gary will present specific tactics and trade setups to enter an unfolding trend change in its early stages new trade setups david’s excellent new springs  upthrusts in motion strategy allows you to trade close to a turning point where the risk is minimal precise rules are employed for determining if a spring or upthrust meets the prescribed form on an average day one can easily survey  or  active stocks or futures contracts and find these setups  you don’t have to trade anything else david has disclosed this strategy to his mentoring students and most of them have used it successfully one student for example has achieved a  success rate with a rigid plan for taking shortterm profits another student created a scan based on this technique small and large traders former floor traders and a fund manager have benefited from what you will be shown the weis wave software is not needed to find the trades in motion it works with great pure simplicity david’s springs  upthrusts in motion is a new concept with specifics different from the normal spring or upthrust  it is appropriate for both day trading and swing trading early trend change trade setups dr gary will show you how to enter a potential trend change early  he will detail all the signs we look for in identifying a trend making a change into a new trend and show you three complete trade setups with all the details you need to trade them confidently  keep in mind we don’t use indicators so the background conditions price behavior and volume will be explained clearly and in detail  these trade setups work well for both buying and selling the market dr gary will show traders how to enter a potential trend change aggressively and how to tell and what to do if it isn’t working out as anticipated  for more conservative traders dr gary will show trade setup and entry techniques which still put you in a trend change early but a little later in the trend change process at lesser risk  aggressive traders who have entered early can use this more conservative entry as a place to add to and pyramid their trade for greater profits buy now date wednesday november   time  pm eastern standard time
