cells have a conversion efficiency of  and each panel produces up to  w typical conventional panels produce up to  to  w silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front there is an inherent paradox in the wiring design larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation the wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success the circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell the maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell but changes the electrical connections the silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material similar to the materials used in lcd televisions and similar devices these electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance while eliminating light blockage the back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time on june   the company announced that it has produced a fullscale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of  percent a world record confirmed by the us department of energys national renewable energy lab nrel after the cells are constructed conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of  columns of  cells  other arrangements are used but rare outside commercial settings as they are placed wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back a small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells the layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances when the glue dries the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet adding a junction box for electrical connections and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness different assembly systems may use different steps but the end result is a glass sheet on top cells and wiring in the middle and the backsheet on the back the companys panels are similar in concept and layout but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells its panels use a robust edgeconnector that includes a builtin strain relief to reduce mechanical stress according to the company these changes eliminate  of the failures in conventional designs which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks only  of failures are due to cell or component failures the downside to these design changes is cost both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels however the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power systems total cost and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total in this case using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size these are both true in the case of residential installs where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system simply replacing conventional panels with sunpower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as  without having any effect on install times in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels development in stock exchangeedit the

conventional panels produce up to  to  w silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front there is an inherent paradox in the wiring design larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation the wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success the circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell the maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell but changes the electrical connections the silver wiring on the front is eliminated and replaced by a transparent electrode material similar to the materials used in lcd televisions and similar devices these electrodes have poorer electrical characteristics than silver but by covering the entire face of the cell they improve overall performance while eliminating light blockage the back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time on june   the company announced that it has produced a fullscale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of  percent a world record confirmed by the us department of energys national renewable energy lab nrel after the cells are constructed conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of  columns of  cells  other arrangements are used but rare outside commercial settings as they are placed wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back a small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells the layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances when the glue dries the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet adding a junction box for electrical connections and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness different assembly systems may use different steps but the end result is a glass sheet on top cells and wiring in the middle and the backsheet on the back the companys panels are similar in concept and layout but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells its panels use a robust edgeconnector that includes a builtin strain relief to reduce mechanical stress according to the company these changes eliminate  of the failures in conventional designs which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks only  of failures are due to cell or component failures the downside to these design changes is cost both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and drive up the price of the panels however the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power systems total cost and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total in this case using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size these are both true in the case of residential installs where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system simply replacing conventional panels with sunpower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as  without having any effect on install times in which case the total
