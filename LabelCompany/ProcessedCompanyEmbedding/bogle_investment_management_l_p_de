liner companies that operate regularly scheduled routes between large commercial ports it also provides a range of shipping services such as technical support and maintenance insurance consulting financial and accounting services costamare inc is headquartered in athens greece    wells fargo  company analysts commented we are upgrading cmre to outperform from market perform as we believe its riskreward profile is skewed to the positive with cmre well positioned for valuation uplift from the container market trough in our view cmre is off  vs the sp  up  over the past  months as the stock has faced significant downward pressure from liquidity risk rechartering risk counterparty risk a dividend cut and a soft rechartering outlook amid the containership trough given that significant equity downside to x nav we believe cmre is an attractive container recovery play while we also believe the severity of its headwinds should gradually ease over time with cmre making a number of recent moves to reposition its intermediateterm liquidity and stabilize its balance sheet while we remain broadly cautious around global containerized trade we think street expectations have generally fallen to match that outlook with the riskreward associated with a bottoming outlook potentially skewed to the upside at least longerterm we effectively think cmre has most of its bad news priced into it at this point and while continued pressure within its peer group or a more substantive outline for a border tax regime still linger as potential headwinds particularly the latter we think the longerterm recover potential outweighs them and we reiterate our outperform rating with a valuation range of share  who are some of costamares key competitors some companies that are related to
