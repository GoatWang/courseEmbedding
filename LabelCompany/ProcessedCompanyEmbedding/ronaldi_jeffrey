additional disclosures regarding this nongaap financial measure and reconciliations of net loss to adjusted ebitda now id like to turn the phone call over to phil jones chief financial officer of document security systems phil philip jones thank you jody today we announced our first quarter  financial results which are summarized in the press release we published after market close today and details in the form q filed with the sec today as well as highlighted in our earnings press release the first quarter was a very strong quarter for dss as demonstrated by revenue growth and a strong adjusted ebitda profit during the first quarter of  the company generated adjusted ebitda profit of  which was  of sales for our printed products group which produced  of adjusted ebitda profit or nearly  of sales the first quarter was a clear indication of the strength of that business and its continued success in benefiting from cushioned to higher value product areas in addition our technology management group saw significantly reduced losses as it benefits from reduced legal and professional fees along with increasingly significant authentiguard sales consolidated revenue for the third quarter was  up  from the first quarter of  during the quarter sales of packaging and printing services increased  this was driven by increasing shipments to its largest customer and sales of plastics card products increased  which benefited from an increase in revenue from its event bad business technology sale services and licensing revenue increased  as an increase in authentiguard sales was offset by a decline in it services and hardware sales as compared to the first quarter of  while revenue increased  cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation increased only  which resulted in an increase in the net margin of these two items by  this core margin improvement reflects the increasing impact of higher margin product sales increase and it’s the driver of the companys significantly improved first quarter results selling general and administrative costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization declined  in the first quarter of  primarily driven by decreases in professional fee costs which more than offset an increase in stockbased compensation costs other cost categories were generally flat except for marketing costs which increased as the company has increased its tradeshow attendance and added a marketing consultant in the first quarter of  the company posted a net loss of  thus while adjusted ebitda results were strongly in the positive our net loss results are still impacted by noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation which was especially the case for the first quarter of this year but the impact of these items on our net results is expected to decrease for the remainder of  in conclusion the first quarter was a very good quarter for the company based on several metrics we believe as a great way to begin  with that ill now turn the call to our ceo jeff ronaldi jeffrey ronaldi thank you phil i would like to thank everyone again for joining us on the call today our continued momentum relating to first quarter  revenue growth has been driven by a number of key factors and were excited about the development taking place in each of our companys core and ip divisions our printed products group continue to perform very well in the first quarter of  but continued strength in its sales of packaging id cards and security printing with respect to our digital group performance we continue to build strong monthly revenue momentum with our authentiguard technology and solutions and are working hard to open additional doors for the sale of our technologies through expansion our marketing efforts in the us and abroad we continue to enhance our domestic sales staff and marketing efforts in the us and have also recently established a business presence in asia with

year  financial results which are summarized in the press release we published after market close today and details in the form k filed with the sec today as well as highlighted in our earnings press release the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter for dss especially by the measurement of adjusted ebitda which i will go through in further detail in a bit this is the third and largest straight quarter that the company has posted positive adjusted ebitda results adjusted ebitda has been an important measurement of core profitability of our operations and as a metric management uses to evaluate and measure our performance during the fourth quarter of  the company generated a strong adjusted ebitda profit of approximately  which approximates  of sales significantly bolstering this figure was the impact of revenues from the new authentiguard client that we began to service in the fourth quarter this shows the meaningful impact that success from our authentiguard and related technology based products will have on our financials so im very pleased that the time effort and resources we have invested in our technology based product research and development is beginning to be realized revenue for the third quarter was  million up  from the fourth quarter of  yeartodate revenue ended up  to  million an increase of approximately  million for the year for the year sales of packaging and printing services increased  sales of plastic card products increased  and licensing revenue which includes authentiguard sales increased  the only revenue category which declined was our it services and hardware sales which fell  during the year as our digital group now focuses primarily on the authentiguard product line one particular area of growth is our plastic id card sales of technology based cards which were  higher in  compared to  these are high value card in projects that require specialized product knowledge technology and skills that the team at dss plastics is uniquely qualified to deliver in all our revenue from  showed a consistent positive trend of growth that is more and more weighted towards our higher value technology based products cost and expenses for the fourth quarter of  decreased by  from the fourth quarter of  and decreased  for all of  the decreases are primarily due to the reduction in impairment charges incurred in  but not in  even so absent the  impairment charges cost and expenses in the fourth quarter of  decreased approximately  from the adjusted  fourth quarter and costs and expenses decreased approximately  for the full year of  as compared to the  amounts during the fourth quarter of  direct cost of goods sold actually decreased  despite the  increase in sales as well for the for the full year direct cost of goods sold only increased  while revenue increased  these results reinforce our ability to generate a larger percentage of our revenues from our higher margin technology based offerings in addition the company saw decreases during  in nearly every expense category with the most significant being a  decrease in professional fees and a  decrease in stock based compensation costs professional fee decreases have been driven by reductions in legal costs due to the variations in the timing and stages of the companys various ip litigation matters for the fourth quarter of  the company posted net income of  and for the year the company has posted a net loss of  both were significant improvements from the  corresponding periods with the primary factor being the absent of impairment charges however even taking out these impairment charges the companys net income results have significantly improved during the year the improvement is better highlighted in the improvement of adjusted ebitda results as i discussed earlier we believe adjusted ebitda in a good measure of the companys core financial performance especially when broken out by segment adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock based compensation and other nonrecurring items including intangible asset impairment charges adjusted ebitda results for the fourth quarter and for the full year of  clearly displayed a significant improvement in results by the company from the comparable  periods the strong adjusted ebitda performance for the fourth quarter of  is the third straight quarter of positive adjusted ebitda performance that we view as the new base of expectations for this business driving these results has been first and foremost the adjusted ebitda profits generated by our printed products group which comprises our packaging plastic id and security printing operations this group delivers consistent and growing profit and cash flows to support our digital and it management operations as well as the corporate overhead cost primarily associated with being a public company for  the printed products group generated  million of adjusted ebitda profit which is up  from the full year of  for our dss technology management group which includes our digital division which is now primarily focused on our authentiguard product line as well as our ip monetization and technology licensing business adjusted ebitda was positive in the fourth quarter of  a milestone for this group while expected to be subject to a greater degree of fluctuation going forward this group showed the potential of significant profit growth from the early commercialization of authentiguard and the ongoing strength of our technology licensing programs for the year the group while still in the negative with a loss of  improved its adjusted ebitda performance by  finally we continue to focus on corporate expense reductions where possible which helped decrease adjusted ebitda losses in this group by  for the year furthermore going forward our corporate costs will benefit from a cross sharing arrangement we made in conjunction with an ip transaction we completed in the fourth quarter of  as we announced in november of  during the fourth quarter we entered into a comprehensive agreement with a third party funder for the acquisition and management of a large portfolio of patents in the led field this transaction was based on the value of our capabilities in the ip monetization field for which the company continues to strive to achieve returns from the various ip matters we have and our third party funding partners have invested in this new deal has had an immediate positive impact on our balance sheet and financial position and provides the company with the working capital required to manage related ip monetization program as a result of this transaction the company ended the year with a cash balance of approximately  million and a net working capital position of approximately  million furthermore as i mentioned above as a result of the transaction the company will realize the benefit of the amount of the transaction allocated to working capital of approximately  million with an ongoing offset to the companys overhead expenses for the next three years in conclusion the fourth quarter was a very positive quarter for the company and we enter  im sorry we enter  with a business generating strong core financial results and a strengthened balance sheet with that i will now turn the call over to our ceo jeff ronaldi jeffrey ronaldi thank you phil i would like to thank everyone for your continued support and interest in document security systems first as phil has described the fourth quarter continues our recent trend of strong financial performance and significantly improved financial results our business presents a blend of solid and consistent performance from business lines that have strong probable niches that have supported our investments in newer product lines primarily authentiguard our next generation brand protection offering while im excited that we now have seen the early impact of our first major authentiguard customer that we announced earlier this year this is a significant win for our company winning a global deployment for a largest global  company is a significant validation for authentiguard technology and our ability to implement and service the global customer we are excited to see the results of the implementation as our customer realizes the benefits of weeding out counterfeits in the supply chain using our technology were truly proud to have been chosen for this project the commercialization of authentiguard marks the starting point for what i believe is the next stage of our company as primarily a technology company as i have said in the past our dedication to research and new product development of our digital group has brought us to this point and were now seeing a positive effect of this focus on our financial results during the fourth quarter as expected we benefited from strong seasonal sales of our packaging group which continued to deliver significant profitability to the group in addition our plastic group had another strong quarter and is benefiting from its growing presence in the technology card market in addition our security printing group continues to expand its presence in coupons vital records and now the book publishing market where we see immense potential the response to anticopy print technologies for use in textbooks and manuals have been very positive in an industry in need of a solution to its rampant counterfeiting problems finally we believe that our continued presence in the ip monetization business is an undervalued asset of our company the funding agreement that we entered into during the quarter as phil described was a very good deal for us im excited to work on this ip monetization opportunity and please financial terms for us which have strengthened our balance sheet and limits to near zero the downside risk we have from the underlying program with regard to our share price in the current market cap im pleased that we have seen a recent increase in our stock price which has approximately doubled since our last earnings call in november this is a step in the right direction and hopefully the investor community is rediscovering our company and our value proposition to that end we are rebuilding our investor relations capabilities including the addition of jody janson who introduced us on this call for those efforts once again thank you for your continued interest in dss and ill pass the call over to robert fagenson our chairman robert robert fagenson sorry im having difficulty hearing im sorry about the background noise thank you phil thank you jeff and in summary before we take your questions after many years of patience and waiting i hope our investors and shareholders can see that we are beginning to show the inherent strength and earning power of our core businesses through aggressive cost control and increased sales we finally brought what weve long hoped for and that is sequential quarters of positive ebitda positive adjusted ebitda and these have been achieved without having a indiscernible allowing to compromise the company without losing a potential for our brand protection ip assets with the addition to the opportunities in ip we see an expanding array of larger companies that have been interested in testing and installing our brand protection and product tracking technology this is a very very positive development that weve been waiting for and i believe it bodes well for increased use and acceptance of authentiguard array of technology based products so with that and with the thanks to all of our team at dss we will throw it open to questions from operator and we will see if we have any questions from our shareholders on the line questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will take our first question from howard isis ph please go ahead unidentified analyst hi first of all i would like to extend my deep sorrow to the president of the company on his recent loss and i know about losses myself personally and i just would like to express my concern for him and his good health jeffrey ronaldi thank you very much its much appreciated unidentified analyst youre quite welcome i will lead with good things like the fourth quarter and i would like to tell you how thrilled i am i am a holder of the stock for more years than i want to say but i am glad that i have held my breath on many occasions but im glad to see were on the right track and authentiguard i just wish it the greatest and i think from what i hear it is a terrific item that you are producing i just have a couple of questions and now that we have a little bit more money free and i dont want to sound like a sorry sport but is there any chance of helping the purchasers of the stock way back when and because we have some money thats free maybe to give a new issue or something to help lighten our loads that weve been with over the last several years jeffrey ronaldi im not quite sure what you have in mind but… unidentified analyst like a buyback of some of the shares philip jones under our current bank covenants that would be very difficult to do and so were able to show some more earnings and some more capital certainly from a medium and long term perspective wed love to return money to our shareholders both new ones and long term holders but we cant take the first steps and begin to think you can run without running into problems so it is a conversation much better year from now when we see what weve been able to do for another twelve months and then find ourselves in a comfortable enough cash position that needle our banks our securities markets that are listed or our shareholders would think that we were not acting in the best interests of growing the company unidentified analyst i can appreciate that and hopefully next year when you have your annual meeting well talk about it again and be able to do something about it philip jones that would be nice unidentified analyst just have a good year philip jones thank you unidentified analyst alright take care operator operator instructions and it appears we have no further questions at this time jody janson thank you thank you all for whoever is listening in thanks to our management team and thanks to all part of the dss team who have worked so hard including the pilot who is flying over my head to produce these results and we hope to be able to have sequential calls that have more positive results so with that gentlemen jeff phil anything else you would like to add before we sign off jeffrey ronaldi i don’t just thank you for your support and we are working hard to improve the performance of the company jody janson thank you everybody thank you
