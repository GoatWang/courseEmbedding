managements expectations or beliefs concerning future events including statements regarding anticipated application of cash expected returns from rental income growth in revenue the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses rates of distribution and other matters  these and other forwardlooking statements should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the partnerships financial condition and results of operations including the following—market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate—the federal income tax consequences of rental income deductions gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the partners—resolution by the general partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted—the success of the general partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics—the effect of tenant defaults and—the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the partnership operateapplication of critical accounting policiesthe partnerships financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions  these judgments will affect the reported amounts of the partnerships assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods  it is possible that the carrying amount of the partnerships assets and liabilities or the results of reported operations will be affected if managements estimates or assumptions prove inaccuratemanagement of the partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing partner of the partnershipallocation of purchase price of acquired propertiesupon acquisition of real properties the partnership records them in the financial statements at cost  the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets consisting of land and building and to identified intangible assets and liabilities which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of inplace leases  the allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property  although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value in many cases these values will be based upon managements assessment of each property the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the assetpage  of item   managements discussion and analysis  continuedthe fair values of above market and below market inplace leases will be recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding inplace leases measured over a period equal to the noncancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods  the above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities  above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases  below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases including any bargain renewal periods  if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration all unamortized amounts of above market and below market inplace lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental incomethe fair values of inplace leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an inplace lease  direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions tenant improvements and other direct costs and are estimated in part by managements consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease  these direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases  the value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease  these intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases  if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration all unamortized amounts of inplace lease assets relating to that lease would be expensedthe determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates rental growth rates discount and capitalization rates interest rates and other variables  if managements estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price which could impact the amount of reported net incomecarrying value of propertiesproperties are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization  the partnership tests longlived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  for properties the partnership will hold and operate management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the propertys probabilityweighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value  for properties held for sale management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the propertys estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value  if the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value  changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the propertiespage  of item   managements discussion and analysis  continuedallocation of expensesaei fund management inc allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each funds affairs  they also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a funds operations based upon the number of

estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the propertymanagement believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations  leases may contain rent increases based on the increase in the consumer price index over a specified period which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases  inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value  however inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties tenants which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the net cash flow available for distributionsliquidity and capital resourcesduring the nine months ended september   the partnerships cash balances decreased  as a result of distributions paid to the partners
