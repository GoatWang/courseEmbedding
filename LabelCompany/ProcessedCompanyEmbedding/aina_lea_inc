prospectus remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders the principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public market for our common stock as of the date of this prospectus we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us of this offering however we currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes including working capital sales and marketing activities real estate development and construction general and administrative matters and capital expenditures we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire approximately  acres of real property in hawaii for development that we currently hold an option to purchase we will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering pending these uses we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing securities such as money market accounts certificates of deposit commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the us government we believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business current and future competitors may have more resources than we have our programs face competition generally from reits institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital to create programs to make these acquisitions in transaction services we face competition with other real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition of properties and we also compete with other sponsors of real estate investor programs for investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments we also compete against other real estate companies who may be chosen by a brokerdealer as an investment platform instead of us in management services we compete with other properties for viable investors for our programs’ properties we also believe that our broker dealers compete or will compete with institutions that provide or arrange for other types of financing through private or public offerings of equity or debt and from traditional bank financings real estate development is a highly competitive business we compete with numerous developers builders and others for the acquisition of property currently we are unaware of any companies that engage in the land syndication business in hawaii at this time however there can be no assurance that companies will not begin engaging in this business in hawaii and as we attempt to expand our operations we will certainly be competing with other business ranging from large multinational corporations to small start up business such as ourselves many of our competitors may have longer operating histories better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do to successfully compete in our industry we will need to  ensure that investments in our projects are affordable  that we only invest in properties in wellpriced locations  that our investment strategy is simple to understand and  that we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings however there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry we believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price we are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services company description we are a real estate development
