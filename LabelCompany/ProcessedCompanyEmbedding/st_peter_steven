two years ago has left the company st peter said he stepped down in early may after eight years with the bostonbased vc giant most recently as a managing director enlarge dr steven st peter helped add credibility to the kansas city area’s efforts in the… more file  kcbj he plans to remain active in the kansas city area and continue as chairman of aratana therapeutics an animal health company he helped found that received mpm’s sole kansas investment “my decision to leave mpm was related to a bunch of things but one was really to devote the time to focus on aratana to make sure it’s successful” st peter said adding that the parting was “amicable” “it’s not unusual to see people move from the investment role to the operating role” st peter helped mpm establish its first office away from the biosciencerich coasts in  the company bought and renovated the squarefoot building at  olathe blvd in kansas city kan that previously was a ronald mcdonald house mpm worked with california firms avalon ventures and cultivian ventures lp as well as the kansas bioscience authority to raise  million for aratana the company develops animal health products from substances originally developed for humans it has since added an additional  million from a group of smaller vc firms and angel investors mpm intends to keep the socalled heartland house which now is office space for several small companies including aratana however the firm probably won’t have a fulltime replacement for st peter in the near future “the plan going forward is steven will be using our office and as he sees opportunities he’ll show them to us” mpm coo john vander vort said he added that a handful of directors have connections to kansas or the midwest — he’s from minneapolis — and will periodically rotate through the kck office to look for deals “we have lots of people who like the midwest and see the value of that region and so we’re going to continue to fish in those waters so to speak” he said the kansas bioscience authority placed  million with mpm as part of a program to attract more investment firms mpm wasn’t required to invest the money in kansas companies but was required to set up a location in the state and spend a certain amount of time each month looking for deals vander vort said mpm will continue to meet those requirements despite the lack of a dedicated local director “i think steven did a really great job of getting us more focused on the midwest and we will continue to be focused on looking for good opportunities” he said besides being mpm’s local representative st peter worked with organizations on both sides of the state line to highlight kansas city’s nascent bioscience industry he was a speaker at a life sciences summit last year that kansas gov sam brownback sponsored “the impact steve has had has been tremendous” kba interim ceo david vranicar said vranicar said he isn’t worried about st peter’s diminishing role with mpm similarly he’s not concerned about the firm’s dedication to kansas biotech startups or adherence to its obligations in its investment agreement with the kba he said st peter will remain a point of contact between kba and the firm at least in the short term vranicar also welcomed st peter’s continuing involvement with aratana to which the kba has committed more than  million in equity and research grants vranicar said he expects to continue calling on st peter for his expertise in venture capital advice on potential deals and introductions to people in the industry he said mpm’s local office served as a wakeup call to investment firms nationwide pushing them to consider midwestern startups “it added a bit of credibility and a bit of external validation of what we’ve been trying to tell people which is that there’s a lot of interesting things going on here” vranicar said aratana therapeutics the kansas city kan company was established in late  by thenmpm capital managing director steven st peter and veterinarian david rosen its mission is to serve as a conduit for the development of animal health products from substances already proven effective in the human market the company which now has seven employees is working on two products for the companionanimal market that it has licensed from japanese firm raqualia pharma inc the first is a pain reliever with fewer side effects than current medications and the second is a compound that helps encourage eating and increases strength in animals with cancer or recovering from surgery mpm and a group of other investors provided the initial  million in capital which officials said should take the first two products all the way through to commercialization aratana has raised an additional  million to pursue
