opinion affirming      before acree chief judge jones and moore judges moore judge david sangster appeals a judgment of the jefferson circuit court dismissing his civil rights action against the abovecaptioned appellees ie the kentucky board of medical licensure and its members in their individual capacities upon review we affirm factual and procedural history on august   the kentucky board of medical licensure kbml entered an administrative order indefinitely restricting david sangster s license to practice medicine in particular the order prohibited sangster from performing any act constituting the practice of medicine as the term is defined in kentucky revised statutes krs  it provided that the kbml retained the sole discretion to grant any petition to amend or terminate the order of restriction and assuming the kbml granted any such petition the order also provided that sangster s reinstatement to the practice of medicine would be subject to certain conditions including his payment of  in costs attributable to his disciplinary proceedings the basis of sangster s appeal stems from an action he filed in jefferson circuit court nearly one year later regarding the aforementioned order and the disciplinary proceedings that accompanied it essentially sangster  asserted that the kbml s order was  the product of the kbml s fraud and misconduct involving its administration of its authorizing legislation and the provisions of krs b et seq  in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions  in excess of the statutory authority of the kmbl  without support of substantial evidence on the whole record  arbitrary capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion  based on ex parte communications which substantially prejudiced his rights and likely affected the outcome of his disciplinary proceedings and  affected by a failure of the hearing officer conducting the proceeding to be disqualified due to bias sangster s action was not for the judicial review of administrative action pursuant to krs b when he filed this action sangster already had another action pending before another court in jefferson circuit court filed pursuant to that statute and that action also relied upon roughly the same allegations to the contrary sangster s subsequent action relied upon these allegations to support a  united states code usc §  claim for violations of procedural due process in which he asked for monetary damages and injunctive relief against the kbml and its members in their individual capacities  it appears that sangster s action for judicial review kbml v david p sangster md ci remains pending before the jefferson circuit court as of the date of this opinion   usc §  provides civil recourse for violations of protected rights in relevant part §  provides every person who under color of any statute ordinance regulation or custom    of any state    subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit in equity or other proper proceeding for redress     rather than answering sangster s complaint the abovecaptioned appellees filed a kentucky rules of civil procedure cr f motion to dismiss specifically the kbml asserted immunity from suit based upon the eleventh amendment of the united states constitution whereas the members of the kbml who had been sued in their individual capacities asserted absolute quasijudicial immunity thereafter the circuit court granted the appellees motion and dismissed sangster s claims for monetary relief on both bases the circuit court further dismissed sangster s claim for injunctive relief after determining that sangster had failed to articulate in his complaint how the kbml violated any of his federally protected procedural due process rights this appeal followed additional facts will be discussed as they become relevant to our analysis below analysis sangster puts forth three arguments in his brief respectively titled the individual board members are not entitled to absolute immunity absolute immunity for the adjudicative function is not available under these circumstances and qualified immunity under krs  is not available to the concerned kbml members the thrust of his arguments is that his  usc §  actions against the kbml and its members in their individual capacities for monetary damages should not have been dismissed on immunity grounds the question of  sangster s arguments on appeal are limited to whether the circuit court erred in finding the kbml and its individuals immune to suit the circuit court did not dismiss sangster s claim for injunctive relief under  usc §  on the basis of any form of immunity and sangster s brief does not include any argument regarding the propriety of the circuit court s decision to  immunity is a matter of law which this court reviews de novo rowan county v sloas  swd   ky  estate of clark ex rel mitchell v daviess county  swd   ky app  as it relates to sangster s  usc §  claim against the kbml for monetary relief we agree with the circuit court s decision to dismiss however it was unnecessary for the circuit court to even reach the issue of whether the kbml was entitled to any form of immunity because sangster s claim failed for a more basic reason the kbml is a state agency and states state agencies and state officials sued in their official capacities for money damages are not persons subject to suit under §  will v mich dept of state police  us    sct    ledd   in rebuttal sangster points to krs  which he asserts is an avenue for holding the kbml liable for monetary damages under  usc §  it provides there shall be no monetary liability on the part of and no cause of action for damages shall arise against the board any current or former member officer administrator staff member committee member representative agent consultant or employee of the board either as a part of the board s operation or as an individual as the result of any act omission proceeding conduct or decision related to his official duties undertaken or performed within the scope of the function of the board except dismiss his claim for prospective injunctive relief therefore we deem this argument waived see eg osborne v payne  swd   ky   any part of a judgment appealed from that is not briefed is affirmed as being confessed   see eg krs   where actual malice is shown or willful misconduct is involved as it goes sangster s theory is that this kentucky statute effectively expands the scope of a federal  usc §  action to include the kbml in instances where the kbml s offending conduct is outside its operation unrelated to the scope of its function or indicative of actual malice or willful misconduct even if this were a viable interpretation of krs  however sangster overlooks that under the united states supreme court s holding in will a state and its agencies cannot be sued under section  even if the state consents because it is powerless to rewrite the congressional definition of person the manner in which we should view federal causes of action in state courts was specifically stated in howlett v rose  us    sct   ledd   the elements of and the defenses to a federal cause of action are defined by federal law see eg monessen southwestern r co v morgan  us     sct   ledd   chesapeake  ohio r co v kuhn  us      sct   led   a state may not by statute or common law create a cause of action under §  against an entity whom congress has not subjected to liability moor v county of alameda  us      sct   ledd   since this court has construed the word person in §  to exclude states neither a federal court nor a state court may entertain a §  action against such a defendant  this federal rule was restated in arizonans for official english v arizona  us    sct    ledd   as follows we have held however that §  actions do not lie against a state will v michigan dept of state police  us     sct   ledd   thus the claim for relief the ninth circuit found sufficient to overcome mootness was nonexistent the barrier was not as the ninth circuit supposed eleventh amendment immunity which the state could waive the stopper was that §  creates no remedy against a state this in turn leads to a discussion of sangster s  usc §  claim for monetary relief against the kbml board members in their individual capacities sangster argues that it was error for the circuit court to dismiss this claim on the basis of absolute quasijudicial immunity for two reasons first sangster argues that kentucky ie krs  has abrogated any form of immunity to a  usc §  suit for offending conduct of individual board members that is outside the operation of the kbml unrelated to the scope of its function or indicative of actual malice or willful misconduct as before however sangster overlooks that a  usc §  suit is a federal cause of action it was the decision of congress to provide certain forms of absolute and qualified immunity to  usc §  claims howlett  us at   sct at  kentucky has no authority to override it see id at    congress surely did not intend to assign to state courts and legislatures a conclusive role in the formative function of defining and characterizing the  essential elements of a federal cause of action  citing wilson v garcia  us    sct    ledd   as such irrespective of krs  the elements of and the defenses to a federal cause of action are defined by federal law howlett  us at   sct at  emphasis added not state law next sangster argues that federal law and precedent interpreting  usc §  would not accord the individual kbml board members absolute quasijudicial immunity from suit we disagree as a general matter absolute judicial immunity and absolute quasijudicial immunity apply to  usc §  claims for monetary relief in quatkemeyer v kentucky bd of medical licensure  fedappx  th cir  the federal court of appeals for the sixth circuit explained absolute immunity against suits for money damages is well established for judges and such immunity has also been extended to nonjudicial officers performing quasijudicial duties bush v rauch  fd   th cir  see also greater la council on deafness inc v zolin  fd   th cir   quasijudicial immunity like judicial immunity derives historically from the recognition that participation in the court system raises a significant risk of entanglement in vexatious litigation  quoting mitchell v forsyth  us    sct   ledd   quasijudicial immunity  in accordance with federal rules of appellate procedure frap  a court may not prohibit or restrict the citation of federal judicial opinions orders judgments or other written dispositions that have been i designated as unpublished  and ii issued after january   while kentucky courts are not bound by frap  the federal judiciary has determined that all of its opinions rendered after january   have equally persuasive import without regard to their designation as unpublished we should take no less a view of those opinions  extends to those persons performing tasks so integral or intertwined with the judicial process that these persons are considered an arm of the judicial officer who is immune bush  fd at  the supreme court has endorsed a functional approach in determining whether an official is entitled to absolute immunity under this approach a court looks to the nature of the function performed not the identity of the actor who performed it collyer v darling  fd   th cir  citation omitted quoting bush  fd at  the party claiming absolute immunity bears the burden of establishing a justification for that immunity antoine v byers  anderson inc  us    sct   ledd   burns v reed  us    sct   ledd   to determine whether the doctrine of judicial immunity applies to officials other than judges a court must determine whether performance of a function requires exercise of discretionary judgment antoine  us at   sct  see also imbler v pachtman  us    sct   ledd   the supreme court has ruled upon the applicability of quasijudicial immunity to state agencies because the legal remedies already available to the defendant in an agency enforcement proceeding provide sufficient checks on agency zeal we hold that those agency officials who perform certain functions analogous to those of a prosecutor and who are responsible for the decision to initiate or continue a proceeding subject to agency adjudication are entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for their parts in that decision butz v economou  us    sct   ledd   id at   quatkemeyer also determined that federal law accords the individual members of the kbml immunity for any quasijudicial acts taken within the function of their positions it is undisputed that the kentucky board of medical licensure is a state agency previously butz has been applied to medical licensing boards granting the members of the boards absolute immunity when sued for damages in their individual capacity see watts v burkhart  fd  th cir  bettencourt v bd of registration in med of mass  fd  st cir  horwitz v state bd of med exam rs of colo  fd  th cir  pursuant to the functional approach that was adopted in forrester v white  us    sct   ledd   the determination is centered upon the action of the individual as explained in bush a prosecutor who undertakes acts in the preparation or initiation of judicial proceedings is entitled to absolute immunity on the other hand when a prosecutor performs administrative acts unrelated to judicial proceedings qualified immunity is all that is available  fd at  citations omitted thus while members of state medical boards may receive immunity it is not presumed merely because they are members of those boards the members of the kentucky board of medical licensure exercise the requisite adjudicatory functioning for quasijudicial immunity the board exercises authority over medical practitioners in kentucky and has authority to issue subpoenas conduct various levels of inquiries make findings and issue different orders see krs §  by allowing its determination to be reviewed by the courts rather than another agency body or third party arbitrator the board provides one who is dissatisfied ample opportunity to seek redress see krs §  id  sangster argues that the kbml does not have the appropriate safeguards that were present in watts and therefore pursuant to cleavinger v saxner  us   sct   ledd   absolute immunity does not exist for its members in their individual capacities this argument was offered and rejected in quatkemeyer and because we agree with the reasoning of that case we adopt it in watts a physician filed a §  action against the members of the tennessee board of medical examiners individually for damages based upon violations of due process and equal protection  fd at  having found it persuasive that all members of the tennessee board were physicians we determined the members were independent professionals entitled to quasijudicial immunity and reversed the district court decision id at   in cleavinger the supreme court determined that disciplinary committee members lacked the independence that characterizes judges and therefore were not entitled to quasijudicial immunity  us at   sct  the committee in cleavinger was composed of bureau of prison employees who were direct subordinates of the warden who reviewed their decisions and were under obvious pressure to resolve a disciplinary dispute in favor of the institution and their fellow employee id at   sct  they were not impartial and the hearing body was not detached or neutral id while it is correct to say neither the facts nor the statutory guidelines in the instant case are identical to those in watts this case is far more analogous to watts than cleavinger here the board is comprised of independent professionals whom were not direct subordinates of the person or entity that appoints them further no party alleges its decisions were reviewed by the governor also the board is comprised of fifteen  members eleven are licensed physicians one is an osteopathic physician and the remaining three are representatives of healthcare consumer organizations who are not associated with or financially interested in the business regulated see krs §  fn fn krs §  requires that the board consist of fifteen members including the commissioner of public health the dean of the university of kentucky college of medicine the vice dean for clinical affairs of the university of louisville school of medicine the dean of the university of pikeville school of osteopathic medicine and eleven  members appointed by the governor of the governor s appointees §  provides that a one  member shall be a licensed osteopathic physician and shall be appointed from a list of three  names submitted by the kentucky osteopathic association b seven  members shall be licensed medical physicians and may be appointed from a list of three  names submitted for each position by the kentucky medical association in making appointments under this paragraph the governor shall ensure that the physician members represented different specialties from a broad cross section of the medical profession and c three  members shall be citizens at large who are  representatives of any recognized consumer advocacy groups with an interest in the delivery of health care and are not associated with or financially interest in the practice or business regulated the board in watts consisted of five members whom were required by statute to be professionals watts  fd at  however the slight differences in the makeup of the board in the instant case and watts do not result in a denial of immunity as long as the board is made up primarily of professionals and required to be independent sangster argues that the individual kbml members are not entitled to quasijudicial immunity for several other reasons but many of these reasons were also rejected in quatkemeyer first he alleges that the kbml did not adequately apprise him of its charges relating to his purported misconduct prior to his disciplinary proceeding however in watts the plaintiff s due process claim rested on allegations that the proceedings before the board were defective because among other things the charges had not been stated with sufficient specificity quatkemeyer  fedappx at  citing watts  fd at  next sangster alleges that certain findings within the kbml s order misinterpret the evidence of record are not supported by substantial evidence or were based upon evidence that should have been excluded the legal conclusions within the kbml s order misapply and misinterpret the applicable statutes and the kbml s own standards for physician conduct the hearing officer s recommended order failed to include a recommended disposition as required by krs  b and that the kbml failed to adequately review the record before ultimately adopting the hearing officer s recommended order however sangster s argument is misplaced the challenged acts he describes such as relying upon wrong analyses and false allegations are prosecutorial in nature if sangster s contention is that the kbml failed to properly consider the evidence such failure would not negate immunity the function and action of the kbml was prosecutorial or adjudicatory in nature regardless of how ineffectively the kbml may have performed it id at  finally sangster argues that the individual kbml members are not entitled to absolute quasijudicial immunity because they were biased against him the hearing officer was biased against him and because the hearing officer appointed by the kbml in the instant case was a lawyer rather than a medical professional however it is the very function of absolute immunity to defeat a suit from the outset and immunize even capricious decisions motivated by prejudice bias or greed see stump v sparkman  us    sct    ledd   see also pierson v ray  us    sct    ledd   noting absolute immunity applies even when judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly bradley v fisher  us    led   if an act is judicial in character and within the court s jurisdiction the defendant cannot be subjected to responsibility for it in a civil action however erroneous the act may have been and however injurious in its consequences it may have proved to the plaintiff  and in any event the fact  that the hearing officer in the instant case was a lawyer appointed by the kbml does not render him biased or the procedural safeguards inadequate quatkemeyer  fedappx at  in sum we agree with quatkemeyer in that the kbml s authorizing legislation and procedures adequately protect the policy interests identified in watts the kbml s position is akin to that of judges or prosecutors the potential for vexatious lawsuits is great and sufficient safeguards exist to protect a physician s constitutional rights id at  citations omitted moreover taking the allegations in his complaint as true sangster has merely asserted that the individual kbml members acted with bad faith or malice rendered an incorrect decision took action in excess of their authority or committed grave procedural errors over the course of his disciplinary proceedings none of which are adequate to vitiate absolute immunity from suit stump  us at  and   sct  and  conclusion  to be clear the supreme court has held that absolute judicial immunity and thus by extension absolute quasijudicial immunity is generally overcome in only two sets of circumstances first a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions ie actions not taken in the judge s judicial capacity mireles v waco  us    sct    ledd   citing forrester v white  us   sct    ledd   and stump  us at   sct at  second a judge is not immune for actions though judicial in nature taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction id at  sct at  citing stump  us at   sct at  and bradley v fisher  us   because the present case implicates neither of these exceptional circumstances the individual members of the kbml are entitled to absolute quasijudicial immunity and all monetary claims against them must therefore be dismissed  for the foregoing reasons the court finds that absolute quasijudicial immunity protects the individual kbml members from sangster s claims against them in their individual capacities and that sangster failed to assert a cognizable cause of action against the kbml as a state agency therefore the jefferson circuit court is affirmed all concur brief for appellant brief for

the board initiated an investigation of dr sangster concerning allegations that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with a patient and that he had inappropriately andor excessively prescribed controlled substances to his patients following an emergency hearing the parties agreed to resolve the case informally without conducting an evidentiary hearing represented by counsel dr sangster entered into an agreed order of suspensionprobation which was signed on october   the order contained several stipulated conclusions of law pertinent to this appeal are the following items given the conflicting nature of the evidence anticipated at the administrative hearing there would be sufficient evidence for the hearing panel to conclude that a violation had occurred or that a violation had not occurred the parties expressly agreed that there are sufficient legal grounds for the hearing panel to impose an indefinite restriction upon his kentucky medical license pursuant to krs  and  while the licensee disagrees with the ultimate conclusion he agrees that the board could present sufficient evidence during a hearing for a hearing panel to conclude that he had engaged in predatory practices in his medical practice the licensee understands that such a finding would support revocation of or an indefinite restriction upon his kentucky medical license rather than risk revocation of his license the licensee agrees to an indefinite restriction under the terms set out belowthe terms governing the indefinite restriction included placing the license of dr sangster on probation through march   dr sangster also agreed not to reapply for his drug enforcement administration permit until he had successfully completed a miniresidency on “the use and prescribing of controlled substances”shortly after signing the agreed order dr sangster began to challenge its validity repeatedly on a variety of grounds in march  he filed a petition to correct errors relating to the opinions of board consultant dr orson smith he requested that the board consider the possibility that dr smiths testimony was false and that he had engaged in willful misconduct the board refused to consider the petition in july  dr sangster filed a grievance against dr ec seeley relating to his conduct as a consultant on the case the board again refused to entertain the grievance commenting “we will not relitigate your challenges to the testimony presented in your disciplinary action” dr sangster next filed a complaint against dr seeley and the board itself in jefferson circuit court the jefferson circuit court granted dr seeleys motion to dismiss the complaint that order was affirmed by this court in an opinion rendered on march   camr  wl dr sangster then filed a second complaint in jefferson circuit court once again naming dr seeley as a defendantbut now naming the governor of kentucky as a defendant as well the defendants motion to dismiss was granted on december   this court affirmed the ruling of the circuit court in an opinion rendered on may   camr  wl on december   dr sangster filed a third complaint naming as defendants the former chief of the jefferson county police department william carcara and a former investigator for the board jose aponte this complaint focused on the narcotics investigation by the police which led to the disciplinary action undertaken by the board against dr sangster the circuit court granted the defendants motion to dismissthe appeal now before us relates to a fourth complaint that was filed by dr sangster on january   against the board and its general counsel lloyd vest in this complaint dr sangster alleged that various witnesses had committed perjury against him that the board had suborned perjury and that the board even coerced them into testifying against him he also alleged that by allowing a copy of the agreed order of suspensionprobation to be published on its website the board violated his right to confidentiality conferred by krs  j a portion of the open records act finally he claimed that the action of the board had violated his constitutional right to equal protection on november   the circuit court entered an order granting the defendants motion to dismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations res judicata and lack of a right to confidentialityon appeal dr sangster contends that the board defamed him in publishing the agreed order of suspension probation on the boards website by rendering it available to the general public although the allegations contained in the order were never proven he claims that they have been published as if they were trueour review of the record reveals a claim of defamation was never raised in the pleadings before the circuit court “the court of appeals is without authority to review issues not raised in or decided by the trial court” regional jail authority v tackett  swd   ky we are not at liberty to address this newly raised allegationdr sangster also argues that the availability of the order on the boards website contravenes provisions of the kentucky open records act the board argues that the agreed order is a public record as that term is defined in krs “public record” means all books papers maps photographs cards tapes discs diskettes recordings software or other documentation owned used in the possession of or retained by a public agency “public record” shall not include any records owned or maintained by or for a body referred to in subsection h of this section that are not related to functions activities programs or operations funded by state or local authoritydr sangster nonetheless contends that the board violated krs j which provides that public scrutiny need not be extended todeliberations of judicial or quasijudicial bodies regarding individual adjudications or appointments at which neither the person involved his representatives nor any other individual not a member of the agencys governing body or staff is presenthe believes that when the agreed order was made available to the public this statutory provision was violated because the results of the boards deliberations were involved his argument is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the statute krs  pertains to actual public access to and attendance at meetingsnot the documents generated as a result of those meetings in short he has erroneously relied on the term deliberations and has lifted it out of context in a manner that affords him neither relevance nor reliefdr sangster also contends that the publication of the order violates his right to equal protection because other regulatory agencies such as the kentucky bar association and the kentucky board of nursing maintain the confidentiality of accused members who are exonerated he bases this argument on the mistaken premise that he was indeed exonerated ie that he was found not guilty of the allegations against him however dr sangster expressly agreed that there were sufficient grounds for the hearing panel to revoke his medical license rather than risking an adverse outcome he accepted the terms offered in a manner analogous to entry of an alford plea by a criminal defendant in order to obtain a more lenient sentence see north carolina v alford  us   sct   ledd   dr sangster was not exonerated and had expressly admitted that the charges against him might be proven his case is wholly unique and distinguishable from the examples that he cites from disciplinary matters before the kentucky bar association and the kentucky board of nursingthe appellees argue that dr sangsters claims are barred under the doctrine of res judicata which provides thata final judgment precludes subsequent litigation not only of those issues upon which the court was required to form an opinion and pronounce judgment but also of matters included within those issues and matters that with the exercise of reasonable diligence might have been raised at the timewhittaker v cecil  swd   ky citing newman v newman  swd   ky we agree dr sangster has provided no explanation as to why the issues raised in this appeal could not have been raised in
