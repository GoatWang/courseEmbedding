and all parties to the action rendered  august   not to be published ixyrrxrre cvurf of fi scmr daniel scott tows appellant on appeal from clinton circuit court honorable eddie c  lovelace judge no cr v commonwealth of kentucky appellee memorandum opinion of the court affirming appellant daniel scott towe claims the evidence was insufficient on all counts and that the lower court erred in finding him competent to stand trial  finding no error we affirm appellant was convicted of assault in the first degree wanton endangerment in the first degree and tampering with physical evidence he received a sentence of twenty  years on the first count five  years on the second count and five  years on the third count  the sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a total of thirty  years imprisonment  i factual background on may   appellant shot morris mcmillen in the side with a  caliber pistol  mcmillen survived but suffered horrendous pain and permanent impairment as the result of the gunshot wound  appellant worked for av conner who owned a farm adjacent to that of mcmillen  on the day of the shooting appellant had been drinking  he was going to a place on the conner farm to recover fencing material from prior repairs  he had his girlfriend tonia daniels with him at a turnaround on a gravel boundary road between the conner and mcmillen properties appellant ran into the victim  the latter was with brandon mason standing next to his pickup truck drinking beer appellant struck up a conversation with the two men he began to use vulgar language and made coarse references to what he was going to do sexually with his girlfriend at a remote part of the farm he even offered her services to mcmillen and mason mcmillen told appellant that they didnt want any trouble and asked him to leave  he did but about twenty minutes later appellant returned in his pickup truck he pulled out his pistol said something and shot mcmillen who was leaning against the tailgate of his truck  appellant then pulled the hammer back on the pistol and pointed it at mason who turned and ran no additional shots were fired  appellant then left mason went to the aid of mcmillen who was seriously wounded  because mason was unable to load mcmillen in the truck he left to get help when the kentucky state police officers arrived at the scene mcmillen was being loaded in an ambulance as mcmillen was not unconscious the officers were able to learn from him how the shooting had occurred  after an extensive search appellant was found hidden in the loft of a barn on the conner property  he was arrested without incident the  caliber pistol was found hidden under a mattress among weeds and leaves just to the left of the back door of the barn where appellant had been hiding  five live rounds and one spent cartridge were found in the pistol  ii analysis a sufficiency of the evidence as to each offense charged at the end of the commonwealths case and at the end of the evidence appellant moved for a directed verdict based on insufficient evidence  the commonwealth argues appellant did not properly preserve this issue for our review we disagree and will consider the merits of appellants appeal this court has set out the standard for a directed verdict in commonwealth v benham   sw d at  in benham we stated  on motion for directed verdict the trial court must draw all fair and reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the commonwealth  if the evidence is sufficient to induce a reasonable juror to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty a directed verdict should not be given  for the purpose of ruling on the motion the trial court must assume that the evidence for the commonwealth is true but reserving to the jury questions as to the credibility and weight to be given to such testimony  id  at  this court went on to note that on appellate review the test of a directed verdict is if under the evidence as a whole it would be clearly unreasonable for a jury to find guilt only then the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal  id  this is the standard that must be applied to appellants sufficiency of the evidence claims  under the kentucky rules of civil procedure cr a motion for a directed verdict shall state the specific grounds therefor see cr   see also pate v  commonwealth   s wd   ky   further a motion fora directed verdict must be made both at the close of the commonwealths case and at the close of the evidence  see baker v commonwealth   s wd   ky   appellant complied with this later requirement  as to the former requirement while it could be argued it is a better practice to be more specific as to the grounds for the motion the trial court clearly understood and had the opportunity to rule on appellants motions   tampering with physical evidence kentucky law states in pertinent part that  a person is guilty of tampering with physical evidence when believing that an official proceeding is pending or may be instituted he  a destroys mutilates conceals removes or alters physical evidence which he believes is about to be produced or used in the official proceeding with intent to impair its verity or availability in the official proceeding  see kirs   in applying this statute this court has stated that the compelling logic    is that one who has committed a criminal act and then conceals or removes the evidence of the crime does so in contemplation that the evidence would be used in an official proceeding which might be instituted against him burdell v commonwealth   s w d   ky   at trial appellant claims that his girlfriend took the gun from him and hid it the jury did not believe him the evidence was overwhelming that appellant shot mcmillen with the pistol ran from the scene and was later found hiding in a barn  the pistol was also found hidden nearby  it was clearly not unreasonable for the jury to conclude that appellant while on the run knew he would be held legally responsible for his act and therefore concealed the weapon used in the shooting  even accepting appellants argument that it was daniels who took the gun from him and concealed it it could be inferred that such was done at his request or with his acquiescence  further appellants own testimony indicated he understood the police would be coming to investigate the incident under these circumstances we cannot say it was clearly unreasonable for the jury to find appellant guilty of tampering with physical evidence  thus the court did not err in allowing this charge to go to the jury  wanton endangerment in the first degree appellant argues the court erred in allowing the charge of wanton endangerment to be considered by the jury he points out that regardless of whether the revolver was ever pointed at mason no threats were made  further appellant points out that no additional shots were fired under kentucky law a person is guilty of wanton endangerment in the first degree when under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person see krs  in commonwealth v clemons  this court concluded in certain circumstances depending on the existence of other facts pointing a firearm at another person may be sufficient to constitute a violation of krs    swd   ky    specifically we concluded that the pointing a loaded firearm at police accompanied by threats created an explosive situation sufficient to support an instruction under krs    id the court of appeals revisited this issue in key v commonwealth   swd  kyapp   in key the court of appeals concluded that the pointing of a gun whether loaded or unloaded provided there is reason to believe the gun may be loaded at any person constitutes conduct that creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person in violation of krs   id at   agreeing with the reasoning expressed in clemons  supra  and key supra  we find appellants argument to be without merit appellant drove up to mcmillens pickup pulled a revolver and shot mcmillen  mason who was standing by mcmillens pickup saw mcmillen fall to the ground  mason then saw appellant point the gun at him and begin to cock the hammer back  having every reason to believe the gun was loaded and that he was about to become the next target mason fled  under these  circumstances we cannot say it was clearly unreasonable for the jury to find appellant guilty of wanton endangerment  thus the court did not err in allowing this charge to go to the jury   assault in the first degree once again appellant argues the commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to support the charge sent to the jury in particular he argues the commonwealth failed to present any evidence as to intent and that the commonwealths case provided no evidence as to a motive for the shooting  appellant emphasizes the fact that there was no evidence of prior trouble between him and mcmillen  without such evidence he argues the charge should never have been sent to the jury a person is guilty of assault in the first degree when he intentionally causes serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument  see krs  in essence there are three elements to this offense  the assailants mental state  the means of attack and  the resultant injury  see welborn v commonwealth   swd   ky  commonwealth v hammond  swd   ky   there is no dispute as to the existence of sufficient evidence as to the means of attack and the seriousness of the resultant injury instead appellants challenge goes to motive and intent  the commonwealths evidence demonstrated appellant made two visits to conners farm on may th during the first visit appellants vulgar language led mcmillen to tell him they didnt want any trouble and that he should leave according to the commonwealth appellant did leave but then returned to the farm it was during the second visit that appellant shot mcmillen  at trial appellant made no attempt to deny the fact that he intentionally shot mcmillen  rather he attempted to present a case of selfdefense  the jury was free to reject his selfdefense claim given the facts presented at trial we cannot say it was clearly unreasonable for the jury to return a verdict of guilty as to assault in the first degree further we cannot say the court erred in allowing this charge to go to the jury b competency to stand trial appellant argues the court erred in finding he was competent to stand trial  the record indicates the court ordered appellant to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the kentucky correctional psychiatric center at a hearing held on april   the court heard testimony from dr horace stewart a licensed clinical psychologist  according to appellants brief dr stewart testified appellant did not meet the criteria for insanity and that appellant was being treated successfully with medication  under these circumstances dr stewart believed appellant was competent to stand trial in analyzing this claim we must begin by noting appellant failed to include the above material in the record for review  as noted by this court in commonwealth v thompson   s wd   ky  when the complete record is not before the appellate court that court must assume that the omitted record supports the decision of the trial court beyond that we note that appellant pointed to no evidence contrary to that which he attributed to dr stewart  instead he merely disagrees with the experts conclusions  even were we inclined to look beyond the missing record there is insufficient evidence to support this argument as hereinbefore stated appellant claimed selfdefense  he articulated that when he arrived at the scene mcmillen and mason were cooking methamphetamine  he testified that he was attacked by mcmillen and that he shot him in selfdefense  clearly appellant was capable of communicating with his attorney and assisting in his own defense for these reasons we find appellants argument as to competency to be without merit  conclusion having found sufficient evidence existed as to each offense we find the court did not err in submitting each of the charges to the jury further as we must assume the record supports the courts determination as to appellants competency to stand trial we deny his argument as to this issue for these reasons we affirm appellants conviction by the clinton circuit court  all
