spp and is established as an independent company  saf the swedish employers association and lo the swedish trade union confederation decide to replace the definedbenefit stp plan with the definedcontribution saflo contractual pension plan at the same time the decision is made to open up the plan to competition starting in  work is started on building a brand and creating awareness about the company the slogan a little more to live on is launched as part of the companys brand image  a pension selection process is carried out where  people under the saflo contractual pension plan are given the opportunity to individually choose a pension company in competition with the major insurance companies amf pension succeeds in retaining over  per cent of its customers amf pension starts a fund management company and unitlinked insurance company in order to offer unitlinked products to pensionsavers amf pension begins offering private pension savings and itpk insurance a

product amf active is a flexible solution that gives policyholders a convenient way of switching their pension savings between traditional life and unitlinked insurance management transfer rights are introduced for all private pension savings  amf pension expands its successful venture into the corporate market among other things the company is awarded the assignment of handling early retirement pensions for ericsson employees  due to financial strains many life companies are forced to reduce their pension benefits and rescind previously allocated dividends owing to strong finances and proficient asset management amf pension did not have to resort to either of these measures  the swedish financial supervisory authority presents its traffic light system for supervising life insurance companies as one of the markets financially strongest companies amf pension announces an extra bonus allocation giving customers a combined total of sek  billion in pension dividends to meet new requirements made by the financial supervisory authority and others amf pension establishes a strategic risk management unit a separate corporate governance unit is also established  according to an agreement between the confederation of swedish enterprise and the swedish trade union confederation lo surpluses arising from successful asset management are to be apportioned among the employers in  such surplus was repaid to the employers by waiving them from payment of sek  billion in premiums toward the saflo contractual pension plan and waiver of premium insurance with afa insurance in spring  a major step is taken in the swedish pension market with the conclusion of negotiations between the confederation of swedish enterprise and ptk the council for negotiation and cooperation on a new itp plan the agreement opens up the itp market to competition with a new agreement that will apply for all salaried employees born in  and later  amf pension was named eligible option for both

sector employees selected their pension company saflo collective agreement occupational pensions amfs market share was slightly more than  per cent equivalent to  customers actively or passively entrusting amf with the management of their occupational pensions this made amf the only company that could be selected for both unitlinked and traditional insurance in all four major collective agreement areas saflo itp kapkl and pa  in february amf implemented the first reallocation in the companys history  per cent the reallocation was a consequence of sharp stock market declines in late  and early  despite the reallocation amf is the life insurance company that has generated the greatest total return in the past  years  in april a change was made in amfs consolidation policy which implied a more direct return model based on returns instead of on dividends with the change in the consolidation policy the surplus that was previously used to level out the performance over time was no longer needed consequently this money was distributed among amfs customers increasing their pension assets by on average of  per cent in the spring employees in the private sector chose their

total return of  per cent for  amf is still on top when it comes to delivering the best pension to customers amf is still the life insurance company that has produced the best returns over the past  years  on  may  amf launched a new type of traditional assurance where the risk level of savings changes progressively generally this means a higher risk level during savers younger years and a lower risk level as they approach retirement and that amf makes guaranteed savings more secure the nearer the saver comes to retirement in  this product was available for the pa  collective pension agreement only in spring  amf acquired  per cent of property company dombron intressenter ab from ap the fourth swedish national pension fund later in  this company changed corporate name to rikshem

are returned to savers sek  million was returned to amfs customers funds from fee revenues left after all costs had been covered  amf was reassigned as a nonoptional provider in the saflo contractual pension segment until  in the saflo and itpitpk contractual pension segments amf was also an optional provider for traditional assurance and unitlinked assurance again in itpitpk amf was the most
