diverse properties  reprinted below with permission from value investor insight download the pdf down to earth longadmired real estate developer forest city enterprises’ rocky navigation of the financial crisis seems to have put investors persistently on edge has the time finally come to forgive and forget by ted crawford long considered a commercial real estate development powerhouse forest city enterprises took it on the chin in the financial crisis forced to raise equity at dilutive prices after overextending both its balance sheet and development pipeline from a high above  in  the shares fell below  in march  now a real estate investment trust the company has made strides in climbing back into the market’s good graces  it generates predictable cash flows from a diverse portfolio of properties in desirable markets higherprofile examples include the new york times building in manhattan atlantic center in brooklyn the yards mixeduse development adjacent to nationals park in washington dc and a lifesciences property portfolio around the mit campus in cambridge ma  business has been good driven by expense reductions and record industrywide occupancy levels forest city’s net operating income grew  in the first quarter even better says jason wolf comanagerof the third avenue real estate fund forest city has “derisked its strategy considerably” it has sold noncore assets and reduced net debt to ebitda from x in  to x a ratio likely to reach x over the next year or two the debt makeup has improved with mostly nonrecourse fixedrate mortgages with  average interest rates its ratio of development assets to total assets has decreased from  precrisis to around  today with a focus on core markets forest city is now poised for growth wolf’s comanager ryan dobratz expects its funds from operations ffo to increase  annually driven by improving economics at operating properties further cost cuts and the lowerrisk monetization of its pipeline that comes from building out already established developments the bottom line the market isn’t giving the company adequate credit for having “derisked” its strategy in recent years says jason wolf by selling noncore assets cutting debt and focusing on more mature developments using peer cap rates on operating assets and privatemarket values on development assets he pegs the company’s net asset value in the mids despite all this dobratz says forest city’s shares trade at their biggest discount to net asset value outside of the financial crisis in  years using peer cap rates of  on operating assets and valuing development assets based on privatemarket transactions he pegs the company’s nav in the mids the large discount and today’s wide spread of spot cap rates over treasurybond rates he adds should provide some cushion if interest rates rise two catalysts could drive new demand for the stock as tax loss carryforwards burn off dobratz expects the company’s dividend to grow at nearly twice the growth in ffo attracting yieldhungry investors in addition in september real estate will become its own sector in the sp and msci indices dobratz believes this will highlight equity funds’ systematic underweighting of real estate which he estimates if corrected could bring  billion in fresh capital to the  trillion us equityreit market “forest city has changed so much for the better” he says “maybe having an expanded audience will help recognize that”   value investor media inc all rights reserved   important information  this information does not constitute an offer or solicitation
