diluted we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to secure the additional cash or working capital we may require to continue our operations going concern as discussed in the notes to our

additional capital it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern critical accounting policies and estimates in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management discussion and analysis the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any accounting policies fit this definition contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements contractual arrangements the company did not have any contractual arrangements
