reading the main story photo david crane the chief executive of nrg has stepped down but will assist in the transition of his replacement through the end of the year credit steve marcusreuters a little more than a year ago david crane was busy broadcasting plans to transform nrg from a conventional power producer to a new breed of green utilityin charge of the company for more than  years mr crane had been investing in wind farms and buying small startups to help capture emerging markets like rooftop solar electricvehicle charging and home automation all part of a bid he wrote to shareholders to become like an amazon apple facebook or google of electricityif that indeed comes to pass he will not be there to see itmr crane  stepped down as chief executive the company said thursday and mauricio gutierrez who has been executive vice president and chief operating officer since  will take his placethe company’s stock tumbled over the last several months a decline that went largely unabated despite a reorganization and shift in strategy announced by mr crane in september advertisement continue reading the main story “he clearly had a vision for the power company of the future and wanted nrg to be that company and took real steps toward that” said shayle kann who leads gtm research which focuses on clean energy industries “and then wall street didn’t get convinced” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the move comes as utilities here and abroad struggle to cope with the changing economics policies and technologies in bringing more renewables into the power mix in germany for instance the large utility rwe squeezed by low prices for conventional fuels recently announced that it planned to split its renewables retail and grid businesses into a separate entityat nrg which operates a large fossilfuelbased fleet that tends to produce steady dividends mr crane became a highprofile proponent of change traveling extensively to gatherings with energy executives and cleanenergy advocates like bill clinton and richard branson and making attentiongetting commitments to reduce the company’s carbon footprintnrg he said would be positioned to take advantage of the shift not only to renewable energy but also away from the traditional monopoly business model to a more decentralized power system newsletter sign up

transition to what he saw as a future where customers would have much more control over the sources and use of their electricityhe bought companies and reorganized nrg into three units nrg business was for conventional wholesale energy enterprises including coal nuclear and gas power plants nrg renew was focused on developing renewable energy sources — including largescale wind and solar farms and microgrids — for commercial customers like businesses or governments and nrg home offered residential customers energy products and services like solar systems and electricvehicle chargingbut as a combination of low oil and gas prices and the threat of rising interest rates led to turbulence in the energy markets and skittishness among renewable energy investors the company pulled back from its ambitionsthe company said it would cut costs reduce debt and spin off the green enterprises into a separate company on a tight leash the new green company which nrg could eventually take public could attract investment from people interested in growth and clean energy who would not ordinarily invest in nrg mr crane said at the timebut the moves were not enough now how things go forward will be up to mr gutierrez  who has been at the company in various roles since  mr crane will assist in the transition through the end of the year nrg said but it declined to make him or mr gutierrez available to commentfor the industry in general said anda ray vice president for environment at the electric power research institute a nonprofit industry group “it’s important to understand your stakeholders your employees your consumers and what is their appetite for the pace and scale of change” advertisement continue reading the main story she added “oftentimes we’re very enamored by the next newest thing at the same time to build that into our everyday lives is actually a significant change” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think
