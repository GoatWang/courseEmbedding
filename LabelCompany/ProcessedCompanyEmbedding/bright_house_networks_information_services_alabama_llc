“limited” is allowed to be abbreviated as “ltd” and “company” may be abbreviated as “co” the name must not state or imply that the llc was formed for some purpose other than that stated in the articles of organization the alabama secretary of state’s office does not reserve names for domestic llcs articles of organization forming your new alabama llc means that you have to file an original and two copies of the llc’s articles of organization with the local county probate judge once the judge finds that the articles are in compliance with state law the judge will issue publish one certified copy of the articles return one to the llc and forward the third within  days to the corporate section of the alabama secretary of state’s office filing requires a  fee payable to the

llc’s organizer if any whether the llc will be membermanaged or managermanaged if managermanaged names and addresses of the managers the rights if any of the members to admit additional members terms and conditions for admission of new members any circumstances under which the resignation of one or more members will require dissolution of the llc any other provisions for the llc’s operation desired to be included by the members registered agent and office all alabama llcs must have designated a registered agent in the statesomeone to receive official state legal and administrative correspondence including if the organization is served with a lawsuit an llc registered agent may be an individual who resides in alabama or a business entity registered to conduct business in the state the registered office may be a place of business for the llc operating agreement the llc’s second most important document is its operating agreement which can be changed by the members as specified in the agreement itself or by state law if the operating agreement or the articles don’t address it having an operating agreement is not legally required by the state but it’s a vitally important internal document that sets forth how the llc will run the operating agreement needs to list the llc’s members how much each one has invested how any profits will be distributed and how much relative weight each member has when voting the operating agreement may also include requirements for meetings notice quorum voting rules etc and similar functions but it doesn’t have to often it can restate or expand upon operating measures already contained in state law it also may include restrictions on the members’ authority to change or repeal the operating agreement or a provision thereof if there is more than one member the operating agreement must initially be unanimously approved in writing membership in the llc alabama llcs must have at least one member each member must be an individual person a member can acquire an interest in the llc when it is formed or by some other method laid out in the operating agreement becoming a member usually requires a contribution of cash or property to the llc or it may take to form of services rendered to the llc however a person may be admitted as a member of the llc without acquiring a membership interest if the articles of organization or operating agreement allow it and all the members agree unless the operating agreement states otherwise a member can withdraw from the llc at any time after giving  days’ written notice to the other members if a member’s withdrawal is in violation of the operating agreement or is due to wrongful conduct by the member that member can be held personally liable for any financial damages caused by the withdrawal from the llc including the cost of paying another person to perform services promised by the withdrawing member ongoing requirements alabama llcs must keep the following types of records available for inspection at their office members’ and managers’ if any names and addresses a copy of the articles of organization with any amendments a copy of the operating agreement along with any amendments copies of federal state and local income tax returns for the past three years financial statements for the llc’s the three most recent years it’s also a good idea to keep copies of the minutes of the various proceedings and committees meetings of the owners or members dissolution an llc is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs events specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement agreement to dissolve by all members event that makes it illegal for the llc to continue when there is no remaining member unless a the holders of all financial rights agree in writing or b the llc’s legal existence and business is continued and one or more new members are appointed judicial decree ordering dissolution taxes an llc by its nature offers some tax advantages over a corporate structure including access to more deductions since the llc is not required to be a separate tax entity like a corporation instead an llc is considered a “passthrough entity” for tax purposes meaning llc owners report business profits and losses on their individual tax returns the alabama tax rate for income from an llc varies based on the amount of alabama taxable

questions for starting a alabama llc how is an llc taxed for federal income tax purposes the profits of an llc limited liability company pass through to the personal income of the membersowners in the case of a single member llc it is taxed the same as a sole proprietorship ie typically filed on the schedule c of the owners personal income tax filing in the case of a multi member member it is taxed the same as a partnership ie a  partnership return is filed with the irs with a schedule k being supplied to each partnermember showing the proportional profitloss allocated to them with this being filed on the schedule c or e note these are general tax explanations and may not apply to everyone you should confer with the appropriate accountingtax specialists to make sure you understand your personal tax liability what is the management structure of an llc an llc is typically managed by its membersowners referred to as membermanaged in that respect an llc is unlike a corporation which has a much more rigid and defined management structure including directors and officers all owners of the llc are typically referred to as members and they can have control and voting interest proportional to their ownership interest or in proportions different from their ownership interest however the members agree are nonus residents allowed to own a corporation of llc there are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a c corporation or an llc the s corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders owner but any us citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder owner you would of course require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process known as the registered agent address but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a c corporation or an llc can i form an llc with just one member there was a time when almost every state required the llc to have two or more members but that is no longer the case this important change came in response to revised irs regulations that clearly permitted singlemember llcs as a result in most states if you plan to be the sole owner of a business and you wish to limit your personal liability you can choose between forming a corporation or an llc what is an operating agreement the operating agreement is akin to a partnership agreement for a general partnership or limited liability partnership llp it is an internal contract amongst the membersowners of the llc and it lays out such things as ownership interest member responsibilities accounting method adding or removing members terms for concluding the llc etc it is generally not required by a given state for forming an llc with the exception of new york although it is certainly recommended when dealing with private companies for financing issues loans mortgages etc it may be required by that company a customizable operating agreement is included with the llccorp kit can another business entity be a member of an llc in the majority of states the members of an llc can be individuals corporations or other llcs these members of the llc can be out of state residents or even foreign nationals furthermore there is no limit to the amount of members that an llc can have the flexibility of an llc in contrast to an s corporation is stark considering the s corporations are limited to  shareholders who must either be united states citizens or lawful permanent residents view all llc faqs included in all of our
