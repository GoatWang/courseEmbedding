wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the monetary standard for the standards of millesimal fineness for the silver alloy used in the manufacture or crafting of silver objects see silver standards the silver standarda is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver the silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the byzantine empire until the th century following the discovery in the th century of large deposits of silver at the cerro rico in potosí bolivia an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the spanish pieces of eight these silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years in  following queen annes proclamation the british west indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the spanish gold doubloon coin in  the master of the royal mint sir isaac newton introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold and this had the effect of putting britain onto a de facto gold standard following the napoleonic wars the united kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in  at the same time revolutions in latin america interrupted the supply of silver dollars pieces of eight that were being produced at the mints in potosi mexico and lima peru the british gold standard initially extended to some of the british colonies including the australasian and southern african colonies but not to its north american colonies british india or to southeast asia the province of canada adopted a gold standard in  as did newfoundland in  in  imperial germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin the united states changed over to gold de facto in the same year and over the next  years all other nations changed to gold leaving only china and the british colonies of hong kong and weihaiwei on the silver standard the silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by china and hong kong in  contents  relative value of silver and gold  bohemia  china  germany  ancient greece  hong kong  india  persia  spain  great britain  united states  see also  notes  references relative value of silver and goldedit since the time that silver was discovered by the spanish in the new world in the th until the latter half of the th century the value of gold in relation to silver maintained a relatively stable ratio of ½ the reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to germanys decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in  on  november  following the defeat of france in the francoprussian war bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity and then proceeded to move germany towards a new gold standard which came about on  july  with the introduction of the gold mark it has also however been suggested by nevada senator john percival jones in  in a speech to the us senate that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the latin monetary union in  jones argues that the latin monetary union involved a partial demonetization of silver silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the th century such that the silver dollar coins of the straits settlements and silver peso coins of the philippines had to be made smaller in size and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value an even larger rise in the price of silver after the first world war caused the royal mint in london to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage but silver never returned to the ½ ratio of the first half of the th century and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold although variable is more of the order of  bohemiaedit beginning in  silver coins were minted at the silver mines at joachimsthal  jáchymov st joachims valley in bohemia now part of the czech republic although formally called guldengroschen they became known as joachimsthalers then shortened to thaler the coins were widely circulated and became the model for silver thalers issued by other european countries the word thaler became dollar in the english language chinaedit china had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange along with the cast copperalloy cash the use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the han dynasty  bc– ad but prior to the song dynasty  those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth during the song dynasty for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after  but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange in the shanyuan treaty signed with the state of liao in  song china agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of  tael of silver and  bolts of silk this was the first time bulk silver in tael chinese  was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a chinese shoe during the yuan dynasty – this became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries the use of silver as money was very established at the time of the ming dynasty – paper money was first issued in  by the founder hongwu emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange but due to the increasing depreciation the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in  st year of the zhengtong emperor meanwhile silver was made much available through foreign trade with the portuguese and the spanish beginning in the th century the great tax reform by the statesman zhang juzheng in  th year of the wanli emperor simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver this can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the ming however the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the americas mainly through the spanish during the qing dynasty – silver ingots were still used but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the southern coastal region through foreign trade since the midqing era it was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars which could be counted easily given their fixed specification and fineness of silver however the qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own it was not until late qing in  that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by guangdong province the coin was at par with the mexican peso and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces for these silver coins the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit as the denomination of the coins were given as  tael specifically  mace and  candareens note for the treaties signed between the qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver except for the treaty of nanking where the silver dollar was indicated see the treaties of tianjin convention of peking treaty of shimonoseki and boxer protocol it was not until  that the yuan chinese  literally roundness was officially announced as the standard monetary unit the yuan was subdivided into  jiao or  fen and specified as  tael of  fineness silver the next year  the socalled great qing silver coin one yuan dollar was issued but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the republic the silver standard was again adopted and codified in  by the newly established republic with one yuan still being equal to  tael of  fineness silver after the chinese nationalist party kuomintang unified the country in  the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in  but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished as one yuan was now equal to  grams of  fineness silver in the same year  while most of the western countries especially britain and usa had left the gold standard because of the great depression it was said that china almost avoided the depression entirely mainly due to having stuck to the silver standardcitation needed however the us silver purchase act of  created an intolerable demand on chinas silver coins and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in september  in favor of the four chinese national banks legal note issues china would be the last to abandon the silver standard along with the british crown colony of hong kong chinas use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank  literally silver house or silver office and for the precious metal and jewel dealer  literally silver building or silver shop germanyedit after its victory in the francoprussian war – germany extracted a huge indemnity from france of £ in gold and used it to join britain on a gold standard germanys abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard ancient greeceedit the first metal used as a currency was silver more than  years ago when silver ingots were used in trade during the heyday of the athenian empire the citys silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve international standard status in mediterranean trade hong kongedit the british colony of hong kong would be the last along with china to abandon the silver standard in september  hong kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the hong kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence s d sterling indiaedit the indian rupee is derived from the rūpaya silver is called rūpa in sanskrit in a silver coin introduced by sher shah suri during his reign from  to  since this is around about the same time that the spanish discovered silver at the cerro rico in potosí the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early s from  the value of silver depreciated relative to gold due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of europe and north america as those countries changed over to the gold standard this had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the rupee following the fowler report india adopted the gold exchange standard in the year  fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence s d sterling persiaedit the dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the persians the caliphates in the islamic world adopted these coins starting with caliph abd almalik – silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the th century spainedit rich deposits of silver in the spanish colonies of the new world allowed spain to mint great quantities of silver coins the spanish dollar was a spanish coin the real de a ocho and later peso worth eight reals hence the nickname pieces of eight which was widely circulated during the th century by the american revolution in  spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the continental congress in addition to the american dollar the real coin became the basis for the chinese yuan great britainedit great britains early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency the pound sterling which traces its origins to before the middle ages see anglosaxon pound when king offa of mercia introduced the silver penny which copied the denarius of charlemagnes frankish empire the early silver pennies were struck from fine silver as pure as was available however in  king henry ii introduced tealby penny english currency was almost exclusively silver until  when the gold noble was put into circulation however silver remained the legal basis for sterling until  in  a new gold coinage was introduced based on the  carat fine guinea fixed in weight at ½ to the troy pound from  this coins value varied considerably until  when it was fixed at  shillings   pounds however this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other european countries british merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold as a consequence silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in leading to a situation where great britain was effectively on a gold standard in  the gold standard was adopted officially with the silver standard reduced to  shillings   pounds rendering silver coins a token issue ie not containing their value

standard based on the spanish milled dollar in  this was codified in the  mint and coinage act and by the federal governments use of the bank of the united states to hold its reserves as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the us dollar this was in effect a derivative silver standard since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency this began a long series of attempts for america to create a bimetallic standard for the us dollar which would continue until the s gold and silver coins were legal tender including the spanish real because of the huge debt taken on by the us federal government to finance the revolutionary war silver coins struck by the government left circulation and in  president jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins the us treasury was put on a strict hard money standard doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the independent treasury act of  which legally separated the accounts of the federal government

traces its origins to before the middle ages see anglosaxon pound when king offa of mercia introduced the silver penny which copied the denarius of charlemagnes frankish empire the early silver pennies were struck from fine silver as pure as was available however in  king henry ii introduced tealby penny english currency was almost exclusively silver until  when the gold noble was put into

value varied considerably until  when it was fixed at  shillings   pounds however this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other european countries british merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold as a consequence silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in leading to a situation where great britain was effectively on a gold

dollar the real coin became the basis for the chinese yuan great britainedit great britains early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency the pound sterling which traces its origins to before the middle ages see anglosaxon pound when king offa of mercia introduced the silver penny which copied the denarius of charlemagnes frankish empire the early silver pennies were struck from fine silver as pure as was available however in  king henry ii introduced tealby penny english currency was almost exclusively silver until  when the gold noble was put into circulation however silver remained the legal basis for sterling until  in  a new gold coinage was introduced based on the  carat fine guinea fixed in weight at ½ to the troy pound from  this coins value varied considerably until  when it was fixed at  shillings   pounds however this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other european countries british merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold as a consequence silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in leading to a situation where great britain was effectively on a gold standard in  the gold standard was adopted officially with the silver standard reduced to  shillings   pounds rendering silver coins a token issue ie not containing their value in precious metal the economic power of great britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit united statesedit the united states adopted a silver standard based on the spanish milled dollar in  this was codified in the  mint and coinage act and by the federal governments use of the bank of the united states to hold its reserves as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the us dollar this was in effect a derivative silver standard since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency this began a long series of attempts for america to create a bimetallic standard for the us dollar which would continue until the s gold and silver coins were legal tender including the spanish real because of the huge debt taken on by the us federal government to finance the revolutionary war silver coins struck by the government left circulation and in  president jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins the us treasury was put on a strict hard money standard doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the independent treasury act of  which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system however the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from england following greshams law silver poured into the us which traded with other silver nations and gold moved out in  the us reduced the silver weight of coins to keep them in circulation and in  removed legal tender status from foreign coinage in  the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began as american banks suspended payment in silver rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks in  the us government suspended payment in gold and silver effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar through the  period various attempts to resurrect bimetallic standards were made including one based on the gold and silver franc however with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits the expectation of scarcity of silver ended the combination that produced economic stability was restriction of supply of new notes a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and indirectly a central bank and a single unit of value as notes devalued or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value or there was a depression governments demanding specie as payment drained the circulating medium out of the economy at the same time there was a dramatically expanded need for credit and large banks were being chartered in various states including those in japan by  the need for stability in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed the coinage act of  enacted by the united states congress in  embraced the gold standard and demonetized silver western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the crime of  for about five years gold was the only metallic standard in the united states until passage of the bland–allison act on february   requiring the us treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins coexistent with gold coins silver certificate series  was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation by acts of congress in  including the gold reserve act and the silver purchase act of  the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time the treasury department was reempowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion thereby divorcing the domestic economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard although international settlements were still in gold this meant that for every ounce of silver in the us treasurys vaults the us government could continue to issue money against it these silver certificates were shredded upon redemption since the redeemed silver was no longer in the treasury with the world market price of silver having been in excess of  per troy ounce since  silver began to flow out of the treasury at an increasing rate to slow the drain president kennedy ordered a halt to issuing  and  silver certificates in  that left the  silver certificate as the only denomination being issued on june   kennedy signed public law  which marked the beginning of the end for even the  silver certificate the law authorized the federal reserve to issue  and  bills and revoked the silver purchase act of  which authorized the secretary of the treasury to issue silver certificates by now limited to the  denomination because it would be several months before the new  federal reserve notes could enter circulation in quantity there was a need to issue silver certificates in the interim because the agricultural adjustment act of  granted the right to issue silver certificates to the president kennedy issued executive order  to delegate that authority to the treasury secretary during the transition silver certificates continued to be issued until late  when the  federal reserve note was released into circulation for several years existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver but this practice was halted on june   finally president richard nixon announced that the united states would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards this announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the nixon shock due to the monetary policy of the us federal reserve calls for a return to the gold standard have returnedcitation needed some states have chosen to use a loophole in the federal

monetary standard for the standards of millesimal fineness for the silver alloy used in the manufacture or crafting of silver objects see silver standards the silver standarda is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver the silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the byzantine empire until the th century following the discovery in the th century of large deposits of silver at the cerro rico in potosí bolivia an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the spanish pieces of eight these silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years in  following queen annes proclamation the british west indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the spanish gold doubloon coin in  the master of the royal mint sir isaac newton introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold and this had the effect of putting britain onto a de facto gold standard following the napoleonic wars the united kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in  at the same time revolutions in latin america interrupted the supply of silver dollars pieces of eight that were being produced at the mints in potosi mexico and lima peru the british gold standard initially extended to some of the british colonies including the australasian and southern african colonies but not to its north american colonies british india or to southeast asia the province of canada adopted a gold standard in  as did newfoundland in  in  imperial germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin the united states changed over to gold de facto in the same year and over the next  years all other nations changed to gold leaving only china and the british colonies of hong kong and weihaiwei on the silver standard the silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by china and hong kong in  contents  relative value of silver and gold  bohemia  china  germany  ancient greece  hong kong  india  persia  spain  great britain  united states  see also  notes  references relative value of silver and goldedit since the time that silver was discovered by the spanish in the new world in the th until the latter half of the th century the value of gold in relation to silver maintained a relatively stable ratio of ½ the reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to germanys decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in  on  november  following the defeat of france in the francoprussian war bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity and then proceeded to move germany towards a new gold standard which came about on  july  with the introduction of the gold mark it has also however been suggested by nevada senator john percival jones in  in a speech to the us senate that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the latin monetary union in  jones argues that the latin monetary union involved a partial demonetization of silver silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the th century such that the silver dollar coins of the straits settlements and silver peso coins of the philippines had to be made smaller in size and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value an even larger rise in the price of silver after the first world war caused the royal mint in london to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage but silver never returned to the ½ ratio of the first half of the th century and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold although variable is more of the order of  bohemiaedit beginning in  silver coins were minted at the silver mines at joachimsthal  jáchymov st joachims valley in bohemia now part of the czech republic although formally called guldengroschen they became known as joachimsthalers then shortened to thaler the coins were widely circulated and became the model for silver thalers issued by other european countries the word thaler became dollar in the english language chinaedit china had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange along with the cast copperalloy cash the use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the han dynasty  bc– ad but prior to the song dynasty  those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth during the song dynasty for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after  but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange in the shanyuan treaty signed with the state of liao in  song china agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of  tael of silver and  bolts of silk this was the first time bulk silver in tael chinese  was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a chinese shoe during the yuan dynasty – this became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries the use of silver as money was very established at the time of the ming dynasty – paper money was first issued in  by the founder hongwu emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange but due to the increasing depreciation the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in  st year of the zhengtong emperor meanwhile silver was made much available through foreign trade with the portuguese and the spanish beginning in the th century the great tax reform by the statesman zhang juzheng in  th year of the wanli emperor simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver this can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the ming however the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the americas mainly through the spanish during the qing dynasty – silver ingots were still used but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the southern coastal region through foreign trade since the midqing era it was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars which could be counted easily given their fixed specification and fineness of silver however the qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own it was not until late qing in  that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by guangdong province the coin was at par with the mexican peso and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces for these silver coins the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit as the denomination of the coins were given as  tael specifically  mace and  candareens note for the treaties signed between the qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver except for the treaty of nanking where the silver dollar was indicated see the treaties of tianjin convention of peking treaty of shimonoseki and boxer protocol it was not until  that the yuan chinese  literally roundness was officially announced as the standard monetary unit the yuan was subdivided into  jiao or  fen and specified as  tael of  fineness silver the next year  the socalled great qing silver coin one yuan dollar was issued but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the republic the silver standard was again adopted and codified in  by the newly established republic with one yuan still being equal to  tael of  fineness silver after the chinese nationalist party kuomintang unified the country in  the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in  but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished as one yuan was now equal to  grams of  fineness silver in the same year  while most of the western countries especially britain and usa had left the gold standard because of the great depression it was said that china almost avoided the depression entirely mainly due to having stuck to the silver standardcitation needed however the us silver purchase act of  created an intolerable demand on chinas silver coins and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in september  in favor of the four chinese national banks legal note issues china would be the last to abandon the silver standard along with the british crown colony of hong kong chinas use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank  literally silver house or silver office and for the precious metal and jewel dealer  literally silver building or silver shop germanyedit after its victory in the francoprussian war – germany extracted a huge indemnity from france of £ in gold and used it to join britain on a gold standard germanys abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard ancient greeceedit the first metal used as a currency was silver more than  years ago when silver ingots were used in trade during the heyday of the athenian empire the citys silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve international standard status in mediterranean trade hong kongedit the british colony of hong kong would be the last along with china to abandon the silver standard in september  hong kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the hong kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence s d sterling indiaedit the indian rupee is derived from the rūpaya silver is called rūpa in sanskrit in a silver coin introduced by sher shah suri during his reign from  to  since this is around about the same time that the spanish discovered silver at the cerro rico in potosí the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early s from  the value of silver depreciated relative to gold due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of europe and north america as those countries changed over to the gold standard this had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the rupee following the fowler report india adopted the gold exchange standard in the year  fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence s d sterling persiaedit the dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the persians the caliphates in the islamic world adopted these coins starting with caliph abd almalik – silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the th century spainedit rich deposits of silver in the spanish colonies of the new world allowed spain to mint great quantities of silver

miner silver standard resources focused on little things and achieved impressively big results reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer apr   at am silver and gold miner silver standard resources inc nasdaqssri reacted to the commodity downturn like most in the precious metals industry  it cut costs the overall performance of the company is pretty impressive on this front too however its the little things that added up to big savings heres a quick analysis of what silver standard did right at one of its key mines the big picture between  and  silver standard was able to reduce its cash costs per gold equivalent ounce from  to  thats an impressive  decrease in the underlying cost of operating its mines this is the biggest piece of allin sustaining costs a broader measure that includes the capital spending needed to sustain production for example silver standards allin sustaining costs at its marigold mine were up  year over year in  partly because of the construction of a new leach pad cash costs meanwhile were roughly  lower image source silver standard resources inc so cash costs can give you a good idea of how efficiently a miner is running its mines but its important to remember that cash costs are a toplevel number theres a lot that goes on underneath that figure this is why its worth looking at some of the little things that silver standard has been doing to see how theyve added up to a  difference between  and  the minutiae one of the little changes that silver standard implemented is known as a hot shift change that sounds a lot more exciting than it really is but it helped the company reduce its hauling costs by  between  and  at its marigold mine what used to happen during a shift change was that drivers would turn off their vehicles with the thought that it would reduce wear and tear on the engines and save fuel however engine technology has advanced notably and now the trucks are left running while the shifts change this ultimately reduces equipment downtime and thus increases productivity leaving trucks running sounds like a silly thing but the savings clearly add up another notable change was the decision to reduce the number of drills the company used at marigold from six to four with less gear silver standard was forced to use its remaining drills more efficiently effectively getting more out of each machine the impact was a  reduction in the cost per foot drilled silver standards costs have been moving steadily lower helping improve margins as preciousmetals prices head higher image source silver standard resources inc silver standard also changed its blasting patterns blasting products and loading sequence at marigold how things work together at a mine is a giant jigsaw puzzle you or i might view it as a logistical nightmare trying to figure out what needs to be where and when but moving the pieces around a little helped the miner trim its blasting costs by  between  and  an outsider might not even notice the logistics change but it obviously led to impressive results the last interesting change involved transferring the skills of a key employee to peers the company asked the most effective shovel operator at marigold to help train the other shovel operators sharing best practices it was another small change but one that led to a  drop in the ropeshovel cost per tonne as the trainees adopted the new techniques theyd been shown marigolds ropeshovel crew is a top industry performer image source silver standard resources inc under the hood mine costs ebb and flow for many reasons including the age of a mine and the shifting geology of a site as material is dug up so it wouldnt be surprising to see mine costs go up at silver standard in the future but its really easy to take bigpicture numbers like cash costs and forget all the work thats going on beneath indeed little things like hot shift changes and sharing best practices can really start to add up even though they are easy to miss thats a mistake because small changes like these highlight the focus silver standard has made on ensuring its operations run lean and mean but the best part is that many of the changes noted here will have a lingering impact even if other pieces of the mining puzzle push costs up for a spell in fact next time you see bigpicture numbers like cash costs and allin sustaining costs dont just move on to the next factoid take a moment to read and understand whats driving the figure up or down it could be more material than you think reuben brewer has no position in any

silver standard made a key acquisition in  to boost its production outlook but only if it pans out as planned reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer apr   at am precious metals miner silver standard resources inc nasdaqssri made a bold move in  to solidify its future indeed a single acquisition materially improved the gold and silver companys longterm outlook and at an important time however if first quarter production numbers are any indication silver standard has a lot riding on its new mine and thats something that shareholders should be worried about the bee in the sea silver standards big acquisition in  was the purchase of claude resources the roughly  million deal added claudes seabee and santoy mines in canada to silver standards core assets bringing the miner up to three working mines the new mines were desirable because of their relatively low costs and high grade operations claudes low debt and cash balance also led to to an improvement in silver standards financial profile   image source silver standard resources inc it was a pretty good deal all around and silver standard quickly worked to make it even better by signing a deal with eagle plains resources to explore land contiguous with silver standards new seabee property this is perhaps the more telling transaction because it hints at the growth potential that the claude transaction offers in the nick of time but heres the thing silver standards other mines arent exactly hitting it out of the park production wise for example in  the marigold mine saw gold production decline nearly  and the pirquitas mine saw silver production increase by a little under  not much to write home about if you are looking to invest in a miner thats growing its business     the seabee mine  image source silver standard resources inc and the numbers arent expected to get better in  for example marigolds gold production is expected to be flat to up around  that said marigolds first quarter production was down nearly  year over year  not an auspicious start but that was a lot better than the roughly  silver production decline at pirquitas that said silver standard just inked a deal to expand its exploration opportunities at pirquitas that should lead to a production pickup from those dismal numbers but the main point doesnt change these two mines arent growth engines   which is why investors should be worried essentially silver standard has bet a lot of its future on the seabee mine because it only owned the mine for part of the year in  seabee produced just  ounces of gold for silver standard its expecting fullyear production of  to  ounces in    the seabee mine at a glance  image source silver standard resources inc so theres a nice bump right there but it gets better seabee produced roughly  more gold in the first quarter than it did in the fourth quarter that led ceo paul benson to note that our production of  gold equivalent ounces is a strong start to the year highlighted by seabee continuing to demonstrate a capability to produce above historical levels those kind of results are going to be needed on an ongoing basis if silver standard hopes to keep production growing not the end of the world the big takeaway here isnt that silver standard resources is in some dire danger the deal to extend the mine life of pirquitas is a clear demonstration that there are other avenues available to the miner to support growth however it still has a lot riding on the seabee mine and that means investors need to watch the progress at that mine very carefully if something goes wrong or the expansion opportunities there prove less than compelling youll have something really notable to start worrying about reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned

result of a successful month operational excellence project ore milled in the fourth quarter of  contained an average silver grade of  gt  lower than the  gt reported in the third quarter as the availability of ore in the lower benches of the san miguel open pit was reduced resulting in medium grade stockpile ore supplementing mill feed the average silver recovery in the fourth quarter was

equivalent figures are based on a  per ounce gold price and a  per ounce silver price    marigold production is expected to increase compared to  as the mine benefits from the gold ounces stacked on the leach pads through the latter months of  and from continued strong performance in  as a result production is expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year capital expenditures total  million and are primarily attributable to mining equipment components of  million and replacement of support equipment of  million with  million allocated for permitting capitalized stripping is expected to decline significantly relative to  as mining focuses on the current phases of the mackay pit approximately  million of capitalized stripping are expected to be incurred in the second half of the year as we commence stripping of the next phase of the mackay pit despite the decline in mining costs capitalized cash costs per payable ounce are expected to be similar to  at the seabee gold operation  will mark our first full year of ownership with production expected to remain near record levels of between  and  ounces of gold at low cash costs based on mill throughput of  tonnes per day annual production is expected to be weighted toward the second half of the year as mine grade is expected to increase as additional levels are developed at the santoy mine complex through early  capital investments at seabee of  million include  million for improvement of gravity recovery in the plant  million for ventilation improvements to the santoy mine complex to support a higher mining rate and  million for a water treatment plant related to tailings water discharge capitalized development of  million is principally for santoy decline development and to establish stations for underground definition and exploration drilling at the pirquitas mine as previously disclosed mining of the san miguel open pit is expected to cease in january  medium grade stockpiles are expected to constitute the mill feed upon cessation of open pit mining activities as a result silver production is expected to decline and cash costs are expected to be higher in  compared to  zinc production is not expected in  due to lower zinc grades in the stockpiled material as we report cash costs on a per payable ounce sold basis  expected cash costs include stockpile inventory costs of approximately  per ounce of silver that were previously incurred capital expenditures include approximately  million for completion of the tailings facility lift which commenced in the fourth quarter of  and is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of  the remaining sustaining capital is for maintaining the rehandle fleet and the mill in fully operational condition  further we expect to incur approximately  million related to remediation of mining areas in  mainly on surface water control measures the pirquitas plant is expected to operate through  conditional upon profitable processing of stockpiles at prevailing market conditions and to close in late  or early  subject to our investment decision on the chinchillas project we continue to evaluate our right to exercise our option to
