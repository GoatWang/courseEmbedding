administration cincinnati district officecentral region steger drivecincinnati oh telephone  fax   september   ms cheryl krueger presidentownerlife support development ltd fisher roadcolumbus oh  warning lettercin dear ms krueger the us food  drug administration fda conducted an inspection at your dietary supplement manufacturer and distributor life support development ltd located at  fisher road columbus oh on december    and   in addition we reviewed your product label collected during the inspection we also reviewed  your website at httpslifesupportcom in september  and determined that you take orders there for the product life support hangover relief   based on our inspection and subsequent review of your product labeling collected during the inspection as well as your firms website we found serious violations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act and applicable regulations you may find the act and the fda’s regulations through links on fda’s home page at wwwfdagov unapproved new drug we also have determined that life support hangover relief product is being promoted for conditions that cause the product to be a drug under section gb of the act  usc § gb the therapeutic claims in your product labeling establish that the products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease  examples of claims that provide evidence that your life support hangover relief product is intended for use as a drug include“hangover relief”“tired of hangovers life support’s cuttingedge formula contains an extract from the fruit of the japanese raisin tree known specifically to aid in the recovery from alcohol intoxication”website “life support can protect the liver and brain from damage …” your life support hangover relief product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and therefore the products are “new drugs” under section p of the act  usc § p new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from fda as described in section a of the act  usc § a see also section d of the act  usc § d fda approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective adulterated dietary supplement   even if your life support hangover relief product was not an unapproved new drug it would still be an adulterated dietary supplement under section g of the act the inspection revealed significant violations of the cgmp requirements for dietary supplements these violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated under section g of the act  usc§ g in that they have been prepared packed or held under conditions which do not meet the current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations for dietary supplements title  code of federal regulations part   cfr part  specifically our investigator observed the following significant violations     your firm failed to establish the following specifications as required by  cfr  a    identity specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement  cfr b specifically your employee stated that your firm did not have specifications for incoming componentsb    product specifications for the identity purity and strength of the finished batch of the dietary supplement and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement  cfr e specifically your life support ingredient breakdown that you provided to our investigator as documentation of product specifications does not contain specifications for the identity purity and strength of the finished batch of the dietary supplement or limits on any contaminants     you failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record mmr for each unique formulation of dietary supplement you manufacture and for each batch size to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch in the manner required by  cfr  though you informed our investigator that you did not have a mmr there is evidence to suggest that you maintain documents that contain elements of an mmr however your mmr does not contain all the required elements specifically a    the strength concentration weight or measure of each dietary ingredient for each batch size  cfr ab    an accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used  cfr cc    a statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point step or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made  cfr fd    a representative label or a crossreference to the physical location of the actual or representative label  cfr ge    written instructions including specifications for each point step or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the mmr  cfr hf    written procedures for sampling in the mmr and a cross reference to procedures for tests or examinations  cfr h     your firm failed to follow written procedures for manufacturing operations as required by  cfr  specifically your employee provided the investigator with your “production procedure outline” as documentation of your manufacturing operations however according to your employee the procedure is not followed as some steps have changed andor been omitted from production     your firm failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of your quality control operations including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing as required by  cfr  specifically your employee indicated to our investigator that no written procedures exist for your quality control operations further as a manufacturer and distributor that contracts with other entities to label packaging that your firm uses to package dietary supplements that are then distributed under your firm’s name your firm has an obligation to know what and how labeling activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether your dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution  fed reg   jun   your firm introduces or delivers or causes the introduction or delivery of dietary supplement products into interstate commerce in their final form for distribution to consumers as such your firm has an overarching and ultimate responsibility to ensure that all phases of the production of that product are in compliance with dietary supplement cgmp requirements although your firm may contract out certain operations it cannot by the same token contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplements it places into commerce or causes to be placed into commerce are not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements  see united states v dotterweich  us    explaining that an offense can be committed under the act by anyone who has a “responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws” united states v park  us    holding that criminal liability under the act does not turn on awareness of wrongdoing and that “agents vested with the responsibility and power commensurate with that responsibility to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with the act” can be held accountable for violations of the act in particular the act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction or causing the delivery or introduction into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section g for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements  usc §§ g a thus a firm that contracts with other firms to conduct certain dietary supplement manufacturing packaging or labeling operations for it is responsible for ensuring that the dietary supplement is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements regardless of who actually performs the dietary supplement cgmp operations your firm must establish a system of production and process controls and implement quality control operations to ensure the quality of your dietary supplements and that the dietary supplements are packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record  cfr  and  you firm must establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations  cfr  the quality control personnel must ensure that your manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record  cfr  further you must have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval of release for any packaged and labeled dietary supplement  cfr h and b      your firm failed to collect and hold reserve samples of each lot of packaged and labeled dietary supplements that you distribute as required by  cfr a specifically according to your employee your firm did not collect and hold reserve samples for production lots   and     your batch production records bprs do not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch as required by  cfr b specifically we reviewed your bprs for batches pr pr pr and pr of your life support hangover relief supplement these bpr’s do not include the following information that is required by  cfr  a    the identity of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch  cfr bb    the date and time of the maintenance cleaning and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch or a crossreference to records such as individual equipment logs where this information is retained  cfr cc    the unique identifier that you assigned to each component and packaging used  cfr dd    a statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing  cfr fe    the actual results obtained during any monitoring operations  cfr gf    the results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production or a crossreference to such results  cfr hg    documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with e and with respect to packaging g  cfr ih    documentation at the time of performance of the manufacturing of the batch including the initials of the person performing each step the initials of the person responsible for weighing or measuring each component used in the batch the initials of the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure of each component used in the batch the initials of the person responsible for adding the component to the batch and the initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of components to the batch  cfr ji    documentation at the time of performance of packaging operations including the unique identifier that you assigned to packaging used the quantity of the packaging used an actual representative label or a crossreference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the master manufacturing record and the results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements or a crossreference to the physical location of such results  cfr kj    documentation at the time of performance that the quality control reviewed the bpr approved or rejected any reprocessing or repackaging approved and released or rejected the batch for distribution including any reprocessed batch and approved and released or rejected the packaged and labeled dietary supplement including any repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement  cfr l additionally you failed to prepare a bpr every time you manufacture a batch of dietary supplement as required by a specifically according to your employee a bpr was not prepared for batch pr     your firm failed to establish written procedures to

determine whether the packaging conform to the master manufacturing record  cfr c you must also implement a system to determine the complete manufacturing history and control of a packaged and labeled dietary supplement through distribution  cfr d     your firm failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations as required by  cfr  specifically during the inspection your employee indicated to our investigator that no written procedures exist at your facility for holding and distributing operations additionally your firm does not routinely maintain distribution records for your finished products distributed as required by  cfr a     your firm failed to establish written procedures for personnel qualification requirements as required by  cfr  specifically your employee stated that the firm does not have procedures to ensure employees are qualified to conduct job functions once you have established written procedures you must make and keep documentation of personnel training including the date of the training the type of training and the persons trained as required under  cfr b specifically you told our investigator that your employees

posted feb   at  am last updated feb   at  am life support is a cleverly named product that is designed to be a hangover relief product the key component of this product  and what the manufacturer would like you to believe sets it apart from competing products  is a unique ingredient called japanese raisin tree fruit extract while this isn’t the first time this ingredient has been marketed as a hangover relief supplement it’s the first time we’ve seen it appear in liquid shot form the  oz sugar sweetened formula is quite pleasant tasting especially compared with some of the other artificially sweetened shots that we’ve tried still it’s a functional product at hard so there’s definitely some bite to it and an aftertaste on the functional front it also includes vitamin c b vitamins taurine amino acids and a few other ingredients like other drinks in the category it’s difficult if not impossible to tell you how it performs relative to other products from the visual perspective the glass bottle has a clean and polished look the “life support” brand is simple and appealing especially since they’ve kept the word “hangover” to small lettering thus reducing any social stigma that you might have from consuming a drink like this in public branding aside this is still a niche product with a specific use occasion that is at least for most people a much less frequent one than something like energy so it’s hard to say just how big a brand like this can get the choice of glass packaging is a nice point of differentiation it enhances the overall presence of the product since the graphics pop better from the bottle being painted instead of the shrink sleeve labels that go on the standard shot bottles and it’s easier to drink from overall life support is a nicely executed product albeit one that still faces the same challenges as other hangover drinks comments beverage industry jobs field market manager  the saint louis breweryschlafly beer east bay
