earnings report from netflix trading activity was light throughout most of the week despite a heavy earnings calendar  roughly onefifth of companies in the sp  index have released secondquarter earnings so far and the pace of earnings growth is running ahead of expectations  according to factset the “blended” earnings growth stands at  compared with analyst’s expectations of  when reporting began  “blended” earnings is a combination of actual earnings for those companies who have reported together with the latest estimated earnings for those companies who have yet to report  earnings strength has been a driver of the market’s gains so far this year helping to counteract some of the high pricetoearnings ratios that have plagued the market over the past few years strength in the global economy along with hopes for improved growth in the us has also been a factor driving gains the previous week brought disappointing news on this front with the release of soft us inflation and retail sales data but this week’s data is somewhat more encouraging  in particular housing starts rose  in june and permits for future construction rose   weekly initial claims for unemployment benefits fell  to  signaling continued strength in the labor market a midweek rally in oil prices helped energy stocks the upcoming week will be one of the heaviest of this earnings season and based on what we’ve seen so far we are expecting the market to react favorably  tech stocks are in focus with google amazon and facebook all reporting over the course of the week for the week the dow jones

been rising dramatically in recent years leading many college students to graduate with the enormous burden of massive loans as a percentage of household debt student debt has climbed to  that’s an increase of more than three times in just  years careful planning can mitigate this alarming trend thanks to nearly four decades of experience in education planning we can offer you intelligent options and help you choose the right vehicle for your education account we’ll take the time to consider your family’s educational funding needs available assets and time horizon and develop a unique plan for you using one or more of the following options  plan to set up a college savings account we recommend a  plan but we encourage parents to research the options available to them within the plan most states offer plans with agebased allocation options but the administration options vary from state to state and not all plans offer a guaranteed rate of return the advantage of a  plan is that the money grows tax free it is “qualified” for educational purposes in most cases this means tuition room board books travel and school supplies most of these plans have very low minimum contributions assets from a  plan are protected from bankruptcy educational savings account coverdell another option for those investors who want a little more control over their account is an educational savings account the benefits of this account depend entirely on the income levels of the contributor for anyone seeking financial aid however colleges consider assets in one of these accounts the student’s and not the parents’ which reduces the student’s eligibility for aid there is an annual contribution limit of  per beneficiary and parents who exceed income limits are not permitted to make contributions the money in the account grows tax free and withdrawals for educational purposes are taxfree up to a limit determined by the beneficiary’s qualified status income level roth ira a third excellent option again depending upon your income levels is to set up a roth ira account for educational purposes which will not affect the student’s ability to receive financial aid these accounts offer a wider range of investment options and parents or grandparents can contribute up to  annually  if aged  or over to a roth ira a child working for his or her parents also can set up a roth ira contributions are not taxdeductible but the investments grow tax deferred and are tax free when taken out these withdrawals can be used to fund a child or grandchild’s education if not needed contributors are that much more prepared for retirement at winch financial we advocate education for personal growth and expanded horizons and understand that a comprehensive and conscientious discussion of your options will help you reach your goals  we look forward to assisting you with strategic education planning financial planningthe da vinci code for crafting a legacyjuly  happy high
