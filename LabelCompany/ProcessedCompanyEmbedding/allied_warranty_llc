centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than

the onepage contract three lawyers i showed it to laughed they said it is one page because it is so vague that it doesnt require allied to do anything when you have a problem you will call allied how warranty because you think you have a warranty with them and will get some sort of benefit over calling someone else wrong allied will send our their own contractor the name on the truck isnt allied but they are owned by the same person andrew white the contractor will come out for a  fee you would pay about that if you picked someone at random you arent getting a special price for that  allieds contractor wont actually do any work but they will overquote the cost of repairs by as much as three times the actual cost then they will tell you that you get a small token credit toward the repair but only if you use their contractor to do the work so if your water heater breaks they may tell you it will be  to replace it but they will give you a  credit because of your warranty you could have hired your own repairman to do the whole job for  but allied will not allow this of you want the  credit so  for allied to do the work or  to just have it done yourself the bbb wouldnt even accept my complaint against allied the bbb gives them an a rating in part because of the low number of complaints they get the bbb doesnt like to rate its members low because it hurts their business model

beware i have recently purchased a new home and received one year of home warranty from allied so far we have made three service requests for  a piece long story short for the first two was that the items needing repair were to far gone but they would be happy to sell us new systems furnace and hot water heater the third is the worst yet the refrigerator that came with the house failed a claim was filed and a technician sent for  of course the technician looked it over and couldnt do the repairs then but had to go back to get approval to do the repairs because he thought it was on the boarder of repair vs getting a payout for the fridgehe said we would get a call back that afternoon after not hearing anything for a couple days i called allied to inquire on the process and was told that the repair request was approved and they were trying to get a hold of the service technician to schedule the repairs allied would call back me that evening to follow up no call back a couple of days pass by and i call to inquire again about the progress of the claim im told that the claim is delayed because they can not contact the service technician but the operator im speaking with will get ahold of the technician and personally get back to me that evening no call i call yet again with the same expected responsewe can t get a hold of the technician two weeks after my initial call i am contacted but not about the repairs but a request for a copy of my home inspection i sent it in and there is no indication of any deficiencies with the refrigerator i hear nothing a few days later i call to inquire about the claim and im told that the claim has been declined they claimed that it was a pre existing condition and not covered how an item in a home that i have just purchased has a pre existing condition is beyond me especially since it was not discovered on the home inspection but what really gets me is that it took them three weeks to inform me that they wont fix it even though i was told earlier that it would be now after being without a fridge for three weeks with a newborn at home forgot to mention that that made it even more fun we get to go get a new fridge out of pocket thanks for nothing allied it really appears that allied is really just a front for their affiliate nrg to sell installation and service of new overpriced systems and appliances i will be

finish repairs why would my home warranty company even have this vendor as an option anyways when i call allied all they tell me is they are letting the appropriate departments know about whats going on ive asked for followups and calls back and have never gotten one from stephanie whom seems to answer the phone every time i call i also asked to speak with a manager and have yet to receive a call back from her tara if i didnt call everyone every other day then i would never get my items repaired horrible customer service no returned callsfollowups poor choice of vendors inability to get a

received hsa from the seller for free when i purchased a house so far i had to call them for a hot water tank issue and furnace issue the hot water tank after a couple visits and part replacements eventually got replaced with a bran new one the plumber gave great service and was prompt and i had no issues with his service or hsas service the furnace was the same way it ended up being an easy fix but still the service was great on by both hsa and the repair tech even if i would have paid for the hsa warranty it would have paid for itself in a few months i definitely recommend it for anyone buying a new house as for someone who is really handy or has been in their house for a while it really depends on the shape of your appliances the warranty is a little pricey to have everything properly covered but it definitely helps when something unexpected happens joseph reyes  oh    i have had nothing but the best experience with our hsa home warranty buying a home is stressful enough but having the peace of mind knowing that problems can be fixed is priceless yes customer service can be tough to get on the phone it is very frustrating but once on the phone they are professional and very easy to deal with they are also very responsive in giving updates on repairs once in progress the website portal to start a repair is effortless and is the easiest way to go we have never had an issue getting our repairs completed or having competent individuals complete the work in todays world everyone wants their issues fixed instantaneously but the reality is sometimes it takes time as long as you are cognizant that things break at the most inopportune time and you have to take a deep breath and go through the process you will be fine all of our service provider have been professional and exception in their repair process i will continue to renew our policy for as long as hsa will allow vicki  mo    our air conditioner quit on a saturday morning and i called hsa by

has almost always been super pleasant they are very friendly and easy to discuss issues with angus macmillan  ut    after having but never using this warranty for alomst a year i had a regrigerator and swamp cooler go out in the same weekno problem i thought i have this home warranty the seller included in the price of the home unable to reach anyone by phone or email after many attempts i finally opened an online service request the next day i was contacted by a refrigerator repair company telling me the soonest they could get out was a week from today that was not acceptable so i tried calling landmark at least  times waiting on hold for ever opened up a chat window from their website which remained inactive for a full  minutes and sent them emails from both their website and directly with zero response i did not hear from anyone except to receive an email that they had charged my credit card  for the fridge repair order it was not until i threatened to give them a poor review that i got a somehwat personally directed email to cut a long story short i ended up cancelling both service tickets and booked service myself with people coming out in two days vs a week in both cases the service fees for the onsite calls were less than the  deductible from landmark and both fees would credit against any repair cost in closing i am not sure that anyone actually works at landmark other than in their web team i think the company is a shell and like the wizard of oz with has a few short wizards pulling knobs and dials behind a large landmark home warranty web curtain my adviceput   month in the bank for repairs and forget about buying landmark home warranty erica schaefer  tx    once i placed the service request i received a call regarding my request within  minutes it was july th the next morning the service technician was out and everything was fixed easy questions to answer great customer service jocelyn durant  tx    i have had landmark since april i have since had to use them twice the first to have the house rekeyed and had the most amazing service from landmark and the service provider the second service request for was the dishwasher which stopped working which we discovered after closing landmark provided excellent customer service throughout this process with prompt follow up efforts to find and locate parts and contacting the service provider when needed they were able to solve my challenge with a pay out i have been extremely satisfied with landmark warranty and would highly recommend them to others heather  tx    this is the second home we have warrantied thru landmark our experiences have always been positive most of our claims have been appliance repairs fridge and washing machine some of the contractors have been better than others but all seemed adequate and several were outstanding if there have been delays in repairs it is typically because a part had to be ordered or because the issue occurred on the weekend when contractor was not working you cannot fault the warranty company or even contractor for that my thought is that if im able to get what would otherwise be an expensive out of pocket repair completed for a minimal charge and a few days wait then im getting what i paid for i have been pleased with the polite and helpful staff at landmark when ive placed calls about a service request if everything continues as it has thus far i expect to continue doing business with landmark for years to come  home warranty  add to compare call now for a free quote  rating premium  deductible

section they are always really friendly  even when i have called in all aggravated and flustered that my air conditioning stopped working i got a call from the ac repair man about  minutes after i hung up with claims i thought about giving them  stars instead of  because the repair man couldnt fix the issue on the spot when he came out because he had to order a part  then i thought to myself that to hold that against them would be pretty unreasonable so based on my experience i rate them  out  stars and i highly recommend them if you are looking for a home warranty company joan h  tx

an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions
