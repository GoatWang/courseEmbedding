everyone joining us today as highlighted in our press release today i am pleased with our execution in the first quarter with the revenue at high end upper guidance operating expenses below guidance where it was below guidance enabling us to be well on track to achieve our target at ebitda breakeven and by middle of the year entering the second quarter were excited to see a strong backlog and bookings in our business driven by design wins that are ramping into production across our customer base additionally we had another strong quarter of new design wins in which we secured over  design wins totaling an annual revenue runway potential of  million of course assuming design wins reaching full production and its always subject to market conditions this continued momentum of new opportunities should help to secure our expected growth in the second half of  and into  from an end market perspective approximately  of the design wins were secured in the industrial market while consumer markets represented approximately  of the wins notable design wins included a high volume smart lighting application as well as wins for communication modules in personal computing devices and a highvolume smartphone application i had also indicated previously that we started an initiative to focus on large tier  odms to secure highvolume revenue opportunities for our products and im happy to indicate that in q  we secured design wins with several such customers in computing and communication end markets these customers are utilizing multiple adesto products across different applications demonstrating the increasing content and the breath of opportunities we have across our client base as a direct result of our focus on diversifying and expanding our customer base over twothirds of the design wins in the first quarter with new customers another key initiative for us has been to further diversify our business beyond our stronghold in the industrial market into markets where the duration from design win to production shorter and represents higher volume opportunities in the first quarter we had success along these lines as well of the top  design wins secured in the first quarter ranked by annual dollar value approximately half are in consumer market and the other half in computing one of our biggest assets is our large and top tier customer base we supply our customers in a variety of ways including direct through distribution fulfillment houses and through contract manufacturers hence as i indicated previously its not a trivial task to trace accurately design win conversion wins into production the last several quarters we have put forth efforts to identify cases where we can clearly track design wins through the channel and into mass production with the end customers and id like to share this data with you looking at the design wins in  that could be traced clearly in the channel and into production we can say that approximately twothirds of them have started to ramp into production some are early in their production and some have ramped as expected as we progress through the year additional design wins was also beginning ramping into production layering onto this growing pipeline of revenue generating designs this is encouraging as it validates our investment and focus on expanding our base to support our growth profile as evidenced by our expectations for the second quarter in terms of our top  revenue customers in the first quarter the revenue breakdown by end market consisted of  from industrial market  from consumer market and the remaining  is spread across communication medical automotive and computing examples of applications that are currently in volume production at these customers includes smart meters as our largest customer universal remotes personal tracking devices streaming tv and media player and many others with that let me take a few minutes to talk about some of our product families in more detail in the first quarter we taped out our nm version of our mb dataflash family this is a follow up tape out at nanometer as we taped out at mb dataflash last year as we communicated to you this is a cost reduction initiative for our dataflash family we will be sampling these products with our leading industrial customers for the rest of the year and into  also during the quarter we continue to make progress sampling our at dataflash products that are designed specifically for the asia smart meter market as ive mentioned previously this is product family that offers limited feature set alternative targeting china smart meter customers and is more suitable for the costconscious metering and industrial markets such as the ones in china we continue to monitor market demand for dataflash to see the need for densities beyond  and mb at advance notes and will roll out those efforts into our planning when appropriate we have close working relationships with our metering and industrial customers and always align our development efforts with our partners product roadmaps turning to our fusion family we continue to generate increasing revenue and interest for this product as i mentioned last quarter this product family had experienced a rapid ramping shipments becoming one of our fasted growing lines as many of you know our existing portfolio are fusion flash products range from kb to mb in order to expand these offerings we have focused our development efforts on additional densities starting with mb mb and mb which we expect to tape out in the fourth quarter we expect to sample these additional densities in mid looking at our ecoxip product family we also continue to make solid progress on our development and sampling activities engineering samples of our mb device have been provided to our early customers and partners the broader rollup of this product will occur in the fourth quarter and in  we have started design activity of mb ecoxip and expect to tape out this product this quarter the mb version of the ecoxip will be taped out later this year by mid we believe we should have mb mb and mb versions of the ecoxip in various levels of silicon sampling and hopefully in production with some of our early partners our ecoxip products can be deployed in many types of iot and embedded devices including wearables medical monitors pos controllers sensors and beacons leading mcu and systemonchip customers such as nxpqualcomm are among the early designing customers industry leaders believe that as soc and mcus move to nm and below embedding nonvolatile memory functionality becomes extremely expensive ecoxip offers an ideal solution for such cases where performance cost and power characteristics of an ecoxip device as a systeminpackage becomes an attractive alternative to todays solutions last quarter we also tapedout a version of our mavriq family designed for the camera module per plan this is kb serial nonvolatile memory device thats ideally suited for this growing market we believe this is a very large market opportunity for adesto and well be actively engaged with customers and contract manufacturers to assess their specific needs while also furthering seeding the market this opportunity becomes even more attractive as the density requirements increase in the coming years because the mavriq platformbase devices are more cost effective than alternative eeprom which are used today we continue to work toward securing design wins for this application and expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarters lastly in terms of standard serial flash product family we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various highvolume opportunities for notebooks and tablets as well as consumer end markets during the first quarter we secured notable design wins for highvolume smart lighting applications with a leading soc company this particular design win is ramping into production this year we have also secured design wins in a wearables application with a global navigation and variable technology company as many of you recall we began increasing our investment activity around this product group in the third quarter of  as an extension of our strategy to pursue higher unit volumes and faster ramping opportunities to further diversify our customer base and revenue since that time we have made notable progress with customers as well as expansion of our product offerings across densities these products have helped drive additional revenue opportunities near term as the result of the shorter design cycles by also broadening our footprint with customers as i mentioned last quarter we anticipate revenue contribution from these products to approach approximately  exiting the year which will represents a significant underlying growth rate for this time in summary we look to the second quarter the combination of design wins ramping into production and continued traction with new products is driving our expectation for strong growth with revenue projected to grow  yearoveryear entering q we have record bookings and backlogs and were seeing this trend continue as we progress through the quarter this sets the stage for continued momentum across our end markets and product families in the second half of this year with that i will now turn the call over to ron to review the first quarter financial results in more detail as well as more details on our second quarter outlook ron ron shelton thanks narbeh and thanks everyone for joining today revenue in the first quarter ended march   was  million and that was at the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of approximately  from the  million in the first quarter of last year and it was down seasonally  from  million last quarter gross margin in the first quarter was  as compared to  in the first quarter of  and  last quarter gross margins continue to remain at the high end of our long term model and reflect the fact that the market continues to embrace the value added differentiated solutions we provide the slight decline sequentially in gross margin was due to primary to product mix and the impacted of fixed costs on a lower revenue base we continue to expect gross margins to remain near  but on a quarter to quarter basis they may fluctuate approximately  to  basis points longer term gross margins will continue to be supported by new products with higher value added content continued cost reduction initiatives and migration to lower process notes in addition we continue to experience a favorable pricing and competitive environment and anticipated pricing pressure in  will remain subdued gaap operating expenses in the first quarter were  million as compared to  million in the prior year quarter and that quarter included a gain of  million from a settlement with the former foundry supplier gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter of  were  million on a nongaap basis operating expenses in the first quarter were  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the prior quarter for the full year  we expect nongaap opex to remain relatively flat when compared to  now looking at first quarter nongaap opex in more detail rd expenses were  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the prior quarter we continue to focus our resources on several market opportunities that we believe can have a more near term revenue contribution and thats resulted in lower rd expenditures nongaap sales and marketing expenses were  million as compared to  million in the year ago period and  million last quarter nongaap ga expenses were  million as compared to  million in the year ago quarter and  million last quarter stock base comp in the first quarter was  amortization of intangible assets was  and depreciation in amortization was  accounting for these items adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  was a loss of  million as compared to a loss of  million in the first quarter of  and a loss of  last quarter gaap net loss for the first quarter was  million or  per share as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  first quarter nongaap net loss was  million so  per share as compared to net loss of  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  share count used to compute the fourth quarter gaap and nongaap net loss was  million shares in terms of balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million in cash inventory at the end of the quarter was  million thats down from  million last quarter our inventory metrics have continued to improve over last year and this quarter exceeded our targeted turns of x accounts receivable was  million that represents a dso of approximately every  days now with respect to guidance for the second quarter of  we currently expect to achieve a record revenue level ranging between  million to  million at the midpoint this implies year over year revenue growth of  gross margin for the second quarter is expected to range between  and  gaap operating expenses are expected to range between  million and  million and nongaap operating expenses between  million and  million stock base comp in the second quarter will be approximately  amortization of intangible assets will be approximately  and depreciation and amortization will be approximately  weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately  million shares in the second quarter so before opening the call of questions id like to summarize my comments and operating objectives first we continue to control operating expenses and demonstrate leverage in our operating model second we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter by  over the prior year period and set a new quarterly record third were on track to achieve our target of ebitda breakeven by the middle of the year fourth we have direct access to additional working capital exceeded with our recently filed shelf offering which has been declared effective by the sec and lastly we remain focus on winning more designs and new customers in the months ahead with that well open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from gary mobley of benchmark your line is open gary mobley good afternoon gentlemen congrats on a strong quarter and a strong guide a question about the pricing environment i think its been pretty well documented that some of your more commodity or competitors or comparables over in taiwan had been raising prices and experiencing tight supply and its also my understanding that you guys have preterm and pricing schedules with customers so how has this overall pricing environment impacted you is it a situation where your asps are falling slower than expected or is it helping your design win traction as an alternative to these commodity memories since it might be more price comparable narbeh derhacobian hi gary its narbeh its more  the effect for us is more of the latter so as i mentioned previously when we do engage with our customer on applications with specific solutions the alternative for the customer is always to go the commodity route and of course we have to offer enough value with our solutions and ask a premium over the commodity that is just enough so the economics make sense for the customer so when prices are firming up on commodity devices with the types of more in securing design wins which is good for us because as you know this become more sticky design wins the effect were seeing today in terms of more immediate guides on where we ended up the quarter like you said is in part negotiating with the customers in the past and this recent price stability with the commodity supplier is not really affecting us that much gary mobley okay as it relates to the supply environment or tight supply environment or flash are you affected at all by perhaps some extremely utilization rates with some of your foundry partners narbeh derhacobian thats always a concern obviously when you have supply tightening the market and you know weve seen this before and we work very closely with our suppliers at various level and just to ensure that you know we can deliver to the customers so were aware of it and just like any of the other memory suppliers are and were on top of it and right now were not seeing any major concerns from that part gary mobley okay thats it for me thanks for taking my question guys narbeh derhacobian sure operator our next question comes from suji desilva of roth capital your line is open suji desilva hi narbeh hi ron congratulations on the strong results and guidance here so as we look at s growth we would be expecting do you think it comes more from the consumer side more from the industrial side or is it fairly balanced out or is there seasonality there narbeh derhacobian you mean for the rest of the year suji desilva correct narbeh derhacobian well i tell you its broadbased for us i think weve seen  you know for example weve seen some of our leading returning customers basically ramping into productions again these are all the design wins that we piled up and weve been talking about on different conference calls and conferences you know they are beginning to ramp into production and you know the industrial always has a longer lead time on consumer so i think thats the effects were seeing we dont see any particular market segment standing out either in a positive or a negative way suji desilva okay good thats helpful and then the new products that are coming online to help you grow with ecoxip and others are they on schedule to track to production versus where you expect it three months ago are any coming in sooner or any perhaps getting put out a little bit that color would be helpful narbeh derhacobian well everything is on schedule you know were aware you know the products that we taped out in the first quarter and are sampling with the early customers and i shed some color as what to expect for the rest of the year from new products tapeouts today in the call so far everything is on schedule suji desilva okay and then a quick question for ron ron the headcount kind of expectation the end of year versus now are you expecting to grow that count much or is that something thats relatively in place now ron shelton you know for the most part in place there might be one or two ads here or there but its effectively in place suji desilva okay two last questions one on the china meter market is that one that you think has a good kind of ramp opportunity in the second half because of the potential volumes there is that something that comes in slowly any thoughts there would be helpful narbeh derhacobian no i wouldnt  i  yes i think its like any industrial market it will be a slow ramp and if we have a key milestone outside what i just talked about we will basically communicate that but right now were just seeing an increased level of sampling activity for the various industrial markets metering being just one of them in asia suji desilva okay and then just one last clarification lighting is that going to be an industrial category or a consumer category or a mix of both narbeh derhacobian we put that in the consumer space suji desilva okay great thanks guys once again congratulations ron shelton thanks suji operator our next question comes from rick schafer of oppenheimer your line is open rick schafer yes thanks guys and ill add my congratulation as well maybe a follow up first to an earlier question would you be able to compare the revenue contribution from fusion flash you know you have cbram today and then maybe where you expect that kind of mix to look or what you expect it to look like exiting this year just to kind of give us an idea of the relative  maybe what relative growth rates are ron shelton yes hey rick this is ron you know today and historically dataflash has been about  of the revenue and i guess as we go through the year you know narbeh talked about in his earlier comments that the standard flash products may exit the year at  or around  of overall revenue and fusion will come up as we go through the year so i would expect dataflash to probably come down closer to  and with the balance split between standard serial flash and fusion this year cbram or  and ecoxip arent a material contributor to revenue and those will start to ramp sometime in  rick schafer okay thanks and then speaking of cbram i mean when we would look out toward earlier  or when you expect it to start ramping where do you see initial traction being the strongest there you know if youre talking about and end market like industrial or consumer pc elsewhere narbeh derhacobian yes so again i would focus more on the product families right so if i look the mavriq which is i think what youre referring to the mavriq family our main focus especially with this new camera module specific product that we tapedout is the camera module market obviously weve been getting qualified sampling with some contract manufacturers as i mentioned in that area just to seed the market and right now were engaged with all the top tier camera module manufacturers showcasing what we have today and also letting them know whats the new camera module specific product which is about to  we should have samples of that late in the year so once we have a design win i would be able to shed more color on that but our focus is going to be there in terms of the camera module market in  rick schafer got it thanks guys thats it for me operator our next question comes from rajvindra gill of needham  company your line is open rajvindra gill yes thanks for taking my questions and i echo the congratulations so a question on the ecoxip product can you talk a little bit about the  you know the asp for the product and the density for the product you know relative to the fusion family i would assume it would have higher asps potentially maybe if you could elaborate on that that would be helpful narbeh derhacobian sure so first in terms of density there is the first ecoxip product that we produced we have samples again either a mb and youre right typically the ecoxip products are targeting higher density applications so  and i mentioned were taping out the megabyte version of the ecoxip this quarter and really the way we decide what to tape out when is really the engagement with lead high volume customers to understand timing of when they are releasing their socs of mcus to intercept with that in terms of asps naturally they are higher than the fusion because first of all just with the memory so its a bigger die a discrete higher density higher asp but also more importantly the business model of ecoxip is slightly different than the fusion the fusion typically is sold as component package device we some opportunities that we sell fusion as a known good die but in the case of ecoxip the equation is reverse so wed be selling that more in terms of known good dies as a system in package applications and so as such the cost of the package and the  you know the final test is not a part of the product so average asps i would say you know its  youre looking above   again it depends on the customers and volumes and so forth whereas fusion family on the average asps youre looking at you know less than  you know close to half or less than that rajvindra gill all right thats helpful and we talk a little bit about  you know on the fusion flash business in the last quarter you said that you had shipped about  million fusion flash units and you expect that to double in  are we still on track there and can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the specific demand drivers for the fusion flash product this year has the design mix been changing for you narbeh derhacobian yes so the main driver again is vastly operated connected devices like bluetooth and so forth in terms of being on track for the half year the answer is yes if i look at volume shipment quarter q of  versus  were up significantly over last year for this quarter so were on track for  to hit the numbers that we talked about in  rajvindra gill and the last question for me ron in terms of the balance sheet how do we think about deleveraging i think in the past you had said that you were  you know theres a goal to pay down the debt how do we think about debt repayment and going forward thank you ron shelton sure so the terms thats amotizing right now is amortizing about a million seven a quarter so you know from  we talked about getting ebitda positive in the middle of this year you take that combined with you know growing revenues growing profitability you know managing working capital well we have enough capital today to service debt and run the business rajvindra gill thank you narbeh derhacobian yes operator our next question comes from orin hirschman of aigh investment partners your line is open orin hirschman hi how are you narbeh derhacobian hi orin how are you orin hirschman good okay im good ill ask you two question for now one is you had mentioned in the passing of the nxp what you are working on with nxp with qualcomm is that  were you referring to reference designs or were you referring to actually the first early design wins sorry i wasnt clear on that narbeh derhacobian so we talked about this in fact there was a press release on this as well the joint press release with nxp so its a design win for ecoxip product and again this one because its  really the product is being sold two ways to the customer in one case its going to be as a known good die to be attached within the package with mcus and the second case it would be a part of reference designs so its a combination of what you just mentioned orin hirschman okay but that first design was what you were  design win was what you were referring to narbeh derhacobian no so what  in case of the ecoxip the customer has to incorporate basically the interface to be able to take full advantage of the ecoxip inside their soc or mcus orin hirschman okay narbeh derhacobian so in the case of several customers and actually being one of them they have done that orin hirschman okay narbeh derhacobian in fact we designed the part in collaboration with several competing customers like nxp orin hirschman okay and just going back to the camera modules were you actually in  even if its very small volumes today or are you actually in the commercial module narbeh derhacobian no were not so what we did is we were able to showcase the benefits of the mavriq platform with a large contract manufacturer in the camera module and together we went to bid on a camera module business of a large chinese camera module maker what happened is the camera module marker decided to go with a different contract manufacturer so we adesto lost that opportunity but what it ended up happening is we realized its a huge opportunity and the mavriq platform is ideally suited for this application today and where its going two three four years down the road so we put a concerted effort to design solutions specific for that end market and since then this was about a year ago weve been engaged with other contract manufacturers as well as module makers to kind of prepare them for this new product that well be releasing end of the year orin hirschman and is the driver there the module maker or is the driver the actual end customer that makes whats in the handset narbeh derhacobian for  the first one is the module maker benefits is  cant come to the module maker the contract manufacturer or the end camera user because end of today were using the cost of embedding camera modules in gadgets orin hirschman okay great okay thanks very much operator there are no further questions id like to turn the call back over to narbeh for any closing remarks narbeh derhacobian thank you thanks for joining us today before i conclude todays call id like to
