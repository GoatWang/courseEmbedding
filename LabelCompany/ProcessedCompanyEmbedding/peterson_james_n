product peterson university flake g great tasting flake and you just dont get tired of smoking it favorite peterson flake march   by charles m product peterson university flake g nice well rounded vaburley flake here the plum topping is more predominantly in the tin and room notes rather than in taste and is so very pleasing i have a bjarne pipe designated to a foldnstuff filling of university flake it lights well a read more nd burns without issue i forgot about a tin in the back of the cupboard for a few years man this ages well i just bought a few tins to lose again dont let it dry out i prefer to keep it a little damp as its tinned and just know that ill need to sit a flake out for a few hours before smoking sit it out with your morning bowl and load this for some afternoon delight this is in my regular rotation for when i need something a little lighter and a little sweeter read less plum fantastic january   by randy c product peterson university flake g i first experienced this flake at a local brick and mortar store and fell in love with it the plum topping is evident in the tin note but not overly sweet after the char light one of my top tobaccos one of the favorites october   by joshua l product peterson university flake g this is one of the few peterson blends that i really like the plum topping is good it packs just enough punch to get you where youre going nice flake with plum topping september   by david f product peterson university flake g this is very similar to erinmore flake but stronger and with a distinct plum topping smokes nicely deep flavors a nice flake to have in the cupboard for occasional smokes davidoff flake medallions baby sister september   by ahmad o product peterson university flake g upon opening the customary square tin of flakes you are grested with an earthyfruity aroma resembling that of erinmore flakes but make no mistake this is nothing alike maybe except in the generous amount if virginia in both the flakes are well p read more ressed and presented in a fashion worthy of peterson name it packs easily but i discovered that packing it as a flake makes it hard to light and keep lit as it seems it was well pressed so breaking the flakes as i did or rubbing it would be better once it is packed like that it shone grassy smoky virginias takes over with a little hint of nutiness at times and fruitiness at others it is well rounded all day virginia smoke and i couldnt help to make the connection of this as a milder version of davidoff flake medallions read less not bad august   by daniel s product peterson university flake g it is good just not great with other better blends like this out there for my tastes this is forgettable nice smoke july   by den j product peterson university flake g scored some of this stuff from a friend and i must say its pretty decent not the most flavorful as other virginaburley ive had this stuff stays lit forever only had to fire up the bowl twice smooth satisfying july   by haslizan a product peterson university flake g newbie previous ciggarette smoker uf is a must have gradually experiment on other blends although newbies tend to go for aromatic blends for a start nice virginia may   by tom k product peterson university flake g very pleasant smoke not my favorite but good to keep a tin around tart march   by carl j product peterson university flake g ive revisited this blend after trying it several years ago the fruit topping is most notable on the initial light it takes a more or less prominent role throughout partially muting the tobaccos more or less the after taste is the most memorable  read more part which is a tart almost sour taste it is a good blend but dont be expecting a powerhouse in either topping or tobacco taste read less tasteless may   by alex c product peterson university flake g compared to irish flake with similar tobaccos this is bland initial impressions i squirmed at the taste one of the best february   by ethan f product peterson university flake g this was one of my first virginias and still my favorite there is a slight plum topping that comes out in the smoke it is very subtle and sweet it doesnt taste like a chemical most of the flavor is a mellow va taste mild but flavorful best va flake to me december   by andrea m product peterson university flake g some people tastes some plum aroma but not me i swear i cant feel any chemical aroma only the sweet fundamental note of virginia which is pretty strong but rounded up by the burley good tobacco december   by marut b product peterson university flake g i dont know why but i like it may be i like it cause the aroma of this tobacco every things not too much superior flake june   by mark g product peterson university flake g easy smokingstays lit welleasy on the tonguetastes very good not offensive to other people in this tobacco spooked world we live ina nice hint of lemonalso ages very wellfirst class all the wayif i was not so hooked on the taste of more power read more ful english blends with cyprian latakiait would be my number one blendwith no doubtsalso because of the high sugar content of the virginia tobacco it will break a new pipe in ten times quicker read less not for me february   by benjamin w product peterson university flake g tastes like a cigar kind of strong to me if i wanted to smoke a cigar i would smoke a cigar i dont want a cigar in my pipe lol very good tin november   by adam b product peterson university flake g i do not smoke terribly often and smoke tinned tobacco less often but this is my goto tin when i do i very much enjoy it a sweet plum taste as mentioned by others it smokes easily and cool it is great to fill the rather deep bowl on my skov read more gaard horn and pair with a glass of bourbon or islay scotch read less great anytime august   by robert o product peterson university flake g i picked this up the other day due to the fact that so many people seem to like it it was a good call im not a heavy or all day smoker most of the time its with a cup of coffee on the back patio in the morning or at social events in the evening read more so i tend to look for something fairly low in vitamin n and not a lat bomb this flake seems to fit the bill well just for information sake i tend to prefer to rub out my flakes as opposed to the fold and stuff method i allowed the flake to dry for about twenty minuets then loosely rubbed it out leaving it fairly long strands i found it to have a light scent of raspberries in a very present and not overpowering way the tobacco smoked and packed nicely i believe that his could be an easy all day smoke if i were that type of person the taste was mild to medium in strength and had a pleasant aroma i definitely plan on purchasing more for cellaring and regular use if you are a flake fan or just curious you definitely need to give this one a try read less my allday april   by thomas w product peterson university flake g this is hands down my favorite flake even though i typically smoke vapers i can and do sometimes go bowl to bowl on this one i love cubing it but it folds great too a nice burley taste predominates and i havent been bit yet excellent friend of bourbon february   by matthew l product peterson university flake g this is an excellent flake to smoke it retains a certain spicy quality very nice to be able to rub out your own flake according to the size you desire to fill your pipe this goes amazingly well with a good glass of bourbon not for me november   by david n product peterson university flake g got it free with my new peterson xl green spigot very nice however this blend tasted like a cigarette to me wife did not approve either good tobacco november   by lane o

product peterson university flake g i cant get enough of this blend i like to keep a tin nearby just to open and take in the aroma when im not smoking i have more peterson pipes than any other brand my family are irish and i find it fitting to smoke university flake through them read more i like mild cool smoke and i dont need to make a trade off on taste with this the mahoganyburleyvirginia ratio is bang on im very proud of my stack of tins read less excellent june   by john c product peterson university flake g university flake is excellent  in my pipe it has what they call a plum taste
