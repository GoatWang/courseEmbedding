licensing modelaccesswiremarch  reblogsharetweetsharelas vegas nv  accesswire  march    brk inc pink sheets brkk announced today that it was preparing to move to including a licensing model in essence what this means is that it will now license its helmet camera system to licensees for new product development based on the ip and for the commercialization of those productsby becoming a licensor brk hopes to attract licensees who are best in class in their particular niches in order to leverage its ip into more products than it could produce itselfthe refcam is proof of concept that the ip works and would be one example of a product that can be produced from the ip stated brian keasberry ceo of brk inc im sure there are others we havent thought of and this opens up the field for us to form partnerships with creative people in a wide variety of industries it also frees us up from being exclusively manufacturers – which ties up a lot of capital for a small companyfor products the company intends to develop itself – and it says its got some in the pipeline it will outsource the research and development to american companies with expertise in the field theres no point in our having an rd department inhouse when there is so much talent available in our backyard and our research on our ip is basically done keasberry further stated to that end the board of directors has been given and accepted the resignation of chris stramacchia as cto and director of brk inc with gratitude for services rendered chris was spreading himself too thin – going to games trying to develop new products and helping at the corporate level now he can do what hes good at – tinkering and inventing and if one of those new products is based on our ip then he can become a licensee for that particular productfurther to its new goal of becoming a licensor for the ip brk has decided not to bid on the  olympic games after further reviewing the commitment of resources necessary to satisfy all parties concerned it doesnt make sense for us to send a crew and equipment half way across the world for a oneoff opportunity explained keasberry the economics just arent there our focus now is on strictly growing revenuesbrk inc invites fans to sign up for advance notice of games featuring the refcam at wwwbrkincorporatedcomabout brk incbrk inc pink sheets brkk established in  is owner of the helmet

company established in  in adams massachusetts the combined company was known as berkshire fine spinning associates in  berkshire fine spinning associates merged with the hathaway manufacturing company which had been founded in  in new bedford massachusetts by horatio hathaway with profits from whaling and the china trade hathaway had been successful in its first decades but it suffered during a general decline in the textile industry after world war i at this time hathaway was run by seabury stanton whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the depression after the merger berkshire hathaway had  plants employing over  workers with over  million in revenue and was headquartered in new bedford however seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade accompanied by large layoffs in  warren buffett began buying stock in berkshire hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill eventually buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the companys financial situation was not going to improve in  stanton made an oral tender offer of  ⁄ per share for the company to buy back buffetts shares buffett agreed to the deal a few weeks later warren buffett received the tender offer in writing but the tender offer was for only  ⁄ buffett later admitted that this lower undercutting offer made him angry instead of selling at the slightly lower price buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire stanton which he did however this put buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing buffett initially maintained berkshires core business of textiles but by  he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of national indemnity company in the late s berkshire acquired an equity stake in the government employees insurance company geico which forms the core of its insurance operations today and is a major source of capital for berkshire hathaways other investments in  the last textile operations hathaways historic core were shut down in  buffett claimed that purchasing berkshire hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about  billion over the subsequent  years buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out berkshire hathaway due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual those investments would have paid off several hundredfoldcitation needed on june   it was announced that berkshire hathaway had settled with californias insurance regulator allowing its applied underwriters unit to sell a revised version of its controversial compensation insurance policies for workers in the state corporate
