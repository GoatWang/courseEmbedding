corporation gulf as a result of various transactions that have occurred since  the gulf interests are now held by chevron corporation chevron elf exploration inc elf and their assignees the indenture provides that the term of the trust will expire on june   unless extended by the vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interests the trust’s whollyowned subsidiary marine petroleum corporation holds title to interests in properties subject to the trust’s interest that are situated offshore of louisiana ninetyeight percent of all oil natural gas and other mineral royalties collected by marine petroleum corporation less the cost of receiving and collecting are paid to the trust approximately  percent of marine’s royalty revenues are attributable to oil and approximately  percent are ttributable to natural gas the royalty revenues received by marine are affected by a number of factors including the producing capabilities of the wells seasonal fluctuations in demand and by changes in the market price for oil and natural gas the royalty interests held by marine are depleting with each barrel of oil and cubic foot of natural gas produced no funds are reinvested by marine thus these depleting assets are not being replaced both marine petroleum corporation and the trust are prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and does only

an aftermarket part or stick with original equipment manufacturer oem parts  there is some controversy over this but the debate is far from being cut and dried  read more like most others i once believed that an oem part was always superior to an aftermarket part  unfortunately the word “aftermarket” seems to carry some negative connotations  so what are the real differences between an oem part and an aftermarket part and where do aftermarket parts find their place in this day and age some time ago there was no such thing as an “aftermarket” part  everything was made directly by the original manufacturers  eventually these manufacturers found it beneficial to outsource production and manufacturing duties to other factories who were one day also able to replicate these parts and sell them to other distributors  these parts became known as aftermarket when most people think of aftermarket parts they probably think of a huge production line overseas pumping out mass quantities of lowquality parts  while this sometimes may not be far from the truth these parts are usually of a higher quality than one would originally expect  in fact these parts are more often than not the exact same part that you would get from an authorized dealer  the reason for this is that a lot of the original manufacturers use the same factories and even the same companies to manufacture their parts  so what is often the big difference between these parts  the answer is the packaging the part comes in and the brand that it is labeled as being there are several reasons why you might choose an aftermarket part over its oem alternative  in this day and age we find most people going aftermarket for economic reasons oem dealers often get by under the guise that their parts are original and therefore are superior or that an aftermarket part is cheap and will underperform and potentially damage your motor  this enables them to charge astronomical prices in most cases whereas an aftermarket part is usually far less expensive aside from that you may be the owner of an older motor or boat and the oem part is no longer available but an aftermarket company still makes a replacement for said part or you simply can’t find the oem part in your area whereas you can easily find and order an aftermarket alternative online perhaps you want to change either the appearance of the performance of your motor or boat from its stock condition and no authorized dealer can help you find what you need  maybe your boat is taking too long to plane out evenly and you want to adjust the pitch of your propeller but an oem propeller isn’t offered in anything other than what you already have  most likely you can find various aftermarket propellers to achieve this these are just a few examples of why you may find it beneficial to go with an aftermarket part  the debate rages on over which is better and why but the evidence is clear and shouldn’t sway you from deciding to go aftermarket  your wallet and boat may thank you for it read less  tips to keeping your boat motor cool overheating is a major cause of death for marine enginesincluding gas and diesel stern drives inboards and outboard motors in fact some industry statistics say as many of  of all premature engine deaths emanate from the malady  read more saving the day some modern power plants have engine warning systems that literally sound the alarm when the temperature begins to rise towards dangerous temperatures when that happens onboard firmware automatically reduces rpm so the boat can in most cases limp home that technology is a great fail safe but what would be even better is some kind of plan to prevent the overheating in the first place with that in mind here are some ideas to keep in mind most of the time engines overheat because the impeller isn’t pumping water to the cylinder block and heads so naturally it follows  keeping track of impeller health is a good idea on inboards and stern drives that can be as simple as removing the inspection cover and looking at it you don’t necessarily have to remove it visually determine whether all of the blades are present and are any of the blades showing cracks or checkering if so don’t hesitate to replace the worn impeller at once not only is it in danger of complete failure when blades strip off they flow downstream into the engine where they could obstruct cooling flow another important checkpoint is the raw water filter go to the trouble of making sure it’s not plugged at the same time check all of the cooling system hoses one at a time start at the hull thru fitting visually inspect the hoses with a flashlight looking for checkering or cracks once again clues that near term failure is possible next squeeze each hose in turn a cooling hose should feel supple and not hard most of the time when you find a hardened hose it will be on the engine that’s because ambient engine heat hour after running hour has baked it to a crisp outboard motor impellers are strategically located in the lower unit the lower unit is exposed to sunlight which over time can bake the impeller baked impellers have lost resilience hard impeller blades strip off also over time and this includes inboard and stern drive impellers impellers lose their flexibility and take a set  meaning the blades don’t stick out from the hub at a  degree angle and are curved when that happens they will still pump water just not very much knowing that some boat owners make a preemptive strike and remove and replace the impeller every two or three years another overheating culprit is the thermostat sometimes they stick open in which case the engine may not warm up to its normal operating temperature and in other instances the thermostat sticks tight in the closed position the good news is changing a thermostat is easy even for a fumble fingered doityourselfer but what do you do when you think the engine is overheating and you don’t have or simply don’t trust the temperature gauge the answer is as simple as the sea is salt shut down the engine for safety sake then carefully touch the cylinder head you should almost but not quite be able to lay you hand on it but if it is sizzling hot there’s an overheating problem if you’re squeamish about touching a warm engine no problem flick some water onto the engine and watch the results if the water beads up and sizzles away into evaporation there’s a problem there are other high tech solutions worth considering for about  and up you can buy an infrared temperature gun to use it simply aim it at the work piece and squeeze the trigger the temperature display tells you how hot it is also you should know about temperature crayons they come denominated in different temperature ranges with this method scribe a mark with the crayon on the work piece if the crayon residue melts then the temperature is as least the rating of the crayon besides the temp gauge outboard motors also shoot an indicator stream that shows the impeller is hard working sometimes when the stream stops it means the impeller is dead sometimes it just means the indicator streams plumbing is plugged up that’s why i have a twofoot section of pound monofilament fish line under the cowling tied to the engine if the stream stops i jab the stiff monofilament into the orifice and clean it out if water begins to flow anew all is well finally the best prevention for engine overheating is to trust the temperature gauge and monitor it often consider rotating the temp gauge so its needle points straight up when registering normal engine temperature then if the temp begins to rise you’ll see it immediatelyiboatscom carries all brands of impellers thermostats hoses gauges and more   written by tim

technician today magazine summer  what exactly is a tuneup  by definition a tuneup is a series of lubrications tests and adjustments that the manufacturer requires at specified intervals to keep the engine in peak operating condition a quality shop will perform various checks and procedures to keep their customers happy and remaining loyal to them no technician or shop owner wants to hear about a customer stranded on the water like the couple shown in figure  most outboards require service every  hours or once a year whichever comes first evinrude etec models have a longer schedule –  years hours in freshwater with freshwater recreational use boaters in saltwater areas and those in commercial usage or high performance boating have shorter service periods because of the corrosive nature of seawater and the heavier duty operating conditions a stroke may require  hours or  month interval oil changes if the motor is run at low speeds trolling or high speeds for extended periods of time if it has an “extended warranty” in order to keep it valid most contracts state “…the engine must be maintained per manufacture’s recommendations” keep in mind that the whole rig should be visually inspected for overall condition and what service needs are to be recommended types of usage commercial highperformance etc and environmental conditions salt muddy or shallow water determine the type and the frequency of service needed discuss water pump and thermostat servicing with your customer this also depends on operating conditions and type of use as well as engine hours do not attempt to service without the correct service manual tools supplies and a thorough understanding of the procedures use common sense and observe safety precautions around moving parts flammable liquids and high voltage ignitions with both stroke and stroke engines each particular outboard is different and may have additional items that have to be addressed this article is only an overview of servicing procedures inspection and propeller the first step is a complete visual inspection of the motor along with the steering system and control cables and other boat systems check hoses for deterioration and inspect everything for leaks and for worn damaged or missing items remove the propeller and look for fishing line in the seals timing belts air filters and alternator belts are some additional inspection items along with belt tensioners and pulleys that various outboards have props should be rebuilt or replaced if damaged to prevent harmful vibrations from affecting the outboard for safety leave the propeller off until all the servicing is completed check and replace the zinc anodes if needed some strokes use internal cylinder block anodes for cooling system corrosion protection sparkplugs and ignition remove the plugs and lay them out in order note if any one sparkplug looks significantly different from the others a good plug has sharp edges on the side and center electrodes with no rounded or eroded areas flakes of carbon mean a possible rich running poor oil quality leaking injectors or open thermostats a tan center ceramic is ideal but in outboards the color can vary from off white to almost black always check for the outboard manufacture’s latest plug recommendations since changes may have taken place since a manual was printed evinrude ficht and etec engines require an additional step of positioning indexing the plug gap within ° on either side of the fuel injector nozzle centerline ignition output is important for quick starting smooth idling and good acceleration perform the procedures outlined in the service manual using the proper tools if the spark is weak or not consistent find out why before going any further inspect the wiring coils and connections for carbon tracks or deterioration replace and gap the sparkplugs if needed compression a compression test indicates the internal condition of the motor’s pistons cylinders and rings use a quality gauge and record the readings most manuals do not list the compression pressures but recommend results within  of each other on a healthy engine some yamaha and johnsonevinrude outboards have staggered compression ratios so the bottom cylinders could have lower readings than the upper ones but they should be close from side to side a scored cylinder or piston may give a good reading at times because of residual oil sealing the grooves occasionally a low cylinder will improve after using a carboncleaning compound that frees up the stuck piston rings this is a good time to torque the head bolts while the motor is cold if applicable perform a leakdown test on stroke engines as that is the only true test of those motor’s internal health by listening to air coming out of the intake exhaust or crankcase it is easy to determine the source of leakage on a cylinder and piston that does not hold at least  of the air from the tester gearcase drain the lower unit oil if clear water comes out or metal chips are seen the gearcase should be disassembled and inspected metal “fuzz” on magnetic drain plugs is normal but chunks or chips are not use the manufacture’s recommended lubricant and refill from the lower hole until oil appears at the upper threads new gaskets or orings under the screws assure a tight seal inspect the prop shaft for wobble and the seals for damage or fishing line grease the splines to prevent corrosion and a stuck prop install a new cotterpin if applicable lubrication lubricate all the fittings with approved marine grease hood latches and other sliding parts work easier with a slight film of lube use silicone spray on carb linkages contrary to the glob of grease that some factories recommend avoid spraying around the starter drive to prevent it from slipping if you have a fuel injected yamaha ox keep silicone away from the oxygen sensor located on the starboard side use care with a petroleumbased coatings if you spray it on the engine for corrosion prevention sparkplug wires rubber and plastic could be affected a greasy film will attract dirt and grit plus it makes future servicing a sticky messy ordeal you will spend extra time and shop rags cleaning off your hands and tools quite often to keep fingerprints from the boat’s upholstery trim and gelcoat strokes require and oil and filter change which is best done while the motor is warm an experienced technician will soon learn a servicing sequence that will maximize his efficiency in performing the tuneup procedure in the shortest amount of time for best results use an fcw certified stroke outboard oil if you do not use the manufacturer’s oil that way it prevents any question of improper lubricant use should a warranty situation arise down the road linkage synchronization of the spark timing to the throttle opening and the removal of the carb or throttle body linkage freeplay are known as “sync and link” adjustments service manuals show detailed step by step instructions because of the importance of these settings for a smooth running motor do not overlook the oil pump linkage adjustments on certain stroke engines electronic fuel injected motors may require a throttle position sensor tps adjustment using a digital voltmeter again follow the manual exactly for this critical setting warning systems test the integrity of the alarm systems with the key on and motor off disconnect the temp sender wire connector and ground it with a test lead the warning horn should sound on system check gauges the overheat led will illuminate but the buzzer will not activate unless the motor is running it is wise to test oil pressure switches and waterinfilter sensors if equipped per the service manual digital dash gauges may have different procedures fuel and oil using a clean glass jar to inspect a fuel sample from the engine it should be clean and clear with no debris water or varnish smell a turkeybaster works well for sampling the bottom of a remote oil tanks for sludge water or gelled oil the engine mounted tanks on v and v yamahas collect condensation in a ” clear hose and should be examined regularly suzuki and yamaha recommend the annual replacement of the oil filter assembly between the tank and the oil pump replace andor clean all boat mounted and motor mounted filters if there is no boat mounted fuelwater separator suggest one for your customer and emphasize its importance with today’s ethanol fuels which attract moisture pour the correct amount of a fuel additive into the gas tank to help clean out the system and to stabilize the fuel this is very important if ethanol e gasoline is used inspect the condition of the hoses clamps and any fuel valves electrical system use an ammeter in conjunction with a voltmeter to test the electrical system crank the engine for about  seconds with the kill switch removed a healthy battery will show  volts or more during cranking or test it with a quality load tester make sure the battery terminals and cable ends are shiny clean and replace any wingnuts with regular nuts and lockwashers for secure connections distilled water is recommended for topping off regular batteries according to abyc standards the positive terminals should be protected with vinyl covers if the battery is not mounted in a covered box and the battery is to be securely tied down so it will not move around in rough water start the motor and monitor an inductive ammeter to read the charging output compare the results with the service manual specifications on computer controlled outboards download an engine report from the ecu and save it with the customer service records technically oriented owners may want a copy for themselves check for any error codes and correct any recent abnormal indications timing and temperature set the carbpickup timing or engine idle timing according to the service manual in addition to the linkage adjustments thermostat operation can be checked with an infrared temp gun or the finger method if you can hold your fingers on top of each cylinder head for more than  full seconds chances are that the engine is not warming up enough for proper operation carbon cleaning periodic use of a carbon remover is essential to long outboard life by keeping the rings and the pistons free of accumulated combustion byproducts on both stroke and stroke outboards cleaners like mercury’s power tune yamaha’s combustion cleaner or evinrude’s engine tuner have instructions on the can after waiting the recommended amount of time run the engine for at least  minutes at low speed to clean things out before applying full power do this before changing engine oil and filter in a stroke for even better cleaning add the proper quantity of a fuel additive carbon cleaner to the gas tank according to the manufacturer’s policies final adjustments idle speed and carb adjustments if equipped must be done in the water for proper exhaust backpressure not on a hose flusher use an accurate tachometer and be patient while getting everything “dialed in” perfectly some multicarb and certain efi engines may need intake vacuum balancing for a smooth and consistent idle do not overlook valve adjustments that may be required at specified intervals although they are not often part of a regular tuneup they are an important procedure affecting the drivability and longevity of a stroke outboard run the boat at all speeds after carefully setting the full throttle timing if required check that the top operating rpm is within the upper half of the factory recommended range for best performance read less the basic parts of a boat although no two boat models are exactly alike all boats have the same basic layout and format  read more hull the hull is the overall bodyshape of the boat different shapes appeal better to certain boat styles there are five basic hull types flat shallow vee deep vee round and catamaran the hulls size is measured by two main measurements  centerline length from tip of the bow to the edge of the transom and  beam width from the widest point on the gunwale the bow at the tiphead of the boat is the bow the bow of the boat can be opened or closed depending on the make some open bow models will have installed seatsseating groups simultaneously some models include windshields andor bow rails whether they are opened or closed bow sterntransom the stern and transom are at the rear of the boat propellers and engines are always in the sterntransom area which gives all boats their primary source of movement this area includes features such as engines specifically outboard transom ladders swim platforms and so on portstarboardgunwale the port side of a boat indicates the lefthand side of the boat when standing in the boat and facing directly toward the bow similarly the starboard side of the boat is the righthand side the sides of the port and starboard positions where different accessories and components are mounted is the gunwale gunnel the gunwale allows several different features to be installed onto it depending on the style of boat such as bimini tops wakeboard towers side rails etc engines there are three main styles of engines outboard sterndrive and inboard engines are stored either at the transom of the boat or stored within the hull with the rest of the engine protruding out the backside outboard sterndrive inboard these different engines pair up with certain boats depending on the boats style and size the type of steering and many other contributing factors read less
