billiton turbulence aheadmar   about bhp billiton bbl christiaan casper growth at reasonable price long only value longterm horizonsummarycommodity prices have been on the recovery which leads to tailwinds in the mining sector bhp billiton faces significant short term firmspecific risks investors may want to hold off investing until the strike ends and economics consequences concerning the tailings dam failure are known investment thesis bhp billiton nysebbl operates in a challenging environment and is subject to multiple risk factors although commodity prices have made a significant comeback over the past months the risk factors may hint at an economic mostly firmspecific setback i argue that until there is more certainty with regard to litigation costs investors may want to postpone their investment decision introduction bhp billiton is a producer of natural resources including iron ore metallurgical coal nickel and copper as well as crude oil and gas in australia and the americas the company has come into existence after a merger between an australian nysebhp and british billiton mining company in  the products are sold worldwide the annual report ranges from july st till june th considering commodity prices and profit margins recovering and the price of iron ore having increased just short of  over the past  months is investing in bhp billiton a wise decision source business insider essentials and dividends bhp billiton has a return on equity of  by comparison metal mining average return on equity was  according to csimarketcom the company trades at a pricetobook ratio of  and has a strong operating margin of  a pe ratio of  and eps of  bhp billiton has a long term debt of little over  billion dollars on the other hand it is apparent that bhp billiton is able to bear its interest expense as it has a current ratio of  which is significantly above  the currency risk which will be more thoroughly discussed later it is exposed to will likely not affect the currency ratio to the point that the company will not be able to pay its short term liabilities a quick ratio of  is a healthy sign as well source company data bhp billiton has introduced a new dividend policy in  and intends to payout a minimum of  of underlying attributable profit at every reporting period the dividend policy provides for a minimum  percent payout of underlying attributable profit at every reporting period for fy the board determined a final dividend of  us cents per share which is covered by free cash flow this dividend comprises the minimum payout per share plus an additional amount of six us cents per share at every reporting period the board will assess the companys capacity to pay amounts additional to the minimum payment in accordance with the capital allocation framework the resulting dividend may actually turn out to be greater than the minimum as illustrated by the additional  cents per share  to the minimum payout of  cents in this case the trailing twelve month dividend rate is set at  cents while the  year average dividend yield is  source seeking alpha bhp billiton will go exdividend on march th  for the new york and johannesburg stock exchanges and will go exdividend on march th for the australian and london stock exchanges the record date which is also the currency conversion rate will be march th  the payment will take place on march th  the dividend prospect is as follows source company data rising prices for commodities relate to stronger profitability an update from the operational report of january th  shows indicates the following prices changes with most notably an increase of  in hard coking coal source company data risks compared to  bhp billitons  product prices have considerably declined the result is that tight margins have affected the firm as it is its policy is to sell products at prevailing market prices the recovering prices should positively affect future earnings and divers products may hedge some of the price risk however the annual report illustrates the diversity provided by our broad portfolio of commodities does not necessarily insulate the company from the effects of price changes note from the table below that all average prices from  have declined compared to  this proves that mining product diversification is no reliable hedge against price risk source company data bhp billiton is subject to currency risk as the majority of its cash and cash equivalents are measured in us dollars varying exchange rates may adversely affect bhp billiton in the future on the other hand its interest bearing liabilities also contain a large share of euros and pounds and on top of that the companys operations occur in a large variety of currencies which are all subject to risk from fluctuating exchange rates bhp billiton states the australian dollar chilean peso and us dollar are some of the currencies influencing our operating costs we do not generally believe active currency hedging provides longterm benefits to our shareholders as a result currency hedging is only undergone under exceptional circumstances and short term results are subject to currency risk an immediate threat is posed by the strike at the companys mine in chile as of march th bhp billiton may approach workers individually to end the strike but until that time no production is going on the strike will affect results for the current quarter lastly there is a significant litigation risk which should be accounted for on november th  the samarco dam experienced a tailings dam failure which flooded lower areas killing  people and sending mining waste downstream as a result bhp billiton among others is now defendant concerning a claim of approximately  billion us dollars the operational review states on  january  samarco vale and bhp billiton brasil have also entered into a preliminary agreement with the federal prosecutors office in brazil in relation to the fundão tailings dam failure on  november  preliminary agreement the preliminary agreement outlines the process and timeline for negotiation of a settlement of the brl  billion approximately us billion civil claim relating to the dam failure the result is that bhp billiton will likely incur significant costs in the near future regarding litigation given the broad range of risks bhp billiton faces an investment in the company is subject to a large number of uncertainties low commodity prices currency risk and litigation are some of the risks which should be accounted for there are numerous other risk factors which should be accounted for such as a general decrease in demand and possible governmental regulatory actions it is noteworthy that bhp billiton recognizes these risks and has transparently mentioned them in the annual report however to put the risks into perspective it is important to consider a future outlook of the company future outlook as of now it is uncertain when the litigious setback will occur what is certain however is that the benefits from the increased commodity prices will be incurred in the following fiscal quarters the stock price on the other hand already seems to have reacted to the increase in commodity prices with a rally over the past months source seeking alpha results from the december  half year will be promising due to asset divesting and a reimbursement these results are not sustainable but will generate a oneoff benefit bhp billiton expects underlying attributable profit in the december  half year to include gains related to asset divestments in a range of approximately us million to us million underlying ebitda impact of us million to us million in addition the group expects to record an exceptional item of us million us million posttax related to the cancellation of the caroona exploration license and subsequent reimbursement received during the december  half year in its operational review of january th  bhp billiton has included an indication of the production for the coming quarters the indication is positive as the company is planning on increasing its production in all sectors however if competitors implement the same strategy overproduction may adversely affect prices source company data on a positive note bhp billiton gas incurred lower exploration costs in the copper sector we have secured growth opportunities via brownfield exploration around our portfolio of existing assets principally aimed at delineating and categorizing mineral deposits in resource basins near our existing operations while advancing projects through the development pipeline primarily in copper this has enabled us to reduce brownfield exploration expenditure and to rationalize our greenfield exploration program as a result the exploration costs with regard to copper have greatly decreased in  as seen in the comparative decrease of brownfield exploration costs source company data conclusion it is uncertain whether commodity prices will continue to rise in the future and if margins and efficiency will increase it seems that the stock price has already reacted to the increase in commodity prices but may be subject to a negative shock due to litigious consequences when they are incurred in the short term bhp billiton will likely benefit from oneoff divesting income and reimbursement but also face significant risk factors investors may want to hold off investing until after the strike ends and litigation concerning the tailings dam is settled on the other hand if prices continue to rise in the future bhp billiton faces a bright future disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in bbl over the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it
