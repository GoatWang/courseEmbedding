zebrafish to regenerate retinal tissue in their eyes can be accelerated by controlling the fishes immune systems the new findings may one day advance efforts to combat degenerative eye disease damage in humans the scientists say because evolution likely conserved this mechanism of regenerative potential in other animals a report on their experiments was published in april in proceedings of the national academy of sciences humans have an evolutionary block on our ability to regenerate certain tissues but humans still have the genetic machinery needed to regenerate retinal tissue if we can activate and control it jeffrey mumm associate professor of opthalmology at the cellular level zebrafish and human eyes are remarkably similar said jeffrey mumm associate professor of ophthalmology at the johns hopkins university school of medicine both human and zebrafish eyes contain müller glia an inducible stem cell type that gives zebrafish their remarkable regenerative abilities the researchers say they found evidence that microglia a cell type found in most vertebrae innate immune systems affect the müller glias regenerative response and can be harnessed to accelerate the growth of new tissue in the retina for the study researchers created a model of the human degenerative retinal disease retinitis pigmentosa in zebrafish by incorporating a gene for a specialized enzyme into the rod cells of the fish retina the enzyme has the novel ability to convert a chemical metronidazole into a toxin allowing researchers to selectively kill the cells expressing it after initiating photoreceptor loss in the fish retinas the researchers monitored the immune systems response by tracking the activity of three types of fluorescently labeled immune cells in and around the eye neutrophils microglia and peripheral macrophages they were able to follow the activity of the immune cells using timelapse d microscopy imaging of fish retinas they found that neutrophils the type of immune cells that are typically the first responders to tissue injury were largely unresponsive to photoreceptor death they also observed that the peripheral macrophages sensed the injury but were unable to penetrate the bloodretinal barrier to access the dying cells image caption zebrafish larvae and fluorescently marked immune cells allow researchers to track immune system activity in a model of retinal degeneration image credit david white  hopkins medicine microglia were the only cells the researchers saw that were able to both respond to the injury and reach the injured cells we could see the peripheral macrophages wanted to do something but could not gain access mumm said neutrophils didnt even detect that something had happened but the microglia were at the right place at the right time building on that evidence the researchers conducted tests in zebrafish with the specialized enzyme incorporated into both rod cells and microglial cells removing both cell types to ask what role microglia play during regeneration they found that when microglia were also lost müller glia showed almost no regenerative activity after three days of recovery compared with approximately  percent regeneration in the control population the researchers hope that by harnessing the ability to improve regeneration in zebrafish they can better understand how to induce regeneration in human

renowned strengths in health and medicine the partners behind the new program include the university of maryland under armour’s venture investment firm plank industries brown advisory and the abell foundation “i see all these accelerators out there and they’re cool but particularly when it comes from an investor’s standpoint i think what a lot of these companies need is a vertical accelerator” says paul singh an angel investor who will lead m ventures a vertical accelerator focuses on a particular market sector — for mventures that area is health and fitness the program is open to companies from across the country that are beyond the idea stage with a product for sale and revenues participants will receive  in funding legal and accounting services access to mentors and coworking space in

technology to improve patient safety in the icu project will connect medical devices in effort to reduce preventable harm image credit istock by lisa broadhead  published july   the johns hopkins university school of medicine and microsoft have announced plans to work together to redesign the way medical devices in an intensive care unit talk to each other the two organizations plan to develop a health it solution that collects data from different monitoring equipment and identifies key trends aimed at preventing injuries and complications that can result from medical care the idea stems from the johns hopkins armstrong institute for patient safety and qualitys research on checklists to reduce infections and its pilot program called project emerge which uses technology to restructure a hospitals workflow in an effort to eliminate the most common causes of preventable harm and promote better patient outcomes while most efforts to improve safety focus on one harm project emerge seeks to eliminate all harms including medical complications such as blood clots and pneumonia as well as emotional harms like a lack of respect and dignity todays intensive care patient room contains anywhere from  to  pieces of medical equipment developed by different manufacturers that rarely talk to one another says peter pronovost senior vice president of patient safety and quality for johns hopkins medicine and director of the armstrong institute we are excited to collaborate with microsoft to bring interoperability to these medical devices to fully realize the benefits of technology and provide better care to our patients and their families by combining teamwork with technology designed to meet patients and clinicians needs we can make care safer less expensive and more joyful four million patients are admitted to icus in the us each year and between  and  patients die annually from a potentially preventable complication making medical errors the third leading cause of death behind heart disease and cancer in collaboration with microsoft johns hopkins plans to revamp project emerge to better serve patients in intensive care environments johns hopkins will supply the clinical expertise for the build while microsoft will provide advanced technologies including azure cloud platform and services as well as software development expertise using azure the improved solution will collect and integrate information from several modern devices and provide critical analytics computing database mobility networking storage and web functions the final product will allow physicians to see trends in a patients care in one centralized location and let them access critical patient information from any hospitalapproved windows device pilot projects are estimated to begin in  johns hopkins and microsoft share a common vision of providing better care to more people says michael robinson vice president of us health and life sciences at microsoft through our joint work johns hopkins and microsoft will empower health professionals with easytoconsume datadriven insights allowing them to focus more on patients and less on technology and process this initiative is one of several collaborations between the two organizations designed to foster innovative healthbased technologies earlier this year microsoft became a sponsor of fastforward johns hopkins new business
