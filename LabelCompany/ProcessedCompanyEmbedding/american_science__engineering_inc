million stock exchanges nasdaqticker symbol aseinaic  irradiation apparatus manufacturing american science  engineering inc ase is a bostonarea company that develops manufactures and markets xray inspection systems as well as providing maintenance and training services the systems are used around the world at border crossings ports airports military bases and corporate and government mailrooms to help combat terrorism illegal immigration and drug and weapon smuggling ases product lines include parcelsearch featuring a small tunnel system used to inspect mail and luggage as well as larger opentunnel systems to screen larger bags and small cargo the cargosearch line is used to inspect palletized cargo air and sea cargo containers and vehicles it can also be outfitted with radioactive threat detection technology the companys smartcheck system is used to inspect people for both metal and nonmetal contraband including drugs weapons and explosives key to ase systems is the companys patented z backscatter technology which detects and highlights items that contain low atomic number elements socalled low z materials such as carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen found in plastic weapons explosives and drugs z backscatter also detects high z materials such as metal weapons as a result ase systems are able to simultaneously screen for both metal and nonmetal materials a key element of z backscatter systems is the companys patented flying spot technology which instead of the fanlike beam of traditional xray systems relies on a more narrow focused beam separate detectors can then translate the information on a pair of television monitors one showing lowz materials and the other highz materials it also produces photolike images and emits low amounts of radiation major customers for ase include the department of homeland security and the military ase is a public company listed on the nasdaq companys founding in  ase was founded in cambridge massachusetts in  by yearold dr martin annis who had earned a phd from the massachusetts institute of technology seven years earlier after teaching for four years he became the head of physical science at allied research in boston doing department of defense contract research on the effects of nuclear explosions following a disagreement with management he struck out on his own with the help of mit professor of physics george w clark a friend and former graduate school colleague who served as a consultant as well as an investor annis set up a private research firm he called american science  engineering other initial investors were chemist carolus m cobb accountant h s richardson jr and sol horwitz general manager of bostons west end iron works together they collected  in funds and set up operations in a threeroom office located above a bank in cambridge massachusetts the company started out with a department of defense contract similar to what annis had done at allied research investigating the effects of a nuclear explosion above the atmosphere the business had come through the air force cambridge research laboratory afcrl which had funded his previous work and had been pleased with his results annis would soon convince bruno rossi an mit professor of physics who had once taught annis to serve as chairman and ase chief scientific adviser rossi had been one of the scientists involved in the manhattan project which resulted in the worlds first nuclear weapon he was eager to steer the company away from defense contracts and suggested ase develop and produce high school physics kits to accompany the curriculum that was being developed at mit at the time rossi himself had written part of the programs textbook through his influence ase was able to secure a deal to produce the kits that would be distributed across the country by the mcgrawhill book company as a result ase moved to larger accommodations rossi would also have another idea for ase one that would have longer term implications for the company and the field of physics in general while flying home from a conference rossi received a major insight about the soft xray portion of the spectrum which he became convinced could provide a window into the universe to reveal things never before known because mits cosmic ray group was too busy to pursue this new avenue of inquiry rossi turned to annis and convinced him to have ase conduct research on largearea xray detectors and pursue ways to focus soft xrays thus laying the foundation for xray astronomy annis was eager to find nondefenserelated research projects and agreed to pursue rossis idea he further suggested that the man to implement such an idea was riccardo giacconi an italianborn physicist in  giacconi joined ase and created an xray astronomy team for the next  years giacconis team made a succession of pioneering discoveries and developments in the field of xray technology giacconi left ase in  even without giacconi ase continued to make key scientific advances in  it launched the nasafunded einstein observatory the largest xray telescope in the world a year later the company designed a special xray telescope for nasa used to study the sun and planets during the s ase was also looking for the commercial success that came from applied research activities in  the company patented its flying spot technology which was then employed to develop precursors to the companys presentday line of xray screening systems during the s ase became involved in electric utility loan management research the latter resulted in the  introduction of asep a system that allowed utilities to automatically conduct remote meter reading asep would become a major source of revenues for ase through the s the first personnel xray inspection system called microdose was introduced in  a year later the company received funding from pfizer medical systems to develop a medical microdose system going public in  ase also became a public company in  and gained a listing on the american stock exchange filings with the securities and exchange commission indicate that ase was involved in some ventures that did not pan out in  for example it acquired package house inc of clifton new jersey a business that was discontinued ten years later in  american science  engineering international inc was formed only to be dissolved in  furthermore the filings indicate that ase sold an education division in  ase introduced the microdose xray system model  used to screen carryon luggage at airports and the multipurpose model  used to inspect luggage and parcels other versions of the system soon followed the model  to inspect letters and small parcels and the model  for large parcels and baggage inspection in  revenues totaled  million company perspectives ase specializes in detection technologies that can uncover dangerous and elusive threats including explosives plastic and metal weapons and radioactive devices such as dirty bombs and nuclear wmd these xray systems are deployed worldwide at ports and borders and military and highthreat facilities in  ase unveiled its z series of xray systems using flying spot technology receiving a good deal of attention fortune magazine for example profiled the  z system which it said could detect the glock  pistol mostly constructed of plastic and the latest terrorist weapon to menace air travelers around the world explaining how the new system worked fortune s eleanor johnson tracy wrote that as the flying spot beam strikes the suitcase separate detectors display different images simultaneously on two television monitors one screen shows the highdensity materials—for example a radio and a traveling case the other reveals the plastic handle of a glock  hidden beside the radio ase continued to conduct aerospace research in the s in  it won a contract to build an inspection system for the trident d solid rocket motors and in  it teamed up with the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics to develop a highresolution xray image detector which nasa would choose as its contribution to the rosat a german xray astronomy satellite however with reductions in nasas budget and the end of the cold war which resulted in defense department cutbacks ase became increasingly dependent on its commercial xray screening products used to fight smuggling and terrorism despite having the federal aviation administration ordering  airports to install ase systems to screen luggage ase was struggling at the start of the s in may  the company was forced to implement a number of cost containment measures including a  percent reduction in staff ase experienced mixed results in the first half of the s on the one hand it achieved a number of successes in  the company unveiled the predecessor to the cargosearch product line with the tosi xray inspection system first used by the us government to ensure the soviet union was in compliance with the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty by screen missiles loaded on russian railcars a narcoticsdetection system was introduced in  and was purchased by us customs and a year later several new products were put on the market including cargosearch bodysearch mailsearch and lobbysearch moreover in  ase won a contract from the advanced research projects agency to develop the mobilesearch systems which would be used at the mexico border to detect both narcotics and illegal immigrants however this period would also bring financial difficulties due to a struggling economy and controversy involving its founder ousting the founder in  annis who had served as president since the beginning added a new title chief executive officer in april  the board over which he presided as chairman also was increased in size to seven and just four months later in july  that board terminated his employment according to a securities and exchange commission sec filing this action was taken on the basis of information received indicating that annis had been engaging in activities that were incompatible with his status as an officer and employee of the company annis sued the company and its directors alleging wrongful termination of employment a trial was held and when it was concluded in april  a jury determined that annis had materially breached his fiduciary duty to ase as a result the company was found to be justified in terminating his employment annis continued to feud with his former company however in addition to unsuccessfully appealing the  decision he would be accused of passing along trade secrets to ase rival egg inc he also formed a new xray technology company annistech and he and ase engaged in litigation over the ownership rights of certain technology this matter was settled in june  ases rights were affirmed and it also gained rights to some ongoing developments by annis although it agreed to license back the technology to annistech key dates  the company is founded by martin annis  dr riccardo giacconi heads the exray astronomy team  giacconi leaves the company  the company is taken public  z backscatter technology is introduced  annis is ousted as ceo and chairman  giacconi wins the nobel prize  the company gains a nasdaq listing replacing annis at ase in september  was ralph s sheridan who for the past four years had been operating his own massachusetts consulting and investment firm a graduate of ohio state university he held a bachelors degree in chemistry and an mba and had executive experience at combustion engineering inc and hec energy corp he initiated a turnaround strategy that caused pain in the short run sales dropped from  million in  to  million in  but rebounded to  million in  when the company returned to profitability sheridan took over a company that was a contract research house and a parcel xray company under his leadership ase focused exclusively on providing xray imaging solutions mostly catering to government agencies dealing with security smuggling and trade crime further restructuring occurred in the second half of the s as the company increased its focus on dealing with the problems of drugs and weapons smuggling terrorism and trade fraud sales reached  million in  and grew steadily over the next few years due in large measure to overseas sales in  the company sold its first system to an international customer located in the middle east domestically concern over illegal immigration spurred business as well and the companys new backscatter technology proved adept at the job sales increased to  million in  and  million in  as the companys international client base continued to expand with systems sold in abu dhabi bahrain egypt and south africa the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   raised the profile of ase as demand for security products increased dramatically but according to business week ase was left in the dust the companys skyhigh production costs forced it to price products at premiums many customers refused to pay and ase had only one salesperson although sales increased to  million in  ase recorded a profit of only  to make matters worse at a time when the company should have been thriving revenues dipped to  million in  and  million in  and the company lost about  million during that time in may  sheridan after a decade at the helm was removed as ceo with the company on the verge of being sold a new ceo was hired anthony fabiano the former president and chief operating officer at minnesotabased dispatch industries designer of industrial ovens and furnaces he also served three years as a vicepresident at another minnesota company aerospace and defense company alliant techsystems he quickly assessed the problem at ase telling business week we had these geewhiz products and no way to get them into the marketplace while building up the sales and marketing staff he also brought in lean manufacturing practices that cut the production time on some systems from three months to as little as three weeks costs came down and the company was able to competitively price its advanced systems moreover ase was now better able to market its products more aggressively to target customers law enforcement and the military the companys stock was moved from the american stock exchange to the nasdaq providing greater visibility with investors revenues improved to  million in  and the company turned a profit of more than  million the following year sales increased to  million and net income to  million although  million of that total was the result of ase selling off its high energy systems division sales almost doubled in  to  million and net income soared to  million lean and focused the company appeared to be well
