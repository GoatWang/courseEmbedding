napier ventures inc has entered into an asset purchase agreement with emerald copper corp whereby the company will acquire a percent interest in  unpatented mining claims in mohave county arizona as well as  unpatented mining claims in dolores county colorado napier plans to focus on the emerald isle property the emerald isle property is located entirely on federal bureau of land managementmanaged lands on unpatented mining claims situated in mohave county arizona the mine is about  miles north of kingman ariz and about  miles west of the mineral park copper porphyry considerable exploration has been done at the emerald isle property in the past by several companies including el paso mining and milling company arimetco st genevieve resources ltd and sierra resources group inc historical mining at the emerald isle property was of highgrade oxide copper by underground methods followed by a small openpit copper recovery by leaching and electrowinning past production is estimated by the us bureau of mines at  million tonnes averaging  per cent copper in march  roscoe postle associates inc prepared a mineral resource estimate for st genevieve in accordance with national instrument  which provided indicated mineral resources of the emerald isle copper deposit as  million tonnes with an average grade of  per cent total copper based on compilation of  drill holes totalling in excess of  feet a total copper cutoff grade of  per cent total copper and foot minimum vertical thickness napier is not aware of any more recent mineral resource estimates no qualified person has done sufficient work to classify the mineral resource estimate in the roscoe technical report as current mineral resources and napier is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource geology copper mineralization at the emerald isle property is hosted by late tertiary conglomerates and to a lesser extent by quaternary alluvium and cretaceous granitic rocks mineralization at emerald isle property is in the form of mineralized lenses contained within a paleochannel approximately a few thousand feet long and up to  feet wide the source of copper at the emerald isle property is interpreted to be the lowgrade porphyrytype copper mineralization at alum wash about  miles northeast of the emerald isle property deposit or the mineralized intrusion directly underlying the property the mineralization is characterized by dark blue to black copper oxide and carbonatecemented conglomerate rock similar to the exotica deposit a satellite of the chuquicamata copper deposit in chile there is a welldefined oxide copper zone on the property at the base of the gila conglomerate or fanglomerate this zone long hypothesized to originate from the alum wash area is uphill and to the northeast of the emerald isle pit what is not generally known is that many of the previous drill holes at emerald isle end in altered or unaltered tertiaryage or cretaceousage intrusive material loosely termed porphyry and that many of these drill holes stop in what could be economic grades of mineralization also based on limited geological descriptions many holes were stopped prematurely in mineralized conglomerate thus there could be a large local porphyry copper deposit immediately underlying part of the drilled area although the mineralized intrusive may be cut off to the north of the pit the southwest and northwest limits of mineralized intrusion have not been found essentially there is a large mineralized porphyry system immediately underlying the oxide channel in the conglomerates and this porphyry though low grade covers an area roughly  feet by  feet open in several directions while the foot drill hole completed in  did not intersect significant mineralization anomalous copper cadmium and zinc were noted in the analysis of the chips claim dispute sierra resource group inc  which also holds claims in the area was a usbased exploration and mining company which previously had an percent ownership of its emerald isle property mining claims sierra is based in las vegas nev and as of june  was placed into bankruptcy as part of the bankruptcy process certain assets of sierra were purchased from a receiver by sunburst minerals llc sunburst is asserting ownership of certain claims that overlap with the emerald isle property claims as a result the status of claims once held by sierra is uncertain and litigation is in process napier and its consultants have examined numerous claim posts belonging to the vendor in the field and believe them to be properly staked napier engaged a consultant to undertake a title review which found numerous defects in the location of many of the former sierra claims napier staked the emerald isle property claims with the blm on the basis of open ground in some areas and the probability that some of the sierra claims particularly the mill site claims are in contravention of one or more clauses of the  mining law as a result of its review napier believes that emerald isle property claims cover a large and partly overlapping portion of the emerald isle property copper deposit and may be explored and developed where they do not conflict with land covered by any valid third party unpatented mining claims napier intends to assert its rights to and explore the emerald isle property with geological mapping and mineral exploration activities conclusions the emerald isle oxide copper property is a property of merit with ni compliant resources and exploration potential at depth as a mineralized porphyry exists under the oxide capping or channels and many drillholes stopped in mineralization while there are some conflicting claims held by others the present author concurs with the mineral surveyors that emerald copper corps claims are validly staked cover a larger and partly overlapping portion of the emerald isle copper deposit and may be explored and developed where they do not conflict with any validly staked and held claims which may coexist   copyright  napier ventures inc porphyry ventures llc  list of ceos

approximately  kilometres by paved road north west of fairbanks alaska seven holes  metres were completed during the summer program as well as additional ground geophysics and geochemical sampling freegolds first diamond drill program in  discovered significant copper–gold mineralization after stepping out from the previous shallow reverse circulation drilling completed by asarco in  and confirmed the copper mineralization extended to depth the  holes extended the copper mineralization intercepted in sc  by over  metres to the southwest and to depth pr dated november th  hole sc  located  metres southwest of sc  intersected  metres grading  copper equivalent hole sc  a further  metres southwest of sc  intercepted  metres grading  copper equivalent with both holes ending in mineralization see press releases september th  and october th  the magnetic anomaly over hill  covers an area measuring  metres by  metres and appears to be directly associated with the mineralization mineralization on hill  was intersected in drill holes to a minimum depth of  metres and remains open in all directions mineralization consists of sulphide quartz stockwork veining and sulphide disseminations within strong secondary biotite alteration and anhydrite primarily situated within a flysch unit intruded by quartz feldspar porphyry sills andor dykes  disseminated and fracturecontrolled pyrite pyrrhotite chalcopyrite arsenopyrite and bornite have been identified along with numerous secondary oxide minerals in drill core in addition to the significant cu au and ag mineralization reported from the  drilling significant tungsten was also intersected in hole sc  which included  ppm w  wo over  metres and in sc  tungsten values averaging  ppm w   wo over  metres including a higher grade interval of  ppm w  wo over  metres five drill holes  m collared on hill  located  km northwest of hill  tested a large magnetic anomaly and a coincident coppermolybdenum soil anomaly the magnetic anomaly strikes northeastsouthwest and covers  metres x  metres to date ground geophysics and soil geochemical surveys have been conducted over a small part   metres of this large magnetic anomaly  the anomaly was tested with  holes spaced approximately  metres apart starting on the western edge of the soil geochemical anomaly each hole intersected both copper and molybdenum mineralization with the copper values increasing as the drilling moved to the northeast coincident with the increased assay values was the increasing amount of quartz feldspar porphyry intersected within both holes sc  and sc  the two most northeastern holes silver values were also elevated in these two holes hole  drilled to a depth of  metres was the most westerly hole drilled and returned  metres grading  copper and  molybdenum hole  was collared approximately  metres to the east and intersected  copper and  molybdenum over its entire  metres length hole  was an angle hole drilled to southeast aimed at testing the ip chargeability anomaly and encountered abundant fault gauge and broken rock with anomalous values throughout the hole hole sc  intersected quartzfeldspar porphyry with a coincident higher grade interval including  copper and  molybdenum from  to  metres and returned  copper and  molybdenum over the entire  metres hole sc  intersected  copper and  molybdenum from  metres including  copper and  molybdenum from  metres within quartzfeldspar porphyry  the entire hole averaged  copper and  molybdenum over the entire  metre length a long section showing the holes with the assay values is below of particular significance is the presence of consistent mineralization throughout each hole along strike and in the increasing grade to the northeast freegold has not as yet collected sufficient data to determine how the downhole drill intervals might relate to the actual true thickness of mineralization the  drill program successfully confirmed the presence of a coppergoldmolybdenum porphyry system at shorty creek project with an alterationmineralization footprint that covers an area of approximately  km in diameter  the airborne magnetic survey has identified a number of northeast trending magnetic highs coppergoldmolybdenum mineralization and associated porphyry alteration has been intersected in drill holes at hills  and   four additional
