classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase order and the price that rosland capital actually pays for the products purchased by customer under such purchase order is known as the spread and it is stated as a percentage of the purchase price

business units brewer  replaced brian cornell as president and ceo of sam’s club in february   by mille alderman photography courtesy of walmart brewer joined walmart as regional vice president in  overseeing operations in georgia from  to january  she was division president of the southeast most recently she was executive vice president and president of walmart east a territory that includes nearly  stores in six regions — spanning from maine to puerto rico now she’s head of a company with locations worldwide sam’s club which accounts for about  percent of walmart’s annual sales with a revenue of  billion has outperformed its namesake stores as brewer took the stage at the th annual walmart shareholders meeting in june she celebrated the company’s seven quarters of consecutive increases and announced the first quarter this year was the highest in eight years “sam walton made history by changing retail over the past  years” she said at the meeting “but now it’s our turn for the next  years” brewer born the same year as sam walton opened his first store in rogers was raised in michigan as the youngest of five she and her siblings were the first generation to go to college her parents funded her education with a combination of student loans and scholarships brewer earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from spelman college in atlanta founded in  spelman has since held the distinction of being america’s oldest historically black college for women and is accredited as a global leader in the education of women of african descent brewer said she chose to serve as chair of the board of trustees at spelman because of her genuine love for her alma mater and personal interest in investing in the education of africanamerican women one of her most exciting duties as chair was presenting the spelman national community service award to oprah winfrey at the  commencement ceremony brewer continued her education by attending the advanced management program at the wharton school and graduated from director’s college at the university of chicago school of businessstanford school of law straight out of school at the age of  brewer worked for kimberlyclark corp starting as a scientist in nonwoven technology and product development before becoming president of the global nonwovens sector in  as vice president of the nonwoven fabrics business rosalind revitalized an underperforming business unit and grew sales by more than  percent after  years at kimberly clark in atlanta she’s now settled in northwest arkansas brewer is married to john who she met while studying at spelman and he was at morehouse the couple has two children and john is a former investment banker who became a stayathome dad why were you interested in studying chemistry i was convinced i wanted to be a physician and i had always done well in math and science as a child once i learned that i am a weenie when it comes to blood and grieving it changed my direction how has your education shaped your career my education shaped my career by teaching me discipline college for me required focus determination independence and drive my coursework at the end was grueling most importantly my chemistryscience background has been key to my ability to problem solve what has been your greatest career achievement joining walmart after a year career with my first and only company after graduating from college my agility dedication to be a student of the business and the success i achieved in the role surprised me i loved my career at kimberly clark and never thought i would leave what led you to walmart and has made you want to stay walmart is a phenomenon in my mind it is a rare company that allows you to impact many lives and many issues there is no other employer in the world like this today we provide opportunities that maybe only the military can compete with what lessons have you brought from other positions into your new role as ceo how to lead change i have learned how to problem identify create the team and draw the roadmaps as my career has progressed i have taught others that i lead how to do this it’s a successful formula and tool set for leaders what core belief of sam walton’s do you admire most and why “if you take care of the associate the associate will take care of the customer” i truly believe in treating people the way i want to be treated and that’s with respect and honest intentions whenever i am true to this success happens for me the business and the company what is the best business advice you’ve ever received or you’ve ever given be agile but never compromise core values no matter the immediate pressure for results strategies must change over time as  business conditions migrate keep your ego under control you are not the business you’re just the leader at the time boards chair of board of trustees for spelman college elected  board chair since  director of molson coors brewing company  to  board of directors

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase order and the price that rosland capital actually pays for the products purchased by customer under such purchase order is known as the spread and it is stated as a percentage of the purchase price

completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
