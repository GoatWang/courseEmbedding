inappropriate recommendations and selling investments in icon leasing fund eleven llc and icon leasing fund twelve llc to them even though they would not be able to withstand the high risks the two funds are registered nontraded equipment leasing direct participation programs dpps not only are the icon eleven and icon twelve investments very high risk and illiquid investments but also there are little if any secondary markets where their shares can be sold investment dividends from icon cannot be predicted because they are contingent upon profits made from equipment leases during their offering periods the two funds started paying distributions however not long after icon eleven and twelve stopped taking new investors the investments’ value started to drop fast and dividend payments became inconsistent the decline has resulted in significant financial losses for investors in one quarterly report from almost a year ago icon leasing fund twelve noted that its liabilities are far greater than its assets sec documents from the end of  show that icon eleven’s estimated per share value was  which is a more than  decline in share value meantime as investors have sustained losses icon investments purportedly gave financial firms and their investment advisers among the biggest commissions for alternative products the icon leasing fund eleven and icon leasing fund twelve have been accused of using just  of investors’ money to buy actual equipment while  of these funds went toward fees commissions and expenses also regulator filings reveal that icon funds reserved the right to buy shares for affiliates and officers at a discount this approach would have earned higher returns for iconrelated entities while the value of investors’ shares would have been harmed if you are

are registered nontraded equipment leasing direct participation programs dpps although registered with the us securities and exchange commission dpps are not found on public exchanges their lack of an active secondary market makes it hard for retail investors to independently assess the prices charged for these investments detecting fraud can also be harder with equipment leasing dpps a sponsor sells units of limited partnership the substantial offering costs are subtracted while the rest of the money made is invested in a pool of equipment leases that were leveraged by more borrowing this type of dpp touts a reliable income stream however a substantial number of the distributions that are given to investors are not income but a return of capital and while partners may market the tax benefits such as depreciation deductions and interest payment on borrowing employed to leverage to investors these benefits can only be applied to offset income from other passive investments often investors will get less than what they originally put into equipment leasing dpps recently icon leasing investors were told that the company would no longer pay dividends on certain funds a number of brokerage firms have been accused of not telling investors about the risks involved investors have also accused icon of failing to do the necessary due diligence before selling this type of equipment

managers discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k statements made in this section may be considered forwardlooking these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially because of these risks and assumptions please refer to part i forwardlooking statements located elsewhere in this annual report on form k overview we operate as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our members invested was pooled together to make investments pay fees and establish a small reserve we primarily acquire equipment subject to lease purchase equipment and lease it to third parties provide equipment and other financing and to a lesser degree acquire ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration some of our equipment leases are acquired for cash and are expected to provide current cash flow which we refer to as income leases for our other equipment leases we finance the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties we refer to these leases as growth leases these growth leases generate little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments received from the lessee are used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease for these leases we anticipate that the future value of the leased equipment will exceed our cash portion of the purchase price our manager manages and controls our business affairs including but not limited to our equipment leases and other financing transactions under the terms of our llc agreement we are currently in our operating period which will end on april   after having been extended for two years during our operating period additional investments were made with the cash generated from our investments to the extent that the cash was not needed for expenses reserves and distributions to members the investment in additional equipment leases and other financing transactions in this manner is called reinvestment we will commence our liquidation period on may   which we expect to continue for approximately one year current business environment recent trends indicate that domestic and global equipment financing volume is correlated to overall business investments in equipment which are typically impacted by general economic conditions as the economy slows or builds momentum the demand for productive equipment generally slows or builds and equipment financing volume generally decreases or increases depending on a number of factors these factors include the availability of liquidity to provide equipment financing andor provide it on terms satisfactory to borrowers lessees and other counterparties as well as the desire to upgrade equipment andor expand operations during times of growth but also in times of recession in order to among other things seize the opportunity to obtain competitive advantage over distressed competitors andor increase business as the economy recovers table of contents our manager believes the us economy is likely to continue its gradual recovery with the pace of economic growth increasing through  due to factors such as the rate of employment expansion and greater certainty with respect to us tax and budget policies significant transactions we engaged in the following significant transactions during the years ended december   and  aframax product tankers on may   we sold the senang spirit for

had guaranteed ears lease obligations the icon ear entities have had the new york state supreme court judgments recognized in illinois where the principals live but do not currently anticipate being

misrepresentation on may   the case was settled in the icon ear entities favor for  of which our portion was approximately  on october   the chapter  bankruptcy trustee for ear filed an adversary complaint against icon ear seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleges were fraudulently transferred from ear to icon ear the complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by ear to icon ear during the day period preceding ears bankruptcy filing alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the us bankruptcy code additionally the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that icon ear received as security in connection with its investment our manager filed an answer to the complaint which included certain affirmative defenses our manager believes these claims are frivolous and intends to vigorously defend this action at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of this action or loss therefrom subsequent to the filing of the bankruptcy petition ear disclaimed any right to its equipment and such equipment became the subject of an illinois state court proceeding the equipment was subsequently sold as part of the illinois state court proceeding on march   one of the creditors in the illinois state court proceeding won a summary judgment motion filed against

topic  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income which requires an entity to disclose information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component on the respective line items of net loss income the adoption of asu  became effective for us on january   and did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in march  the fasb issued asu no  parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity which clarifies guidance to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment when an entity sells all or part of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity we are required to adopt asu  on january   which is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies an understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires our manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates primarily include the determination of credit loss reserves impairment losses deferred tax valuation allowances estimated useful lives and residual values actual results could differ from those estimates we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our business  lease classification and revenue recognition  asset impairments  depreciation  notes receivable and revenue recognition table of contents  credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve  derivative financial instruments and  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or liabilities lease classification and revenue recognition each equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease based upon the terms of each lease the estimated residual value is a critical component of and can directly influence the determination as to whether a lease is classified as an operating or a finance lease our manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction as part of its process the investment committee determines the estimated residual value if any to be used once the investment has been approved the factors considered in determining the residual value include but are not limited to the creditworthiness of the potential lessee the type of equipment considered how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessees business the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment review policy the residual value assumes among other things that the asset is utilized normally in an open unrestricted and stable market shortterm fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets if held in quantity simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly the residual value is calculated using information from various external sources such as trade publications auction data equipment dealers wholesalers and industry experts as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators for finance leases we capitalize at lease inception the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment at lease termination and the initial direct costs related to the lease less unearned income unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value minus the cost of the leased equipment unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method for operating leases rental income is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term billed operating lease receivables are included in accounts receivable until collected or written off we record a reserve if we deem any receivable not collectible the difference between the timing of the cash received and the income recognized on a straightline basis is recognized as either deferred revenue or other assets as appropriate initial direct costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term asset impairments the significant assets in our portfolio are periodically reviewed no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair market value if there is an indication of impairment we will estimate the future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows if an impairment is determined to exist the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a longlived asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income in the period the determination is made the events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are i the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than its carrying value or ii the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the asset the preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates including the level of future rents the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset estimated downtime between releasing events and the amount of releasing costs our managers review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators including thirdparty appraisals published values for similar assets recent transactions for similar assets adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset depreciation table of contents we record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease in order to calculate depreciation we first determine the depreciable base which is the equipment cost less the estimated residual value at lease termination depreciation expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the lease term notes receivable and revenue recognition notes receivable are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance plus costs incurred to originate loans net of any unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans we use the effective interest rate method to recognize finance income which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the investment unearned income discounts and premiums are amortized to finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income using the effective interest rate method interest receivable related to the unpaid principal is recorded separately from the outstanding balance in our consolidated balance sheets upon the prepayment of a note receivable any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of finance income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income credit quality of notes receivable and finance leases and credit loss reserve our manager weighs all credit decisions based on a combination of external credit ratings as well as internal credit evaluations of all borrowers a borrowers credit is analyzed using those credit ratings as well as the borrowers financial statements and other financial data deemed relevant as our financing receivables generally finance leases and notes receivable are limited in number our manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio based metrics and credit loss reserve financing receivables are analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or nonperforming based on payment history if a financing receivable becomes nonperforming due to a borrowers missed scheduled payments or failed financial covenants our manager analyzes whether a credit loss reserve should be established or whether the financing receivable should be restructured material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held notes receivable are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when payments are more than  days past due additionally our manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than  days and based upon our managers judgment these accounts may be placed in a nonaccrual status in accordance with the cost recovery method payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal if collection of the principal of nonaccrual loans is not in doubt interest income is recognized on a cash basis loans in nonaccrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable when our manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a nonperforming note receivable we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary this analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the note or the collateral value of the asset underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent if it is determined that the impaired value of the nonperforming note receivable is less than the net carrying value we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing
