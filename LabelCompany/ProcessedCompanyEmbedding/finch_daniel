curriculumthe product modelalso referred to as the behavioural objectives modelbecame apparent in the late s due to the vagueness of many syllabuses the need to specify practical skills more precisely the need to make assessment techniques more precise the influence of the ideas of behaviourismhowever this was also developed by tyler  he shared his emphasis on rationality and relative simplicityhis theory was based on  fundamental questions what educational purposes should the school seek to attain what educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes how can these educational experiences be effectively organized how can we determine whether these purposes are being attainedit used to be that there were certain skills to master and facts to know knowledge was seen as something similar to a product that is manufactured generally one starts knowing nothing is taught and one transmits that knowledge to action for the most part this point of view worked for quite some time as it organized learning quite neatlythere were a series of steps leading to the product and curriculum could be designed accordingly those steps werestep  diagnosis of needstep  formulation of objectivesstep  selection of contentstep  organization of contentstep  selection of learning experiencesstep  organization of learning experiencesstep  determination of what to evaluate and the ways and means of doing itconcernone problem with the product orientation is that students are generally left out of the picture the product model by having a prespecified plan or program tends to direct attention to teaching for example the focus is on how the information is givenif this model is tightly adhered to there can be limited opportunities for educators to make use of the interactions that occur it can also deskill the educatorstherefore it turns educators into technicianspositivesthe advantages of the use of behavioural objectives in curriculum planning may include avoidance of vague general statements of intent making assessment more precise helping to select and structure contentthe product model of curriculum developmentthe product model has its origins in the writings of ralph tyler tyler’s basic principles of curriculum instruction  greatly influenced curriculum development in america this model is also known as an objectives curriculum model and looks at curriculum as a technical exercise key features of this model include high level of lecturerteacher planning emphasis on definingsetting appropriate learning objectives use of behavioural language precise assessment instruments emphasis plans and intentions – selecting and organising of learningexperiences the curriculum essentially is a set of documents for implementation onesizefitsall package of learning outcomes product are measured – evaluationsummarythe curriculum as product model id heavily dependant on the setting of behavioural objectivestherefore the curriculum is essentially a set of documents for implementationin other words curriculum is what actually happens in the classroom and what people do to prepare and evaluatefull transcriptmore

find what you were looking formagnifying glasshelpful reviews john rex wier ii mdjuless rateddr wier is a great psychiatrist but i will be leaving his care due to his receptionist she has been not just short but flat out rude and insensitive called me names and has gone so far as to hang up on me without ever asking why i was calling i have never met someone that treated people with such disregard in my entire life she has no business being in the health care industry especially one that deals with people that are already unstable it seems as if her sole goal is make people cry or snap she will not connect you to the doctor and belittles you when you show up for an appointment i know i am not the only one that has had to deal with this i urge all of you to voice your concerns to dr wier his other receptionist is great i have no idea why he hired this additional woman but she needs to go before all his patients do it is a shame to have to lose a doctor you really admire and trust because dealing with this woman is unbearableas for dr wier he is a great psychiatrist he really works with you to find a treatment that works for you if you have already found medication that works for you and are just switching doctors he listens reads your files and doesnt make you restart the whole process which in changing health insurance companies i ran into that problem a lot with doctors wanting to start the diagnose process all over rather than listening to what has and has not helped you in the past his appointments are a little shorter than some as he seems to deal more with people that have seen a psychiatrist for years and are already set with a treatment plan or are also in other forms of therapy but if you do need additional time just to talk you can schedule it and he will gladly listen to you and help he is very caring compassionate and understanding i know some people at times need to just be able to talk for a hour or more and if you need that additional
