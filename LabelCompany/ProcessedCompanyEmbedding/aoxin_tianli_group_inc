business declined in the first quarter as a result of decreases in both the number of hogs sold and the average selling price per hog the decrease in the number of hogs sold was mainly related to our

sale in the first quarter additionally we saw downward trend for hog prices that started in the fourth quarter of  and continued into this year we believe this was related to the fact that a number of
