foundations top rating in its annual corporate equality index the company trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol mlhr herman millers products are sold internationally through whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including the united kingdom canada france germany italy japan mexico australia singapore china hong kong india brazil and the netherlands the companys products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships or joint ventures with customers in over  countries the company is globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations in the united states manufacturing operations are located in michigan georgia wisconsin and north carolina in europe its manufacturing presence is located within the united kingdom manufacturing operations in asia include facilities located in dongguan and ningbo china and a new manufacturing facility in india opened this year the company manufactures products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller performance system hmps herman miller strives to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand accordingly production is orderdriven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand the standard lead time for the majority of our products is  to  days these factors result in a high rate of inventory turns related to our manufactured inventories a key element of the companys manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers this strategy has allowed the company to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage as a result of this strategy our manufacturing operations are largely assemblybased the business is comprised of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap the operating segments are determined on the basis of how the company internally reports and evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions the company has identified the following reportable segments north american furniture solutions  includes the operations associated with the design manufacture and sale of furniture products for workrelated settings including office education and healthcare environments throughout the united states and canada the north american furniture solutions reportable segment is the aggregation of two operating segments in addition the company has determined that both operating segments within the north american furniture solutions reportable segment represent reporting units ela furniture solutions  ela furniture solutions includes the operations associated with the design manufacture and sale of furniture products primarily for workrelated settings in the emea latin america and asiapacific geographic regions specialty  includes the operations associated with design manufacture and sale of highcraft furniture products and textiles including geiger wood products maharam textiles and herman miller collection products consumer  includes the operations associated with the sale of modern design furnishings and accessories to third party retail distributors as well as direct to consumer sales through ecommerce direct mailing catalogs and dwr studios the company also reports a corporate category consisting primarily of unallocated corporate expenses including restructuring impairment acquisitionrelated costs and other unallocated corporate costs   core strengths portfolio of leading brands  herman miller is a globallyrecognized authentic brand known for working with some of the most outstanding designers in the world within the industries in which the company operates herman miller dwr geiger maharam posh nemschoff and colbrook bosson saunders cbs are acknowledged as leading brands that inspire architects and designers to create their best design solutions this portfolio has enabled herman miller to connect with new audiences channels geographies and product categories leveraging the companys brand equity across the lines of business is an important element of the companys business strategy problemsolving design and innovation  the company is committed to developing researchbased functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and has a history of doing so in collaboration with a global network of leading independent designers the company believes its skills and experience in matching problemsolving design with the workplace needs of customers provides the company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace an important component of the companys business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research design and development the company accomplishes this through the use of an internal research and engineering staff that engages with third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis operational excellence  the company was among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations the company is committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency the company has extended this lean process work to its nonmanufacturing processes as well as externally to our manufacturing supply chain and distribution channel the company believes these concepts hold significant promise for further gains in reliability quality and efficiency leading networks  the company values relationships in all areas of the business the company considers its network of innovative designers owned and independent dealers and suppliers to be among the most important competitive factors and vital to the longterm success of the business multichannel reach  the company has built a unique multichannel distribution capability that it considers unique through contract furniture dealers direct customer sales retail studios ecommerce catalogs and independent retailers the company serves contract and residential customers across a range of channels and geographies channels of distribution independent and owned contract furniture dealers  most of the companys product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world these dealers purchase the companys products and distribute them to end customers the company recognizes revenue on product sales through this channel once products are shipped and title passes to the dealer many of these dealers also offer furniturerelated services including product installation at may   the company owned two contract furniture dealerships one of which has operations in multiple locations the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as intercompany transactions from our consolidated financial results the company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete the company believes independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally the best model for a financially strong distribution network with this in mind the companys strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition the remaining owned dealerships to independent owners where possible the goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions direct customer sales  the company also sells products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the us federal government in most of these instances the company contracts separately with a dealership or thirdparty installation company to provide salesrelated services the company recognizes revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete dwr retail studios  at the end of fiscal  dwr had  retail studios and two outlet locations located in metropolitan areas throughout north america revenue on sales from these studios is recognized upon delivery to the end customer   ecommerce  the company sells products through its online stores in which products are available for sale via the companys website hermanmillercom as well as through the dwr online store dwrcom these sites complement our existing methods of distribution and extend the companys brand to new customers the company recognizes revenue on these sales either upon shipment of the product or for sales through the dwr online store upon product delivery to the end customer dwr directmail catalogs  the companys consumer business unit utilizes a directmail catalog program through its dwr subsidiary a regular schedule of catalog mailings is maintained throughout the fiscal year and these serve as a key driver of sales across each of dwrs channels including retail studios and ecommerce websites revenue on sales transacted through this catalog program is recognized upon product delivery to the end customer independent retailers  certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer challenges ahead avenues of future growth globalization  demographics  demographic shifts in the global workforce are significantly changing how and where value creation happens not only has the millennial generation overtaken the majority representation of the workforce but economies that once relied on industrial production are increasingly becoming driven by knowledge work inherently global  seamlessly digital  the ubiquity of technology allows people to connect with other people content work businesses and ideas wherever and whenever they want this means the way people work is changing where people work is changing and how people work with each other is changing the era of ideas  with the ongoing optimization of industrial production and information sharing the demand for more innovative business solutions increases the global focus of work is shifting to the successful generation and deployment of new ideas as creativity and idea generation drive greater value  people not process provide the distinguishing capability in this shift workplaces are fundamentally changing from standardized and processdriven designs to diverse places that harness human capability creativity and relationships over the past several years herman miller has deployed a strategy to grow the business by shifting its focus in four fundamental areas in response to these changes through these shifts the company believes it is positioned to take advantage of existing markets explore growth opportunities in new markets with supportive demographics increase demand by addressing unmet needs and expand into areas that yield higher prospects for margins and profitability the four fundamental shifts are described below from product centric to solutions  the first strategic shift is to move from a product centric focus to one based upon delivering broader solutions to customers herman miller is retooling its core business to speak to customers with fresh insights to spur new demand and to change the game with unique solutions and services from north america centric to global  the second shift in our strategy aims to transform the business into a truly global organization herman miller has a solid existing customer base but sees meaningful opportunity in emerging markets with supportive demographics the company is positioning itself to take maximum advantage of these shifts from the office to everywhere  the third fundamental strategic shift is moving from the office to everywhere herman miller envisions continued leadership and viability in the contract furniture industry but also sees distinct targeted opportunities through focused market segmentation the company envisions a total offering for customers to enable a lifestyle of purpose   from industry brand to industry  consumer brand  the fourth shift in strategy involves the companys ambition to expand the connection of its powerful brand more directly with the consumers of its products with a legacy of decades of design leadership herman miller is a brand that people desire and want to know the company envisions a business that harnesses its brand vision to pull consumers to it this year the company has added one additional shift  product marketing to pull marketing  that it believes is required in order to reach the full velocity of its intended transformation in other words the company believes that this additional shift will put its strategy into overdrive which is what the strategy has been named herman miller intends to grow in targeted ways first the company will invest in areas that increase its existing markets across focused customer segments such as healthcare education small and medium business and consumer second it will expand into emerging geographic markets that offer growth potential based upon their supportive demographics third it will continue to invest in innovative products which has been a hallmark of its success for many years finally the company will grow through targeted acquisitions industry analysis the company analyzes bifma statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of its contract business in north america and also to that of its competitors the timing of large projectbased business may affect comparisons to this data in any one period finally bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information which the company uses internally as one of several considerations in its short and longrange planning process after many years of compiling and reporting member production data for the us market bifma is revising its data collection process in an attempt to better reflect contract furniture production throughout north america including products manufactured in canada and mexico prior to this change products manufactured in canada or mexico and shipped to the us were excluded from bifmas estimate of industry shipments and orders the new methodology is designed to provide a better reflection of the market as a whole especially given the rise in competition based in canada and mexico as well as sourcing moves by the companys existing competitors additionally bifma has revised its product definitions to better fit products specifically designed for the healthcare and education end markets the net effect of this is that the estimated market size for the north american contract industry will increase substantially  resulting in a reorientation of market share estimates across each industry participant however any bifma statistics that are mentioned throughout this document are based on the historical method of compiling the industry data and the company anticipates disclosure of bifma statistical data under the new method in the first quarter of fiscal  the company also monitors trade statistics reported by the us census bureau which reports monthly retail sales growth data across a number of retail categories including furniture and home furnishing stores this information provides a relative comparison to our consumer reportable segment looking forward the general economic outlook for our industry in the north america is expected to be positive bifma issued its most recent report in february  which forecasts that the growth rate of office furniture orders will be  percent and  percent in calendar  and  respectively while the growth rate of shipments will be  percent and  percent for calendar  and  respectively this forecast of growth is based primarily on employment gains in the us tempered by the current global economic uncertainty   discussion of business conditions the growth in sales and earnings during fiscal  brought with it increased cash generation as of the end of fiscal  total cash and cash equivalents of  million represented an increase of  million from fiscal  cash flows from operations in the period were  million which represented an increase of  percent from fiscal  the north american segment contributed significantly to our growth in net sales orders and earnings during fiscal  net sales for the segment grew at a rate of  percent and orders increased by  percent as compared to fiscal  organic net sales growth for the year was  percent  and orders increased  percent while operating earnings increased  percent to  million during fiscal  we believe this improvement demonstrates the impact of our investments over the past year in new products refreshed showrooms and a solutionsbased selling approach that provides our customers with problem solving designs in spite of the negative impact of foreign currency translation the ela segment posted growth in net sales  percent and operating earnings  percent as compared to the prior year while orders for the period decreased by  percent on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal  net sales growth for the year was  percent  and orders increased  percent during fiscal  a new manufacturing and distribution facility was opened in the united kingdom which has bolstered operational efficiency assembly operations were also launched in india significantly expanding our ability to service customers in this growing market finally the asiapacific region has benefited from renewed momentum of the posh brand which delivered sales growth and improved profitability throughout the year our specialty segment also showed growth as compared to the prior year sales increased  percent compared to fiscal  driven mainly by improved sales volumes related to geiger wood products and the herman miller collection operating earnings increased  million from fiscal  increased sales volumes decreases in material costs and improved operational efficiencies had a favorable impact on operating earnings for the specialty segment the consumer segment saw an increase in net sales of  million in the current fiscal year as compared to fiscal  an increase of  million was driven by the fact that  weeks of dwr results were included in our consolidated results for fiscal  as compared to  weeks in fiscal  sales were adversely impacted primarily by the following factors continued impact from closing smaller legacy dwr studio locations as we look to transition into larger format studios interruptions in selling activity resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system at dwr during the second quarter of fiscal  continued impact from the deliberate reduction in the number of independent retail distributors within our legacy consumer wholesale business while the current year results for the consumer segment did not meet our expectations we believe the value drivers within the consumer segment remain intact to drive future growth these drivers include the transition of dwr studios to larger more efficient formats and increasing the breadth of the product portfolio particularly in the area of exclusive product designs the economic backdrop of our businesses was mixed globally north america continued to benefit from strong employment and encouraging construction and architectural billings data commodity costs particularly that of steel remained relatively low throughout fiscal  though in recent months has been steadily increasing outside of north america we are closely monitoring commoditydriven economies that are currently or are expected to experience slower growth in the future in addition growing uncertainty over the impact of a united kingdom exit from the european union is an area of concern for our business in that important market  nongaap measurements see accompanying reconciliations and explanations   reconciliation of nongaap financial measures expenses associated with acquisitionrelated inventory adjustments transaction expenses associated with recent acquisitions noncash impairment expenses nonrecurring gains related to the sale of property and dealers and impact of nonrecurring tax items adjusted ebitda is calculated by excluding depreciation amortization and other net income or expense from adjusted operating earnings organic sales represents the change in net sales excluding currency translation effects and the impact of acquisitions we present the adjusted financial measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe them to be useful in analyzing ongoing results from operations the adjusted financial measures are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to gross margin operating expenses operating earnings loss and earnings loss per share  diluted under gaap the adjusted financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of the adjusted financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items we compensate for these limitations by providing prominence of our gaap results and using the adjusted financial measures only as a supplement the following table reconciles net sales to organic net sales for the years and
