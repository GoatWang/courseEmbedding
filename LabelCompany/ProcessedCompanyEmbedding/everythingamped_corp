bachelor party in las vegas visiting las vegas also known as sin city for a bachelor’s party or get together is fun in and of itself las vegas has an active nightlife with great bars and restaurants as well as dance clubs to visit when you add in the gambling shows and shopping options there is much to do in the city which can appeal to almost anyone these options make las vegas a tourist destination as well as a great spot to have a bachelor party for many a standard bachelor party is not what many people are looking for but rather an exceptional experience vegas is the perfect spot for outstanding bachelor parties partly due to the option for hiring las vegas escorts and strippers amping up a bachelor party let’s face it years from now none of your friends will be talking about that great steak you had during your bachelor party though you should have a great steak during your bachelor party instead the memories will be focused on the fun you had and the strippers and escorts you spent time with amping up a bachelor party or other special event involves choosing some highclass escorts or strippers to make the night unique further few men can really let loose in their home town with the potential watchful eye of their spouse and their friends going to a location far from home that is wellknown for debauchery and contains a wealth of options to partake but also has other options that may not lead your spouse to assume that you are necessarily doing something wrong is the perfect balance between the two and allows you to party without the anxiety and fear you may experience in a local setting choosing las vegas strippers strippers are a common mainstay at any bachelor party and a rite of passage for many of these parties few men would feel as if a bachelor party was complete without a stripper making an appearance however many parts of the country do not have the depth and quality of strippers available that a city like las vegas does with its reputation for sin and selecting a stripper in las vegas is a great way to make the night an exceptional one it would be foolish to believe that everyone has the same tastes and las vegas has a full menu available at all differing costs to whet any appetite combine the plethora of options with great and easily accessible hotels that the las vegas strippers feel comfortable visiting and a winning combination is there for a memorable night just be sure to choose a stripper that fits the tastes of the groom and not your own visiting las vegas escorts there are many reasons why people flock to las vegas to visit escorts nevada is the only state where it is legal to visit an escort this attracts a significant amount of people to las vegas to either work as an escort or to visit them thereby expanding the pool for escort services the result of this is that there is a wealth of different options for those who are looking to try las vegas escorts and these options can fit almost any taste or fetish that you may have for a bachelor party that has a wide range of different tastes this provides you with a full range of options to choose between to satisfy the desires of party attendees further bachelor party attendees can visit escorts without fear of legal repercussion and be comforted that many of the escorts at many ranches are regularly tested which reduces the chance of contracting a sexually transmitted disease further visiting a legal and established escort agency often provides overall higher quality women with a decreased chance of being ripped off and a better overall experience than you would in a location where escorts are not legal less risk and better options are clearly a boon to someone who is looking to visiting an escort particularly when travelling with a large bachelor party with attendees with different tastes it can be hard to appease a large group of people when visiting a restaurant and you can imagine how this translates to something like visiting an escort there is also added comfort in knowing that there will be enough escorts to satisfy everyone in your party looking to visit them during your las vegas bachelor party the same is true for an escort who can operate with greater freedom and may be more willing to have a wild time particularly in a bachelor party setting which can prove to be quite lucrative escorts and strippers are a quintessential part of bachelor parties around the world however las vegas escorts and strippers are particularly renowned for their reasonable cost availability and accessibility the wide range of options available and due to their legal status in the state this means that a las vegas bachelor party is the perfect place to amp up your bachelor party and create an experience that stands out

everythingamped corporation formerly brown grotto acquisition corporation notes to the unaudited financial statements september       note   nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies   nature of operations   everythingamped corporation formerly brown grotto acquisition corporation or “the company” was incorporated on january   under the laws of the state of delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking including but not limited to selected mergers and acquisitions   on september   the company effected a change in control by the redemption of  shares of the then outstanding  shares of common stock the then current officers and directors resigned and david boulette was named the sole officer and director of the company pursuant to the change in control the company changed its name to everythingamped corporation on september   the company issued  shares of common stock to mr boulette   the company intends to develop either through a business combination with an ongoing company or an online company offering owned and operated web sites and hundreds of mobile apps integrated exclusively to build a custom demand side platform this platform will provide unparalleled online advertising opportunities to companies of all sizes   the company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with everythingamped the combination is expected to take the form of a merger a stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange   in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company the company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of    basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheet as of september   unaudited condensed statements of operations for the three and nine months ended september   and cash flows for the nine months ended september   have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations in the opinion of management of the company all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included operating results for the three and nine month periods ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending december   or any other period these unaudited condensed financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for each of the year ended december   included in the company’s annual report on form k the accompanying audited condensed balance sheet as of december   has been derived from the audited financial statements filed in our form k and is included for comparison purposes in the accompanying balance sheet   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates                      everythingamped corporation formerly brown grotto acquisition corporation notes to the unaudited financial statements september       cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of september     concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september     income taxes   under asc  “income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of september   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration   loss per common share   basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments                      everythingamped corporation formerly brown grotto acquisition corporation notes to the unaudited financial statements september       note   going concern   the company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained an operating loss of  for the period ended september   the company had no working capital and an accumulated deficit of  as of september   the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources as may be required    the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above condition raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   in order to maintain its current level of operations the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity however the company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity if the company is unable to acquire additional working capital it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations   note   stockholders’ deficit   the company is authorized to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock as of september    shares of common stock and no preferred stock were issued and outstanding   on january   the company issued  founders common stock to two directors and officers on september   the company redeemed and cancelled  of the then outstanding  shares   on september   the company issued  shares to david boulette as part of the change in control of the company   during the period ending september   mr boulette as the company’s sole officer and director paid for company operating expenses as a capital contribution in the amount of  which has been recorded as additional paidin capital                      item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    forwardlooking
