vancouverite interested in business and law ubc was the natural choice for ron he completed the sevenyear combined commercelaw program in  and found the legal education he received at ubc to be indispensable preparation for his employment at farris  company however his foray into the legal world did not last long a year after being called to the bar in  ron decided to enroll in the mba program at the university of western ontario after completing one semester of the mba program it became apparent to ron that after seven and a half years of university it was time to get some practical business experience in january of  ron moved to toronto and joined campeau corporation which at the time was a major real estate development company ron worked for campeau corporation for nine years in  campeau corporation acquired allied stores corporation in the united states which resulted in ron’s relocation to new york subsequently federated department stores was acquired in april of  as a result of his business acumen and strong leadership skills ron became president and coo of campeau corporation in  at the age of  however in  both federated and allied were forced into chapter  which at the time was one of the largest nonfinancial bankruptcies in us history ron was faced with the defining moment of his young career william miller a former secretary of the treasury and campeau board member asked ron to assume responsibility for negotiating the plan of reorganization for federated and allied which at the time had over  billion of combined indebtedness the sheer complexity and magnitude of the reorganization coupled with the necessity to resign from campeau corporation with which he was closely aligned made the decision a difficult one ron agreed to do it and

recently being the  billion acquisition of may department stores company in august of  despite his numerous professional accomplishments ron maintains that family is his top priority he believes that personal success lies in accomplishing the goals that you set for yourself while remembering that they must be recalibrated throughout life according to ron the key to success can be summed up in one word balance his words of advice are to take advantage of the opportunities that you are given and to try to give back in what you do never letting your perspective become skewed ron is involved in numerous community organizations and serves on the board of directors of three major corporations including canadian imperial bank of commerce the balanced perspective with which ron approaches life is apparent when asked about his experience at ubc the two highlights he recalled were the impressive quality of the faculty at ubc and acting as a moot judge for the woman who would eventually become his wife ron tysoe is a role model and an exemplary alumnus whose welldeserved success is a testament to the profound effect of equilibrium and encouragement to us all to live “balanced” lives
