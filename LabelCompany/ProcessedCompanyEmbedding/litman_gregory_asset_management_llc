portfolios are strongly benefiting from their overweight to foreign markets specifically european and emergingmarket stocks second quarter  investment commentary in this quarter’s commentary we discuss the relative calmness of financial markets despite significant geopolitical uncertainty the strong performance of both risky assets stocks and defensive assets bonds and recent market trends favoring our foreign stock investments putting bonds to work in our client portfolios flexible bond funds and floatingrate loan funds continue to make up over half of our clients’ fixedincome exposure we anticipate their returns will far exceed those of core bonds and recent portfolio performance has borne this out hope and luck are not successful investment approaches when markets are turbulent particularly when stocks fall unexpectedly resisting the urge to start looking for reasons to bail out of the market can be a tall order if you have a sound investment process though these are the
