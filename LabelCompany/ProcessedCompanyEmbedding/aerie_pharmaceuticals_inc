pharmaceuticals reports positive roclatan™ netarsudillatanoprost ophthalmic solution  phase  month topline safety results roclatan™ successfully demonstrates a positive safety profile and efficacy levels consistent with previously reported results conference call and webcast today july  at  pm et july    pm eastern daylight time irvine califbusiness wireaerie pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqaeri a clinicalstage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of firstinclass therapies for the treatment of patients with glaucoma and other diseases of the eye today reported the successful month safety results of the company’s “mercury ” phase  registration trial for its fixeddose combination product candidate roclatan™ mercury  is a month safety and efficacy trial which included a day efficacy endpoint as previously reported both mercury  and mercury  the company’s second phase  registration trial of roclatan™ achieved their day primary efficacy endpoints of demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components at all measured time points including aerie product candidate rhopressa™ netarsudil ophthalmic solution  and marketleading prostaglandin analogue pga latanoprost all of which were dosed once daily in the evening the purpose of the month mercury  study is to provide adequate safety data for an expected nda new drug application submission to the fda in the first half of  while not primary endpoints the study also included measurements of intraocular pressure iop at  am  am and  pm at months six nine and twelve the month safety and efficacy results of mercury  were consistent with the day results from the mercury  and mercury  trials each of which evaluated patients with maximum baseline iops ranging from above  to below  mmhg millimeters of mercury management will host a conference call with accompanying slides to discuss these results at  pm eastern time et today the accompanying slides will be available at aerie’s website aeriepharmacom roclatan™ month safety and efficacy highlights for mercury  safety results for roclatan™ for the month period were consistent with those observed for the day efficacy period in the trial there were no new adverse events that developed following the initial day period and there were no drugrelated serious or systemic adverse events as expected the most common adverse event for roclatan™ was conjunctival hyperemia or eye redness which was observed in approximately  percent of patients of which approximately  percent was determined to be mild by biomicroscopy as observed in previous trials hyperemia was sporadic with only approximately  percent of patients with hyperemia across each physician visit during the month period the other roclatan™ adverse events observed during the month trial are consistent with those observed during the initial day efficacy period including conjunctival hemorrhages subconjunctival petechiae and cornea verticillata in addition to the primary efficacy endpoint at  days iops were measured at  am  am and  pm at months six nine and twelve roclatan™ iop lowering exceeded that of both latanoprost and rhopressa™ in a range from  to  mmhg levels of iop lowering were consistent with those observed in the mercury  and mercury  day efficacy results for all arms of the study roclatan™ also demonstrated consistent levels of iop lowering across the month study period roclatan™ reduced mean diurnal iops to  mmhg or lower in  percent of patients a significantly higher percentage than observed in the two comparator arms the rhopressa™ arm of the study performed consistently with previous phase  trials from both a safety and efficacy perspective rhopressa™ also demonstrated consistent levels of iop lowering across the month study period at baseline iops below  mmhg rhopressa™ iop lowering was similar to latanoprost at month  “with these positive month mercury  data we have again demonstrated the consistent and wellunderstood performance of roclatan™ and rhopressa™ from both a safety and efficacy perspective roclatan™ has the potential to become the most efficacious ioplowering therapy to enter the market if approved bolstered by an overall favorable safety and tolerability profile we continue to expect to submit our roclatan™ nda new drug application in the first half of ” said vicente anido jr phd chairman and chief executive officer at aerie dr anido continued “this data readout represents the last in our series of phase  trials for both roclatan™ and rhopressa™ for approval in the us and we are now actively engaged in preparations for the expected rhopressa™ commercialization next year” richard a lewis md aerie’s chief medical officer added “as a clinician i am very excited about the responder analysis data for roclatan™ showing such a profound drop in iop we now have a robust understanding of the roclatan™ safety profile and expect that clinicians will be highly satisfied with the month safety and efficacy data” about roclatan™ roclatan™ is a oncedaily eye drop that combines rhopressa™ as described below with latanoprost a widely prescribed pga based on the company’s preclinical studies and clinical trials to date aerie believes that roclatan™ if approved would be the first glaucoma product to lower iop through all known mechanisms i increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork the eye’s primary drain ii increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway the eye’s secondary drain iii reducing fluid production in the eye and iv reducing episcleral venous pressure evp by covering the full spectrum of known ioplowering mechanisms roclatan™ has the potential to provide a greater ioplowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product the first phase  registration trial for roclatan™ named mercury  is a month safety and efficacy trial which was just completed and is the subject of this press release mercury  had a successful day efficacy readout in september  the second phase  registration trial named mercury  is a day efficacy trial which reported successful primary efficacy results in may  the topline day efficacy readouts for both mercury  and mercury  demonstrated that roclatan™ was statistically superior to each of its components thus achieving their primary clinical endpoints aerie expects to submit a roclatan™ nda to the us food and drug administration fda in the first half of  a third phase  registration trial named mercury  is expected to commence in europe in the third quarter of  mercury  is not necessary for approval in the us but rather to facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in europe about rhopressa™ rhopressa™ netarsudil ophthalmic solution  is a novel eye drop that the company believes if approved would become the only oncedaily product available that based on aerie’s preclinical and clinical studies to date specifically targets the trabecular meshwork the eye’s primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated iop in glaucoma preclinical and clinical studies have also demonstrated that rhopressa™ lowers episcleral venous pressure which contributes approximately half of iop in healthy subjects further based on aerie’s preclinical studies rhopressa™ may provide an additional mechanism that reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers iop biochemically the active ingredient in rhopressa™ netarsudil has been shown in aerie studies to inhibit both rho kinase rock and norepinephrine transporter net recent preclinical studies have also shown that rhopressa™ may have diseasemodifying properties including an antifibrotic effect of netarsudil on trabecular meshwork cells and the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork the results of two phase  registration trials rocket  and rocket  for rhopressa™ were included in the nda submission to the fda in february  there were two additional phase  registration trials for rhopressa™ named rocket  and rocket  rocket  was a small month safetyonly study in canada that was not necessary for the nda submission and for which enrollment has been discontinued rocket  which was successfully completed in april  was designed to provide adequate sixmonth safety data for regulatory filing purposes in europe and was also not necessary for the nda

netarsudillatanoprost ophthalmic solution  phase  topline efficacy results roclatantm successfully achieves primary efficacy endpoint in mercury  study conference call and webcast today september  at  pm et irvine califbusiness wire aerie pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqaeri a clinicalstage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of firstinclass therapies for the treatment of glaucoma and other diseases of the eye today reported the successful day primary efficacy results of its month phase  mercury  clinical trial for its fixeddose combination product candidate roclatantm the study achieved its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components including aerie product candidate rhopressatm netarsudil ophthalmic solution  and market leading prostaglandin analogue pga latanoprost all of which were dosed once daily in the evening the study evaluated patients with maximum baseline intraocular pressures iops ranging from above  to below  mmhg millimeters of mercury the ioplowering effect of roclatantm was  to  mmhg greater than monotherapy with either latanoprost or rhopressatm throughout the duration of the study management will host a conference call with accompanying slides to discuss these results at  pm et today the accompanying slides are available at aeries web site aeriepharmacom roclatantm phase  highlights for mercury  roclatantm dosed once daily achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over both latanoprost and rhopressatm at the primary endpoint range of baseline iops from above  to below  mmhg for each of the nine measured time points iops were measured at  am  am and  pm at week  week  and day  roclatantm iop lowering exceeded that of latanoprost in a range of  to  mmhg and exceeded rhopressatm iop lowering in a range of  to  mmhg efficacy levels were consistent across the day period for all arms in the study roclatantm mean diurnal ioplowering exceeded that of latanoprost by an average across the study duration of  mmhg and exceeded rhopressatm by  mmhg roclatantm reduced mean diurnal iops to  mmhg or lower in  percent of patients a significantly higher percentage than observed in the comparator arms the most common roclatantm adverse event was hyperemia or eye redness which was reported in approximately  percent of patients or  percent above baseline and was scored as mild for the large majority of these patients there were no drugrelated serious adverse events for any of the comparators in the trial aerie will hold an investor day in new york city on october   to cover further details from the mercury  trial and to provide a general business update we are very pleased by these roclatantm day efficacy results from the mercury  clinical trial as expected the topline efficacy demonstrated in this trial clearly reconfirms the potential for roclatantm to become the most efficacious ioplowering therapy to enter the market if approved if mercury  and  are successful we expect to file the nda for roclatantm near yearend  said vicente anido jr phd chairman and chief executive officer at aerie dr anido continued we also noted that the rhopressatm arm demonstrated high levels of efficacy across the full range of baseline iops studied and the efficacy was maintained for the day period importantly rhopressatm demonstrated comparable levels of iop lowering to latanoprost at baseline iops ranging from  to  mmhg in mercury  this performance for rhopressatm is consistent with levels observed in the previous phase b trials for rhopressatm and roclatantm richard a lewis md aeries chief medical officer added oncedaily roclatantm has shown a degree of iop lowering in mercury  that is quite impressive especially when considering its ability to bring patient pressures down to levels as low as  to  mmhg the safety profile of roclatantm observed thus far in mercury  points to a safe and tolerable product about roclatantm roclatantm is a oncedaily eye drop that combines rhopressatm as described below with latanoprost a pga that is the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug in the world based on our preclinical studies and clinical trials we believe that roclatantm if approved would be the first glaucoma product to lower iop through all known mechanisms i increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork the eyes primary drain ii increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway the eyes secondary drain iii reducing fluid production in the eye and iv reducing episcleral venous pressure evp by covering the full spectrum of known ioplowering mechanisms roclatantm has the potential to provide a greater ioplowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product the first phase  registration trial for roclatantm named mercury  is a month safety trial in  patients with a day efficacy readout which is the subject of this press release the topline efficacy readout demonstrated that roclatantm was statistically superior to each of its components the second phase  registration trial named mercury  is a day efficacy trial that commenced in march  and a third phase  registration trial named mercury  is expected to commence in europe in the first half of  mercury  is not necessary for approval in the us but rather to facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in europe about rhopressatm rhopressatm netarsudil ophthalmic solution  is a novel eye drop that we believe if approved would become the only oncedaily product available that based on aeries preclinical studies specifically targets the trabecular meshwork the eyes primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated iop in glaucoma preclinical studies have also demonstrated that rhopressatm lowers episcleral venous pressure which contributes approximately half of iop in healthy subjects further based on aeries preclinical studies rhopressatm provides an additional mechanism that reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers iop biochemically rhopressatm has been shown in aerie studies to inhibit both rho kinase rock and norepinephrine transporter net recent preclinical studies have also shown that rhopressatm may have diseasemodifying properties including an antifibrotic effect on the trabecular meshwork and the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork preclinical research is also currently underway to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of rhopressatm
