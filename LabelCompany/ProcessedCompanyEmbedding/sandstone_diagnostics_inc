director at sandstone diagnostics the makers of trak sara and her team have become one of the goto sources for information on trying to conceive with male factor infertility with their website don’t cook your balls they are working to launch an innovative men’s reproductive health kit that allows couples to monitor and improve sperm quality from the comfort and privacy of home trak naturally we love their mission to changing the way people approach their health read the full interview below and be sure to check out their websitewhat is sandstone diagnostics inc what is your mission what led to your cofounding of sandstone diagnosticssandstone’s mission is to empower consumers to measure monitor and improve their health with simple tools that provide actionable datadriven feedback our initial product trak is a men’s reproductive health kit that allows couples to monitor and improve sperm quality from the comfort and privacy of home sandstone diagnostics was founded when my husband and his colleague invented a powerful portable blood test while working at sandia national lab i was energized by the possibility of bringing high precision medical tests into the home giving people incredible feedback and insight into their health we launched sandstone in the spring of  with the dream of changing the way people approach their healthwhat are your responsibilities at sandstone diagnosticsmy primary role at sandstone is to be the advocate for the consumer i support usability aspects of product development do much of the medical  health related research to develop our educational materials and personalized feedback systems and i spend a lot of time on social media talking listening to people who have health concerns to make sure that we can really bring authentic solutions to empower them to move their health forwardcopyright  sandstone diagnostics incwhat is trak how revolutionary is trak for couples trying to conceive trak is the definitive datadriven tool to measure monitor and improve men’s reproductive health from the comfort and privacy of home trak consists of a simple instrument disposable test kits mobile app and education that empowers men to take control of their reproductive health and improve a couple’s chances of conceptionhow does trak analyze and monitor semen count trak works like a minicentrifuge a semen sample is loaded into a disposable prop and spun on the engine for about  minutes any sperm cells present are forced into the prop channel where they form a visible white column the height of the column correlates with the concentration of sperm cells in the sample results are read like an oldschool thermometerare there certain guidelines restrictions to follow such as refraining from ejaculating before use during any semen test and probably using the stork otc should follow a few simple guidelines to produce a healthy sample  you should abstain from ejaculation for  days this will give you the highest number of healthy sperm cells in the sample  avoid using lubricants or condoms in the collection of a sample as they will kill sperm cells interesting fact in general the more excited a man is when collecting a sample the more sperm cells he will produce i think this is one of the incredible parts about the stork the body somehow knows when it is “the real deal” and studies have shown that men produce better sperm when they are passionate and excited good sex is something everyone can get behindhow has male factor fertility changed over the past decade what do you attribute to the rise in diagnoses of male factor issues globally sperm counts have been declining for several decades no one knows exactly why leading suspects are increases in obesity decreased movement increase in stress and increased exposure to pollution  toxins personally i think guys are cooking their balls there are a lot of ways to overheat testicles – fat biking laptops cell phones long periods of sitting getting sick men trying to conceive should be mindful of how hot it gets down therehow can women encouragesupport their partner when diagnosed with male factory fertility i’ve talked to a lot of men who have been diagnosed with infertility and there are a number of things that i hear all the time  men feel guilty they are upset with their body for letting them down but even more they are sad they may not be able to give a baby to the woman they love the biggest thing women can do is remind him that she loves him that they are a team and can do this together  men tend to communicate differently than women they need separate time and space to get thoughts together if conversation is hard try something less direct like email texting or a shared journal  give him some space he needs to process this men like to hide in caves when they are hurt and come out strong again try to respect his needs  make him open up just like he needs space he also needs to come back to you find opportunities to restore intimacy think about taking a break from “trying” just to have sex for fun find meaning in the “right now” and in each other as a couple uncertainty and infertility are hard on both of you he might brush it off but he really really does care taking time to let go of the future and embracing the now can give you both the mental and emotional break you need to refuelone last tip that i heard from one guy “women’s thoughts are a ball of string everything is connected to everything you can talk about problems and love and work and the house all at the same time men struggle to keep up we keep all our thoughts in boxes the problem box the sex box the work box we actually have to pack up all our thoughts and put the box away before getting out a new box if you switch the conversation too quickly we can get an hourglass over our heads while we are frantically trying to put one box away and get a new one out – also we actually do have a box called “nothing” it is our favorite box sometimes we take it out and just think about nothing at all and it is the best”what are some natural ways to optimize male fertility factors like count motility etc food exercise there are lots of things men can do to improve fertility  avoid heat – hottubs seat warmers long periods of sitting long showers biking dog or laptop on the lap etc  maintain a healthy body weight if you have a gut lose  pounds or   eat well vitamins  antioxidants are hugely helpful for sperm a good rule of thumb is to think about sperm cells like a embryo things that are good for pregnant women to eat are good for men trying to conceive  exercise what’s good for the heart is good for sperm and healthy erections get off your butt you’ll feel better and make more sperm  no smoking or drinking cigarettes are one of the worst things for sperm so is mary jane btw alcohol really messes with testosterone  estrogen balance and in high amounts is toxic to sperm cells don’t want your swimmers under the influence  have good sex often if you are using em you’ll make more of em  check your meds some medications cause sperm problems  get good sleep every night  maintain healthy stress level stress hormones can mess with testosterone and sperm production find ways to live in the present and appreciate the small things in life  be competitive playing sports or having hobbies that unleashes healthy competitive emotions can boost testosterone levelsif you want to go the extra mile  ice your balls regular cooling has been incredibly effective at improving sperm count  acupuncture increases blood flow and improves male fertility  herbs several herbs have been shown to improve male fertility check out conceivable  take a multivitamin  prenatal  fertility supplement concentrated antioxidants  visit a urologist specialized in male fertility – there are medications surgeries and other treatment options available for menwhat is the expected launch date for trak trak is currently in clinical trials
