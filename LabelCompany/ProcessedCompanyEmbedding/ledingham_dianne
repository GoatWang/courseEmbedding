english english spanish add copyright permissions quantity discounts number of copyright permissions language english spanish quantity buying for your team add to cart description publication date september   for years sales managers at many companies have relied on top performers and sheer numbers of sales reps to stay competitive but while they may have squeaked by on this wingandaprayer technique their sales teams havent thrived the way they once did todays most successful sales leaders are taking a more scientific approach savvy managers are reshaping their tactics in response to changing markets they are reaching out to new customers in innovative ways and they are increasing productivity by helping the reps they already have make the most of their skills and resources leaders who take a scientific approach to sales force effectiveness have learned to use four levers to boost their reps productivity in a predictable and manageable way first they systematically target their firms offerings matching the right products with the right customers second they optimize the automation tools and procedures at their disposal providing reps with the support they need to boost sales third they analyze and manage their reps performance measuring both internal processes and results to determine their teams strengths and weaknesses fourth they pay close attention to sales force deploymenthow well sales support marketing and delivery resources are matched to customers these four levers can help sales leaders increase productivity across the board the authors say though they have the greatest impact on lower ranked performers the overall effect of increasing the average sales per employee can be exponential it means a company wont have to rely on just a few talented individuals to stay competitive this is especially important because finding and keeping star salespeople is more difficult than ever whats more managers who optimize the sales forces they already have can see returns they never thought possible product  rhpdfeng pages  related topics forecasting marketing productivity sales strategic planning technology how to download to download this
