founder and cto of wordstream which provides the minute ppc work week and the free adwords grader you can subscribe here to kims business growth tips by email larrykim founder and cto wordstreamlarrykim write a comment credit getty images hes a successful entrepreneur whose bostonbased company has raised over  million in venture capital and was the subject of tech writer dan lyons book disrupted but what helped shape dharmesh shah into an inbound marketing powerhouse check out these incredible facts about the cofounder and cto of hubspot   a pioneer of inbound marketing dharmesh shah met his hubspot cofounder brian halligan when they were grad students at mit  the two set out to create an online marketing platform driven by the flagging success of direct mail and other old school marketing tactics   shah graduated mit with an ms in the management of technology which he once described as  this weird kind of engineering mixed with like an mba kind of thing essentially an mba with some technical geeky stuff thrown in   his first startup pyramid digital solutions launched in  when shah was  years old after bootstrapping it with less than  he sold it for millions to sungard data systems the company hed worked for when he originally came up with the idea in  hubspot is shahs third company   because he didnt like selling shah had a genius idea and convinced sungard data systems to actually sell that first software he left their company to startup without even realizing what it was at the time he struck a distribution partnership with a major player in software sales   shah founded that first company with a cofounder his brother who was only  and just out of high school when pyramid digital systems launched   he landed his brother a job at sungard alongside him by convincing a manager that hiring a hr consultant was a waste when the job was something his teenaged brother then a grocery store clerk could do just as well   before cofounding hubspot in july  shah had promised his wife he wouldnt start another company and would be an angel investor instead he started investing in other companies while at mit on his decision to start another company after promising not to hes said i could not help myself its just a genetic flaw   shah counts innovator of the year mass tlc  inc  award     boston globe  hitech innovator  and social media allstar mitx  among his awards   from year one hubspot has had an internal wiki that gives employees access to all kinds of company information including cash balance board decks bank balance sales figures burn rate and more shah believes people do well within his company because of this transparency and other aspects of hubspots culture   he founded and writes for onstartupscom which has more than  members in its online community   shah has identified blogging and social media as the two accelerants that helped hubspot grow as quickly as it did   he still tries to write code every day and says it keeps me in touch with reality and makes me a better entrepreneur  plus i enjoy it   before the hubspot market product was even written or launched shah and halligan started the hubspot blog they used it to position their software as an inbound marketing solution before it existed in the marketplace   according to shah insecurity is one of the worst fates to befall an entrepreneur if you could manage to take insecurity out of a team amazing things happen if you could take insecurity out of yourself amazing things start to happen hes said   dharmesh shah is the coauthor of both inbound marketing get found using google social media and blogs and inbound marketing attract engage and delight customers online   shah said he faced his darkest entrepreneurial days in his first business with the hiring of their first employees and facing down cash flow issues by  he said the thing that i worry about is that sometimes its a matter of how you define success for us its like living up to the potential of the team thats here thats what really keeps me up   shah wrote his thesis on you guessed it software startups   now an angel investor shah has said he tends to be slightly biased towards entrepreneurs who have a point to prove or even have a small chip on their shoulder   shah has publicly stated that he hates enterprise software despite or maybe because of the fact that his first company was an enterprise software brand he explains why its particularly bad now back in the s it wasnt so bad its  revenue concentration so you have a few number of customers that are writing you really big checks which then impacts your product road map because ok if theyre writing big enough checks you do what they ask you to do we can not do that people dont realize this but the feedback loop and the shortness of it has such a high impact on your overall success and happiness   in his first several dozen angel investing deals which coincided with his founding and early growth of hubspot shah was so pressed for time that he never met or even spoke on the phone with half the entrepreneurs he funded   shah met a number of entrepreneurs online through his onstartups blog and when inspired would decide to fund their projects he was an early investor in backupify shareaholic and buffer among others   he counts php codeigniter mysql python and django  among his skills   one of the first things he does as an introverted angel is shah google searches an entrepreneur whos caught his attention hes said im going to find everything youve ever said written or shared essentially i think the mark of a great entrepreneur today is that someone is in the game its not just a matter of oh i woke up this morning and said this was a great idea im going to go build a startup you need to put yourself out there a little bit and give me evidence that you actually care dharmesh shah showcased his ability to roll with the punches in his companys response to the controversy created by the release of disrupted theres much to be learned from the successes of entrepreneurs like shah but even more from the way they handle themselves when the chips are down
