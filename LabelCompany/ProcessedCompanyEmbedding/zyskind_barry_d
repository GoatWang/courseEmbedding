incorporated job details amcomp® has established an education program to raise professional standards in the field of workers compensation each of us is able to detail the need to improve the industry in our own business histories almost always concluding that a common body of knowledge and measurement would benefit all participants in the field insurers reinsurers insureds selfinsureds regulators agents brokers and most importantly claimants the formation of amcomp® and the commitment by its board and membership to do something about this universally perceived need set the amcomp® education committee on a course that has spanned several years and produced quality results in the summer of  amcomp® began to develop a comprehensive education program involving individuals associated with wellestablished educational institutions who could help amcomp® achieve the educational goals the association set forth after a period of refining and finetuning the program the association achieved its goal of completing a comprehensive threepart certification program the amcomp® certification program leading to the certified workers compensation professional wcp designation consists of three parts each consisting of ten chapters the program utilized multiple reading sources and was designed in a fashion similar to a regular college course building on material covered in the preceding chapters efforts were continued to identify ways to improve the program most recently the various reading sources were consolidated into a single text and the board of directors did away with the three part program this text entitled workers compensation the first one hundred years provides a comprehensive base of information regarding the various aspects of workers compensation with the completion of the amcomp® text book and course guide the format of the course was changed to include only these materials through this text those who have taken the course of study will have a better understanding and appreciation for how the multiple pieces of the workers compensation program eg claims risk management pricing etc work together to make the greater whole the following serves to highlight the material covered in each of the twelve chapterschapter one  the early development of workmens compensation later to become workers compensation in europe is traced along with its subsequent development in the united states with the passage of time certain shortcomings of the program were recognized and in  a national commission was created to study the program and make recommendations for improvement in response to these recommendations states enacted substantial reforms in subsequent years the chapter concludes with an examination of the subject of coverage including those employers who must be covered along with a review of those employees who are covered chapter twothe almost universal test for compensability of a workplace injury or death is that it must arise out of and in the course of the employment while the two phrases arising out of and in the course of the employment appear fairly straightforward in actual terminology these phrases have been the subject of extensive litigation and expansion since their first enactment a review of statutory provisions along with case law serves to depict how the subject has evolved over time and how it is being addressed legislatively in a number of jurisdictions chapter three many states modeled their original compensation laws after the english workmens compensation act of  which included reference to personal injury by accident this language was designed to ensure that employers were only responsible for unintended injuries stemming from a workplace incident with the passage of time this limited definition evolved and today the workers compensation program includes not only an expanded scope of covered injuries but also a broad array of occupational diseases these conditions continue to be the subject of controversy and litigation today chapter four  the fundamental concept behindworkers compensation is that the employer is responsible for certain benefits to an employee injured on the job without consideration for the issue of fault these mandated benefits include the furnishing of medical care necessary for recovery and the payment of a portion of lost income in the instance of injury or death resulting from a workrelated cause this chapter examines the various types of benefits afforded through the workers compensation program along with the different forms of income replacement benefits that may be available to a worker who receives a workrelated injury certain prescribed benefits are also payable to surviving dependents in the event of a workrelated death chapter five  benefit security and the various forms of that security is examined in chapter five benefit security takes the form of insurance or individual or group selfinsurance within the insurance mechanism one finds private insurance competitive or monopolistic state funds and the residual market or assigned risk pools while benefit security is a critical component of the program responsible employers focus on workplace safety as the primary approach for purposes of reducing workplace injuries the chapter concludes with a look at various employer loss control techniques along with the role played at the federal and state level by the occupational safety and health administration osha chapter six following an examination of the forms of benefit security available to employers in the preceding chapter this chapter shifts to an examination of the standard workers compensation and employers liability policy each section of the policy is reviewed with a copy of the policy available for purposes of perusal the chapter includes a review of some of the more frequently used policy endorsements along with an explanation of the particular situations in which the endorsements should be included with the policy the chapter concludes with an examination of some of the various federal compensation programs involving the payment of benefits chapter seven the method for determining workers compensation rates  the manual rating system  and an examination of the subjects of experience rating and retrospective rating are covered in this chapter the method of classification of risks is studied in some detail inasmuch as the classification system is the cornerstone of the rating process both experience rating and retrospective rating are programs available to employers of a certain size and are designed to make the cost for insurance more reflective of the employers actual experience chapter eight thischapter reviews the claims administration process performed at the
