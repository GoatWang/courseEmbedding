benefits of home hemodialysis may not be experienced by all patients the nxstage system one is a prescription device and like all medical devices involves some risks the risks associated with hemodialysis treatments in any environment include but are not limited to high blood pressure fluid overload low blood pressure heartrelated issues and vascular access complications the medical devices used in hemodialysis therapies may add additional risks including air entering the bloodstream and blood loss due to clotting or accidental disconnection of the blood tubing set patients should consult with their doctor to understand the risks and responsibilities of home andor more frequent hemodialysis using the nxstage system one certain risks are unique to the home treatments at home are done without the presence of medical personnel and onsite technical support patients and their partners must be trained on what to do and how to get medical or technical help if needed certain risks associated with hemodialysis treatment are increased when performing nocturnal therapy due to the length of treatment time and because therapy is performed while the patient and care partner are sleeping these risks include but are not limited to blood access disconnects and blood loss during sleep blood clotting due to slower blood flow or increased treatment time or both and delayed response to alarms when waking from sleep patients should consult with their physician to understand the risks and responsibilities associated with home nocturnal hemodialysis using the
