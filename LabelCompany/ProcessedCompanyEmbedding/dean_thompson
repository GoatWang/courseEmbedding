someone who needs support how caringbridge can help dean thompson first post  latest post  dad had been more tired the beginning of this week and sleeping more than usual he was trying to rest up and get ready for his granddaughters wedding which is today  tuesday morning he woke up as usual but went back to bed shortly after around  am he was sitting by my mom at the table and she asked him to sign a wedding card and all he would say was yup whenever she asked him anything all he would say was yup  mom called the ambulance and they loaded him up and took him into monte while there his symptoms were consistent with a stroke so they began treating him for that all of his blood work was off the charts in many areas so they decided to take him by helicopter to north memorial medical center inminneapolis  that didnt go as planned as when they got dad in the helicopter he became agitated  so they brought him back into the er to sedate and incubate him when they got him back to the helicopter they noticed the monitors were not working so they had to wait for another helicopter from the cities they finally got him to msp about pm where hope mike joy mom bill  paulette haff and i met him in the stabilization room  initial tests showed dad was in acute kidney failure pneumonia and possible stroke  stroke could not be confirmed because of the heavy sedation  the doctors main area of concern was his  kidney function so they started him on kidney dialysis that night  that seemed to work very well for his left kidney but his right is much more damaged so that one is still struggling  wednesday an mri and ct was done and our prayers for no stroke were answered we were so thankful but last night we were dealt the heavy blow that in the ct scan they saw many spots on dads spine ribs femurs shoulder and jaw they said without talking with oncology its more than likely cancer that has metastasized to the bones from prostate cancer which would explain why the kidneys were blocked from the enlarged prostrate which brought him to kidney failure  we  havent been able to talk to him at all as they have kept him sedated  they are thinking of removing the incubation tube but we wont know anything without talking to oncology we cant get answers fast enough but we are praying for a miracle read more visit deans site caringbridge is a nonprofit social network dedicated to

masking on december   average rating  average rating   comments copy or sync only select photo edits and settings it would be great if we had the ability to copy and paste only some of the settings rather than all of the settings from one photo to many  for example one photo might have white balance contrast dehaze and sharpening applied but i may only want to apply white balance and sharpening on the this idea was tagged workflow on december   average rating  average rating   comments renaming local adjustments i often apply quite a few different local adjustments in several image areas that means i now get a list of local adjustemts in the right panel that i cannot easily connect with the area i used it on because they all have the same name it would be fantastic to change the name to this idea was tagged ui updates on december   average rating  average rating   comment save preferred brush settings for my workflow and taste i found a custom setting for the perfect brush and i’d like to save it as my standard brush instead to have to change it every image it would save me a lot of time and tedious work this idea was tagged tools workflow on november   average rating  average

on photo raw users should be encouraged to submit their lens profiles the user base should be able to feed back on their quality those with great feedback should be adopted as the ‘official’ profile

most of the photo editors i’ve found that there is a long list of sliders or tools that can be used and there’s too much to scroll and search what would be helpful is to have a favorite section where

multipleexposures and filter  bit when a bracketing is made a lovely adobe ps feature is  to produce a single  bit image i think that anyone that had worked with such an image would know its merits by swift masking with a brush one can achieve a custom desirable final hdr image from such a lovely source as this idea was tagged file support on october   average rating  average rating   comment ability to paste object removal to multiple photos with similar composition often times series of photos need the same object removed if the content aware delete function is properly performed on one photo there should be the ability to detect the removed object and look for the same object in a series of photos in a proximate area and automatically delete the object as long as this idea was tagged tools workflow on october   average rating  average rating  leave a comment ai enabled auto tone learns your style preferences photographers often have a preference for overall tone  highlight and shadow treatment etc adobe lightroom auto tone is very predictable in that in almost always raises the exposure of the photo and tends toward a high key look it has its own ‘style baked in’ the algorithm a proper auto tone function should learn this idea was tagged color  tone workflow on october   average rating  average rating  leave a comment texture modification i love using textures on portraits however in on effects you cannot remove the texture effect on skin and still leave the color imparted by the texture this is done in photoshop by making a selection of the area and then
