lehigh university bachelors degree carnegie mellon university mba family married sherry maiden name unknown children three career us steel management trainee mercer management consulting consultant and head of strategic practice us foodservice corporation chief financial officer fpl group  chief financial officer – president fpl energy – president and chief executive officer – president chief executive officer and chairman address fpl group  universe boulevard juno beach florida  httpwwwfplgroupcom ■ after just six months as the chief financial officer cfo of fpl in an industry in which he had no prior experience lewis hay iii was chosen president of fpl groups subsidiary fpl energy eighteen months later he was appointed president and chief executive officer ceo of the entire fpl group floridas largest publicutility holding company hays year career as a management consultant with mercer management consultants as well as his position as cfo of us foodservice which he led through  successful acquisitions placed him in good stead to take over the reins of fpl rather than being thought of as a consultant or foodservice industry executive he said maybe a better way of characterizing me is as a strategist and possibly a change agent florida trend june  blueprint for success although hay studied electrical engineering at lehigh university and was at the top of his class he did not relish the thought of looking at blueprints all day and decided to take a managementtrainee position with us steel later he took a position with a consulting firm that became known as mercer management consultants heading up strategic planning for the firm sara lee was one company for which hay consulted and its president john mckinnon recalled him as being just terribly bright and willing to work a monstrous amount of time to get things done florida trend june  hay in turn credited his experiences with the likes of mckinnon and other fortune  company executives for the breadth and depth of knowledge he took into his future career hay left mercer and became cfo of us foodservice into which he invested a considerable amount of his own money the  billion company was spun off from sara lee in  in a leveraged buyout and hays management abilities significantly enhanced its performance he built it into a billion company headquartered in columbia maryland that supplied food services to restaurants and cafeterias through more than  acquisitions and by promoting internal growth hay headed up the process of taking the company public in  he gained a reputation for his intelligence and abilities to successfully strategize and build revenue and in  he was recruited to fpl whose ceo james broadhead was also an engineer and energy outsider just six months after becoming cfo with the holding company hay became president of fpls fastgrowing independentpower business fpl energy the unregulated highgrowth subsidiary operated power plants across the united states and was the nations leader in windenergy generation it also constructed power plants in lessregulated states including wind solar natural gas and hydroelectric plants impresses the chief broadhead was impressed with how quickly hay improved the subsidiarys structure and the way in which his enthusiasism captured the spirit of those who worked for him under hays direction epl energy outperformed its  to  percent annual growth target for megawatt output at the same time hay was functioning as interim cfo while the company searched to fill the vacant post in  broadhead suddenly announced his retirement following his failed and extremely costly  billion merger attempt with entergy corporation and the furor surrounding  million in bonuses he shared with six other top executives in a package that was preapproved by shareholders broadhead recommended hay as his successor and the member board unanimously approved the recommendation thus less than two years into his career with the company hay was elected president and ceo of fpl he became chairman as well the following year broadhead spoke highly of hay lew has a drive to do better he said he just wants to improve everything he has the willingness to make difficult decisions if it requires changing the company if it means doing things differently … i just dont have the slightest doubt he will do it florida trend june  hay was praised for the discipline he employed during his first year with the company which analysts said was evident in that the company suffered no scandals like those faced by enron and other utilities in the same era even in light of the shattered confidence of analysts and investors alike that caused credit ratings and share prices of many other utility companies to plummet fpls ratings remained relatively stable growth strategy in an article for south florida business journal john t fakler noted that hay intended to improve the companys profits through the installation of generating capacity and improved operations its very important in my mind that we continue to show earnings growth at fpl energy in particular hay commented june   perhaps that is because he was already anticipating a possible deregulation of floridas utility companies following an interim report by the governors commission calling for such deregulation in some states deregulation had caused local utilities to sell off power plants to buyers from around the nation but hay indicated that he would like to see fpls deregulated utility fpl energy take over florida power  lights plants in the state fakler noted that walter l revell former secretary of the florida department of transportation and chair of the energy  study commission said he was looking forward to working with hay ive been advised that hes a very strong executive and know of several fpl board members who have expressed confidence in him said revell at the time hay was not seeking to make acquisitions although he indicated he would consider adding nuclear power to florida power  lights capacity if a good deal came along we will not rule out nuclear though no new plants are being built in this country he commented but there are a number of utilities that might make sense for our company—if we would get an acceptable return on investment south florida business journal june   in  hay utilized his acquisition skills with the purchase of a controlling interest in seabrook station nuclearpower plant in new hampshire a plant that was beset with antinuclear protests the deal led to a  percent increase in fpls total wattage generation while hay was cautious to avoid another costly and failed merger attempt he was optimistic about the possibility of wellplanned deals for the future his company had a substantial balance sheet and with the prevalence of overcapacity in the utility marketplace he anticipated many companies would be selling their assets at a discount he felt fpl was well positioned to capitalize on the consolidation that the industry was beginning to experience while waiting wrote vogel he took a cleaver to new projects postponing some and cancelling others cutting fpls commitment to buy gas turbines to seven from thirtytwo the company is no longer pursuing projects near sacramento calif everett wash and bellingham mass florida trends june  fakler noted that although florida was not an optimum state for producing wind energy hay contended that wind energy would become an important power generator for them it always seems like theres a nice breeze in florida commented hay we have sophisticated studies as to what makes a good prospect for wind generation although fpl group owned the two biggest solar facilities in the world both of which were bought out of bankruptcies for pennies on the dollar hay had no immediate intention to invest time and effort into them it does give us a lot of expertise about solar and enough knowledge to tell us that we cannot get a
