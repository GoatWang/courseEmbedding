email protected  july   share share on facebook tweet on twitter share on linkedin mighty squirrel founders henry manice left and naveen pawar right beer and sports go handinhand right that’s the idea behind henry manice and naveen pawar’s newly released mighty squirrel beer the brew which hit shelves in boston on june  and sold out within  hours is the first beer ever to contain up to  grams of protein “we wanted a brew that would fit in better at the finish line” “we loved playing tennis with friends and enjoying celebratory beers afterwards but we wanted a brew that would fit in better at the finish line” cofounder manice told bostinno inspired by this the two founders who met working as product managers at a spinal implant company set out to invent a flavorful firstofitskind craft beer with more protein “it was definitely a risk but it was thrilling to just go for it” manice says of leaving his stable job to pursue mighty squirrel beer fulltime “we knew we wanted to give it a shot and it has definitely been the roller coaster of our lives since naveen and i starting working on this full time in august ” as for the beer’s unique name the cofounder tells us that “mighty squirrel” originated from the founders’ code word for protein “we never thought ‘squirrel’ was actually going to be part of our brand name” manice said “but after years of saying squirrel this and squirrel that we decided well why not use squirrel in our company name since it means something to us plus we thought it could be a fun name for a beer” mighty squirrel the beer itself comes in two different varieties mighty squirrel original a vienna lager that is complex with bready caramel and citrus notes plus a hint of honey and five grams of protein and mighty squirrel light a light lager that is clean and crisp with citrus honey notes and five grams of protein for comparison a sam adams lager contains two grams of protein while a budweiser beer contains only one gram both beers manice said are brewed with the highest quality malt and hops from germany “we do not use adjuncts such as rice corn enzymes or sugars” he added “most all food and beverage companies have come out with products that have more protein due to consumer demand” manice said “we hope people enjoy our craft beer with more protein and we hope people have many ‘mighty moments’ to celebrate such as finishing a k a marathon etc as that is what we are all about” to create these “mighty moments” mighty squirrel will not only be getting involved with athletic groups in the area but will also be creating its own events “our ‘squirrel runs’ will consist of thirty or forty people running a few miles through boston and ending up at a cool bar for a beer or a water whichever you prefer” manice said currently the two founders are based out of wework while their mighty squirrel beer is being brewed at the von trapp brewery in stowe vermont “it is very expensive to build your own brewery so having a brewing partner made a lot of sense for us at this stage” manice said “someday we hope to be in a position to have our own mighty squirrel brewery” in the future expect to see mighty squirrel in numerous fridges throughout the boston area – as manice said that the beer company plans to scale up in and around boston beginning midjuly if you’re looking to try mighty squirrel you can find it at quality
