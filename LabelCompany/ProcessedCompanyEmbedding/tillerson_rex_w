individuals whose assets were blocked the treasury department said credit doug millsthe new york times washington — the treasury department on thursday fined exxon mobil  million for violating sanctions that the united states imposed on russia in  while rex w tillerson now the secretary of state was the oil company’s chief executivethe penalty was relatively small for the treasury and a blip on exxon’s mammoth balance sheet but it came as controversy over russia policy has engulfed washington the trump administration is facing questions about russia’s intervention in the  election and congress has considered stiffening sanctions out of concern that president trump will try to ease those already in placethe move also underscores concerns over mr tillerson’s deep business connections in russia“exxon mobil demonstrated reckless disregard for us sanctions requirements” the treasury said in a report announcing the penalty “exxon mobil caused significant harm to the ukrainerelated sanctions program”hal eren a former official in treasury’s office of foreign assets control said the fine showed that the department’s staff members would not be cowed advertisement continue reading the main story “it gives the message that they’re going to do what they have to even though rex tillerson is secretary of state” he said “perhaps it was a bit of assertion of independence by the staff of ofac” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story exxon violated sanctions imposed after russia’s armed actions against ukraine when presidents of the company’s american subsidiaries did business with individuals whose assets were blocked according to the foreign assets control unit the violations involved the signing of legal documents related to oil and gas projects in russia with igor sechin the head of rosneft the russian state oil company and another personmr tillerson had personal business dealings with mr sechin in  mr tillerson was awarded the russian government’s order of friendship after he signed deals with rosneft that opened the kara sea in the arctic to oil drillingmr tillerson was the only american official to join mr trump at a meeting with president vladimir v putin of russia at the group of  summit meeting in germany this monthrelations between the united states and russia have been strained

or contact us anytime american and european sanctions were imposed on russia in march  after moscow annexed crimea from ukraine even as the crisis in ukraine deepened exxon continued to press for deeper involvement in russia’s oil industrymr tillerson expressed opposition to the sanctions before they were tightened in late  at exxon’s annual meeting in  he said “we do not support sanctions generally because we don’t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively and that’s a very hard thing to do”the state department declined to comment on the penalty and referred questions to exxonin a statement exxon called the penalty “fundamentally unfair” the company also filed a lawsuit against the treasury challenging the finethe company said it had adhered to guidance from the white house and the treasury and that its representatives had done nothing wrong by signing documents related to active business with rosneft which was not blocked by sanctions mr sechin was acting in an official capacity exxon said not a personal one advertisement continue reading the main story in its suit exxon argues that the treasury penalty is out of sync with the guidance that the department and the white house provided when the sanctions were announced the company also notes that bp’s american chief executive was allowed to participate in rosneft board meetings with mr sechin so long as the activity involved rosneft business and not mr sechin’s personal businessa treasury official said the penalty came after a multiyear investigationit was not the first time in recent months that exxon has drawn attention for its handling of the russia sanctions in april the company asked the treasury for a waiver from sanctions against russia so it could drill in the black sea in a venture with rosneft stirring speculation that exxon hoped to influence the administration through its ties to mr tillerson that request was denied there were signs on thursday that the penalty could energize the push in congress for tougher sanctions against russia“i am disappointed that an american company would so clearly act in divergence from us national security interests” said senator ben cardin a maryland democrat “today’s news only underscores the urgency for new sanctions on russia that increase pressure on the country and tighten loopholes in existing sanctions” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go to home page » site index the new york times why is rex tillerson

june   photo by jabin botsfordthe washington post if you teach international relations you quickly develop an aversion to blackandwhite thinking you become comfortable in all of the shades of gray that’s because in foreign affairs there is rarely an obvious right call and an obvious wrong call in most situations the people who have to run foreign policy face difficult tradeoffs they have to make tough decisions whereas all i have to do is sit in the peanut gallery and crack wise i bring this up because every once in a while i look at what i have written about secretary of state rex tillerson and worry that i’ve abandoned all those shades of gray consider  a sampling of headlines from pieces focusing on him since january “where in the world is secretary of state rex tillerson“ “the dangerous trajectory of rex tillerson’s tenure“ “the beclowning of the executive branch“ “i was wrong about rex tillerson” an attempt at sarcasm “some pro bono management advice for rex tillerson“ “the vulgar realism of rex tillerson’s state department“ “i can’t stop laughing at the trump administration that’s not a good thing“ “my socalled secretary of state“ just scanning these headlines the academic in me thinks i am being too harsh on tillerson true it would seem that tillerson has been a bad secretary of state true it seems as though america’s influence in the world has been ebbing throughout  with the united states retreating from places as diverse as syria and burma and the hearts and minds of europeans true tillerson has advised trump so badly that the president keeps getting played on every highprofile foreign visit surely however there must be some rational explanation for why tillerson is doing what he’s doing right last week tillerson did provide a small window of his thinking to reporters after a failed effort at middle east shuttle diplomacy according to the los angeles times’s tracy wilkinson “well it is a lot different than being ceo of exxon because i was the ultimate decisionmaker” secretary of state rex tillerson said thursday in unusually candid comments to reporters… in his comments aboard his flight home tillerson said he did not mean to criticize the us government but that on a whole “it’s largely not a highly disciplined organization” “decisionmaking is fragmented and sometimes people don’t want to take decisions coordination is difficult through the interagency process” this is the stereotypical lament among the privatesector individuals who enter the public sector and it’s true crafting foreign policy requires cooperation among a decentralized batch of semifeudal bureaucracies so i get his frustrations in that area even though anyone who knows anything about foreign policy could have told him that this is the life the thing is tillerson is at the apex of the state department hierarchy he should be able to run foggy bottom similar to how he ran exxon but the steps he has taken this past week make no sense consider three stories about the state department in the last week  colum lynch “tillerson to shutter state department war crimes office” foreign policy secretary of state rex tillerson is downgrading the us campaign against mass atrocities shuttering the foggy bottom office that worked for two decades to hold war criminals accountable according to several former us officials… the decision to close the office comes at a time when america’s top diplomat has been seeking to reorganize the state department to concentrate on what he sees as key priorities pursuing economic opportunities for american businesses and strengthening us military prowess those changes are coming at the expense of programs that promote human rights and fight world poverty which have been targeted for steep budget cuts “there’s no mistaking it — this move will be a huge loss for accountability” said richard dicker the director of human rights watch’s international justice program the war crimes ambassador’s “organizational independence gave the office much more weight” he added  nick wadhams and nafeesa syeed “tillerson to shut cyber office in state department reorganization” bloomberg secretary of state rex tillerson is shutting down an office that coordinates cyber issues with other countries according to two people familiar with the plan in a move that critics said will diminish the us voice in confronting hackers the office of the coordinator for cyber issues established under president barack obama in  will be folded into the state department’s bureau of economic and business affairs according to the people who asked not to be identified in advance of an announcement the coordinator will no longer report directly to the secretary of state going instead through the bureau’s chain of command as tillerson pushes ahead with a departmentwide reorganization they said “it’s taking an issue that’s preeminent and putting it inside a backwater within the state department” said robert knake a senior fellow for cybersecurity at the council on foreign relations in washington who was director of cybersecurity policy at the national security council under obama “position to power matters both within the us government and within the international community”  bethany allenebrahimian and robbie gramer “state department suspends yet another fellowship program” foreign policy the state department has suspended a program that fasttracks top recruits sparking outrage from students and graduates who planned on joining the diplomatic corps the diplomacy fellows program dfp established as part of thensecretary of state colin powell’s diplomatic readiness initiative in the early ’s allows recipients of several prestigious fellowship programs to fast track their applications to the elite foreign service branch — a notoriously longwinded process layered in bureaucratic red tape critics fear it could choke out the next generation of talented diplomats particularly while scores of senior foreign service officers are poised to retire and foggy bottom grapples with hemorrhaging talent amid morale problems and steep budget cut proposals “the us government has spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to train us” said one graduate student affected by the suspension who requested anonymity due to the sensitive of the application process “and they’re going to lose out because the most talented people are going to find something else to do” it’s that last quote that truly boggles the mind surely as ceo of exxonmobil tillerson had to know the value of being able to recruit toptier personnel it is already difficult to recruit top people for the public sector when their salaries languish compared to the private sector to quash the pipelines of human capital into the state department is straight out of dumb management  is it debatable whether tillerson meets the classic criteria of a secretary of state but there is no disputing that he is the ceo of the state department what however is he trying to do as the head of it how is he making it a better organization does he understand how the secretary of state exercises influence in the world every single step he has taken appears to weaken and undermine the very department he heads i simply do not understand why he is in charge of the state department i miss the color gray and so sometimes i worry that i am being too harsh on tillerson’s management of the state department increasingly however i worry that i am not being harsh enough  comments  share on facebookshare

most evident on this trip in hamburg according to a state official when trump was questioned about the qatar crisis he repeatedly responded that tillerson was handling it yet tillerson still has to fight against the perception that he’s on the outside looking in particularly when trump steps on his message with an impulsive tweet as he did during the early days of the qatar crisis siding with the saudis even as he offered tillerson up as a mediator “i don’t know anyone in the gulf—or anyone in the world—who believes you go to tillerson or the state department for decisions in the trump administration” chollet says “no one really knows if the president has his back”as much as the trip has shown that tillerson has come into the job it’s also provided hints about how much he misses his past life during a brief stop in istanbul he found time to accept an award from the world petroleum congress that had been bestowed on him before he became secretary of state rather than using it as a chance to talk about us energy policy tillerson delivered a brief speech that struck a wistful tone “i miss all of you” he said “i missed you as colleagues i miss you as partners i miss you as

he repeatedly responded that tillerson was handling it yet tillerson still has to fight against the perception that he’s on the outside looking in particularly when trump steps on his message with an impulsive tweet as he did during the early days of the qatar crisis siding with the saudis even as he offered tillerson up as a mediator “i don’t know anyone in the gulf—or anyone in the world—who believes you go to tillerson or the state department for decisions in the trump administration” chollet says “no one really knows if the president has his back”as much as the trip has shown that tillerson has come into the job it’s also provided hints about how much he misses his past life during a brief stop in istanbul he found time to accept an award from the world petroleum congress that had been bestowed on him before he became secretary of state rather than using it as a chance to talk about us energy policy tillerson delivered a brief speech that struck a wistful tone “i miss all of you” he said “i missed you as colleagues i miss you as partners i miss you as competitors” —with nafeesa syeed bottom line  after a rocky start as secretary of state tillerson is facing a key test

most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions—from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers in october  less than two months before his nomination as secretary of state he reaffirmed that exxonmobil believed a carbon tax would be “the best policy of those being considered replacing the hodgepodge of current

alternative method of carbon pricing a time magazine article in december  asserted that since tillerson announced his companys preference for a carbon tax exxonmobil has not made a carbon tax a focus of its massive lobbying efforts and has supported a number of candidates and organizations that oppose measures to tackle the climate change issue in  tillerson said that while he acknowledged that

tradeedit speaking in march  at a council on foreign relations event tillerson said should the united states seek socalled energy independence in an elusive effort to insulate this country from the impact of world events on the economy or should americans pursue the path of international engagement seeking ways to better compete within the global market for energy like the councils founders i believe we must choose the course of greater international engagement  the central reality is this the global free market for energy provides the most effective means of achieving us energy security

more for some new breakthrough in energy to become the dominant source most people have difficulty coming to grips with the sheer enormity of energy consumption rex tillerson energy people picture integrity is essential and irreplaceable it is the most valuable asset for a person a company or a society seeking to build and progress rex tillerson integrity progress society experience tells us that a good foundation is critical for success in the arctic and elsewhere exxonmobils sakhalin project with rosneft is an example where we have put this experience to work rex tillerson work success good natural gas obviously brings with it a number of qualityoflife environmental benefits because it is a relatively cleanburning fuel it has a co footprint but it has no particulates it has none of the other emissions elements that are of concern to public health that other forms of powergeneration fuels do have coal fuel oil others rex tillerson health environmental oil changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around  well adapt to that its an engineering problem and it has engineering solutions rex tillerson changes weather problem compromise on ethical conduct is

the worlds population is likely to increase by about  billion people with also projected economic output will be up about  percent versus the year  rex tillerson world population people if you ask the average person on the street about us energy and us oil in particular our situation most americans would say oh were energy poor we dont have enough oil we dont have enough natural gas rex tillerson

afford they need fuel to cook their food on thats not animal dung rex tillerson food world animal you know oil prices from  on the strength of a very robust global economy and a very robust emerging china many of you will recall ramped up to near  a barrel then we had the financial  us financial collapse oil prices collapsed all the way down to  a barrel rex tillerson strength financial know none

fossil fuels you can be afraid of a lot of things that you dont understand rex tillerson you understand afraid there are a thousand ways you can be told no in this country rex tillerson you country thousand in the business world we can point to instances when a lack of integrity has bankrupted entire companies  in sectors as different as finance telecommunications manufacturing and energy rex tillerson business integrity finance throughout my life and career i have continually been impressed with the importance of integrity  whether it was growing up as a boy scout working in one of my first jobs as a university janitor or being a leader in a fortune  company rex tillerson life integrity leader i never saw a bureaucracy produce a single barrel of oil rex tillerson single bureaucracy oil because we have a society that by and large is illiterate in these areas  science math and engineering  what we do is a mystery to them and they find it scary and because of that it creates easy opportunities for opponents of development activist organizations to manufacture fear rex tillerson fear science opportunities the consequences of a misstep in a well while large to the immediate
