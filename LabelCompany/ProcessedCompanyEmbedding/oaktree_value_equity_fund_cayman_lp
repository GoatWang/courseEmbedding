equities value equities multistrategy solutions home strategies listed equities value equities value equities oaktree launched the value equity strategy in  as a stepout from our industryleading distressed debt platform like the distressed and value opportunities strategies value equities employs a bottomup valueoriented investment approach focused on longterm principal appreciation and preservation of capital the strategy seeks to achieve attractive riskadjusted returns by opportunistically assembling and managing an unleveraged concentrated portfolio of stressed postreorganization and value equities that offer asymmetric return profiles central to the strategy’s process is the identification of sound companies with substantial asset values or business franchises that are trading at a sizable discount to longterm intrinsic value due to shortterm adversity or uncertainty “identifying and investing in a concentrated portfolio of outoffavor stocks is value equities’ key to generating alpha” says portfolio manager patrick mccaney “this is in contrast to managing a highly diversified equity fund where returns are generally far more betadriven” he adds the strategy’s broad charter allows the team to look at equities across industries market capitalizations and geographies within developed markets one of the strategy’s greatest assets is its daily collaboration with oaktree’s experienced and highly regarded distressed debt team for supplemental industry and analytical insights in value investing opportunities click here for information regarding risk
