marketing new products across the country marketing expert neeli bendapudi explains what makes a good test city and what its like to be the first to try new foods and products neal conan host the old marketing adage asks will it play in peoria but for years test city usa has been right here in columbus ohio central ohioans got to try the latest innovations in fast food and groundbreaking new products like cube tv which you may not remember these days columbus ranks a little lower on the test market scale albany new york now tops the list new york city oh you sophisticates is now ranking at the bottom weve invited neeli bendapudi to join us  shes professor of marketing at the ohio state university  to tell us what makes a good test market we want to hear what products have been tested where you live the phone number  email us talknprorg you can also join the conversation on our web site thats at nprorg click on talk of the nation neeli bandapudi is with us here at wosu thanks very much for coming in professor neeli bandapudi marketing ohio state university thank you neal its a pleasure to be here conan so for those of us not schooled in marketing what are test markets for prof bandapudi well test markets are really to help you weed out products that you think will not be successful on a large scale as you know introducing a new product is a formidable task lots of money lots of time goes into it and therefore before you make that big plunge the big investment to go national companies want to see whether the products play and its just not always just an go nogo decision its also to see whether some tweaks could be made to the product or to the messaging conan should we call it new and improved or improved and new prof bandapudi thats correct indeed conan and so this is like focus grouping on a huge scale prof bandapudi well theres one big difference in a focus group you are discussing the concept the idea do you like it in a test market you have the advantage of actually having it in the store and having real consumers spend their dollars to say yes or no theres actually an in between the simulated test market where you could go in and virtually buy or not buy but this is you go in to the store and buy the product as you normally would conan real dollars for real products prof bandapudi real dollars real products conan and so this gives you information you can see how it compares with sales if youre selling soap detergent you can see how it compares to tide or all or any of those other products are you gaining market share that sort of thing prof bandapudi absolutely so you might say these are the growth goals we have for this product is this  does this look promising will it get us there or as you said will it cannibalize our own sales will it draw new customers lots of reasons why you want to go into a test market conan and what made columbus such a good one prof bandapudi well for a long time when you think about what makes for a good test market you really want to see if its representative of the population you know the customer base that you eventually want to get to conan mmhmm prof bandapudi so columbus middle america it was the idea that it truly was representative of the broader trends of the nation and of course its not just that you want to make sure that its a location where its not dominated by one employer or one cause because you want to get a variety of opinions there maybe its the demographics of the people that youre trying to reach and also a variety of shopping outlets and a variety of media outlets so you can see how it would actually play conan mmhmm because advertising  theres no point in just putting it in the store you got to let people know its there prof bandapudi indeed without that you know you might not be very successful but heres an interesting thing about market testing though in advertising and the promotions that go on you cannot have way too much of it it needs to be as realistic to your eventual goals as possible so lets say i think im test marketing a product and therefore i pour in a ton of marketing dollars well the sales might look very good but eventually when i take it national thats not going to be very representative conan so therefore one of the things youd actually like is a market where the advertising rates are not prohibitive you dont want to test market new york city thats expensive airtime prof bandapudi well well well as you said it new york use sophisticates right its not just the cost you also want to say are those tastes similar will they generalize are they replicable so the big thing is for a long time it used to be how representative is the city of the national trends but i would say more importantly how representative is it of the particular customer segment you want to target conan because some products are not aiming for everybody theyre going for a niche a portion of the population prof bendapudi thats exactly right conan and what  why is columbus now falling in the rankings prof bendapudi well i think that a variety of reasons we have  maybe part of the cost that you talked about its also which type of product is tested here columbus still seem  tends to be very highly ranked in food testing different fast food concepts its always been very popular  because of the taste being more generalizable and unintelligible conan so if theres a crunchy burrito youre going to get it first prof bendapudi you are going to get it first soundbite of laughter prof bendapudi so whatever new idea there is its probably being tested here and then of course just the fact that you may find so many products being test marketed that theres reason to go out into other markets conan well lets get callers in from some of those other markets and find out what other products have been tested there whats been tested where you live  email us talknprorg jim is on the line from grand haven in michigan jim caller hi thanks for taking my call conan sure jim i live in grand haven and we seem to be kind of a hub for testing some food and drinks i know  i remember in particular vault the soft drink thats kind of like mountain dew was tested here i think its probably because we get a lot of tourists during the summer coming up were the coast guard city of the usa conan mmhmm jim and we get a lot of tourism from the chicago area so we get a lot of companies coming out here to test their products and see what a crosssection of the midwest would enjoy conan jim i regret to say ive never been to grand haven but i dont remember vault jim well obviously it hasnt stayed around very long but i do remember seeing it in stores and i remember very distinctly walking down on the boardwalk and some people just handing out some volt  say here try this conan well go ahead neeli prof bendapudi now thats  i do remember seeing vault too so its  this is actually the reason why you test market think about the hundreds of thousands of products that are introduced each year a very small minority actually survive and are around for us to talk about conan hmm okay jim thanks very much for the call jim thank you conan byebye lets see if we can go next to  will try rockph rocks with us from payson arizona rock caller hello hello gentleman conan go ahead please rock i happen to be one of those right on the firing line im an artist and years ago i was licensing with a company out of vermont  big licensing organization and they  sorry about that they actually were going to license one of my images of a rooster on one of these collector plates conan sure prof bendapudi hmm rock and so that was tested in the midwest and ironically they came back to us about two weeks after they started the testing and  they had tested it in another areas  but they came back and they said you know you must have a lot of relatives back here in the midwest and i said well what do you mean they said because the plates tested out real well here in one area but it didnt in the rest of the areas so that was kind of short lived testing conan oh thats  so they didnt decide to distribute it rock no and it was a beautiful image i got a few of my images in that trust me they are highly collectible now because there arent very many of them out there soundbite of laughter conan so theres one little city in the midwest that has these collectible items because there are not going to be any others soundbite of laughter rock yeah yeah thats about the way it worked out conan rock thanks very much and better luck next time soundbite of laughter rock thanks a lot conan byebye well that sounds like a marketing exemplar he did well in one place but not so good in the other hey we cant go with it prof bendapudi well the interesting thing is that they dropped it because you suddenly could segment and say its doing particularly well in this area so maybe the rooster does well in the midwest and some other figurine in somewhere else so they  you could decide to focus regionally rather than nationally when you have test like that conan lets go next to jeff  excuse me  michael michael with us from des moines michael caller hi neal we have a lot of jello i remember even one year des moines was considered the jello capital of the world we even had family come up from louisiana for thanksgiving and we go to the grocery store and they were looking in the aisles they were just floored at the options and different flavors that we had available to us that theyve never heard of conan and i also recall uses for jello that ive encountered in iowa that ive not encountered anywhere else for example congealed salad michael oh absolutely with the fruits and everything else put inside of it conan just about everything else soundbite of laughter michael yes and i have heard of vault also so im pretty sure des moines a test nation… conan well its probably that im not up on the latest mountain dewtype drinks so thats entirely possible michael i have a teenager maybe thats my thing conan okay prof bendapudi well you know what teenagers are great test markets so they can tell you what the trends will be michael it is an excellent category i love listening to your show never boring  so… soundbite of dial tone conan well apparently boring there soundbite of laughter conan we thank you very much for the call appreciate it lets see if we can go next to portland oregon and this is jeffph on the line jeff caller hello conan hi jeff jeff in the mid s here in portland one of the major soft drink companies test marketed a beverage called ok beautiful package you know can and nice logo but the poor drink tasted terrible prof bendapudi what kind of drink was it jeff it was kind of a  it was a carbonated colaish beverage but it just didnt have a compellingly good taste conan hmm prof bendapudi and i wonder its calling it… jeff in fact i was like what in the world am i drinking you know why am i drinking this and set it aside prof bendapudi hmm conan okay i think neeli was about to say it does not sound like a truly compelling name either jeff well it was cute and again the can and the packaging was well designed so… conan but doesnt it seem you know hey try it pick up a can of mediocre prof bendapudi thats right were not bad jeff well at the time it seems you know what can i say i bought one i bought it on a gamble so hey… conan hey  well you tried it prof bendapudi right but you know what this is an excellent point whether the packaging is cute or the name is great or the advertising is great we can only get you to test the product and if the product did sell  the core product isnt great no amount of marketing or advertising hopefully is going to overcome that because ultimately the product has too meet that taste test and be more than okay jeff i vaguely remember… conan jeff thanks very much for the call jeff …a slow  and old saw that said the best way to kill a bad product is to market it well prof bendapudi i love it i completely agree with that conan thanks very much our guest is neeli bendapudi whos a professor of marketing at the ohio state university youre listening to talk of the nation from npr news and neeli you live here in… prof bendapudi i do and i love it conan and  well what have you tested prof bendapudi well i can tell you a product that i have not tested  but because its been in the news quite a bit lately this is dissolvable tobacco have you heard of this conan i have not prof bendapudi there you go so one of the products that rj reynolds is testing in our marketplace over the last several months is tobacco that looks like a mint and the idea is that you dont want  you dont want to have secondhand smoke you dont want to be chewing spitting whatever conan dipping or anything prof bendapudi absolutely so this is a mint that supposedly dissolves and gives you the same amount of nicotine and its been somewhat controversial as you can imagine conan i can imagine yes prof bendapudi but thats a product that is being tested  started in columbus and now they have taken the test to a few other places as well conan have you tried it prof bendapudi no im  no thank you soundbite of laughter conan they might run in to a little resistance with that one prof thats right conan lets try jeanph jean with us from anchorage jean caller hello professor and thank you for taking my call i actually the conversation that i wanted to mention was tang i think it was general foods came up years ago maybe   years  im a sociologist at the research company and they wanted to study alaskan natives and american indians consumption of this product that  tang you know that they  its a solid then turns into a liquid conan invented for the space program as i recall jean exactly and where they wanted to test it was in rural alaska and i said well why dont you just go to the bingo halls that we have all over the state because in fact thats where people hang out i think one of the things they learned was it wasnt just american indians and alaskan natives but it was more of a rural phenomenon that the people in fact you know needed the product to be dry to get it to them and then… conan i see it goes to lower transportation costs  first of all to get it to alaska in the first place and then to ship it out into the rural markets jean exactly i think that was learning there but i also have worked with professor bendapudi and other projects up here in anchorage alaska i dont know if you remember me professor prof bendapudi oh my goodness i  yes from a long time ago we corresponded  email and weve talked  yes jean yes we have thank you for remembering that but… prof bendapudi i do jean …a great show love to watch you  listen to you guys youre my favorite conan well greetings from columbus jean and im actually from cleveland ohio so i just wanted to unintelligible prof bendapudi i know i know thats correct and by the way no one has to call me professor for today it can be neal and neeli so you dont have to worry about the bendapudi jean well i love your work from ohio state and we have watched you from afar and alaska is an interesting market i think  i always refer to us as the next melting pot of america partly because so many people have come from so many different places and end up in alaska particularly in anchorage the big city here and it is a great test market site because we come from as far as michigan ohio all along california texas you know the industries that we have here bring people from all over the world so there are times you know where we have large groups of people for instance theres been some fish products that have been studied with the asian populations were one of the top country in asian populations so again people dont think of us as that but in fact we are quite a melting pot here in anchorage conan though a lot of people in alaska say  well anchorage isnt representative of alaska its los anchorage its the big city anyway thanks very much for the call jean jean thank you guys conan lets see if we can get one more caller in and lets go to battle creek michigan amanda and amanda its got to be about cereal right amanda caller oh of course it is i moved about three years ago to battle creek and find that the cereal stores are stocked with the boxes with yellow stripes that says new and much to my annoyance i live  my husband is one of those guys that is just  if it says new on it hes got to buy it and try it so… soundbite of laughter amanda weve tried plenty of their new cereals conan how many different varieties of cornflakes can there be amanda im sure that theres more every day and the best part about battle creek is unintelligible you can smell it so its that close by conan all right amanda thanks very much for the call appreciate it amanda mmhmm conan and our thanks to our guest neeli bendapudi the neal and
