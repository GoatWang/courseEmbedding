hold the cabinet post former governor cecil andrus was the secretary of the interior under president jimmy carter serving from  to  upon kempthornes appointment as secretary of the interior environmental groups characterized him as someone who has almost always favored changing laws like the endangered species act and the safe drinking water act to make them more favorable to commercial interests as secretary of the interior kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on may   as of september  kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any interior secretary in united states history a record previously held by james g watt for over  years in december  as a result of a longterm investigation and resignation of former deputy assistant secretary julie macdonald inspector general earl devaney found abrupt and abrasive if not abusive management at the department under kempthornes supervision us senator ron wyden chairman of the senate subcommittee on public lands and forests attributed the untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers dollars to macdonalds actions of the department representative nick j rahall ii chairman of the house natural resources said the results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the interior department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another’s misdeeds in september  devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the minerals management service an agency under kempthornes administration that collects about  billion in oil and gas royalties annually and one of the government’s largest sources of revenue other than taxes according to the new york times eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf ski and paintball outings meals and drinks and tickets to a toby keith concert a houston texans football game and a colorado rockies baseball game the investigation also concluded that several of the officials frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions had used cocaine and marijuana and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives the new york times reports a whistle blower officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of  prior to kempthornes being sworn into the office secretary of the interior dirk kempthorne joins federal and island leaders for a group picture at the insular areas health summit on december   the center for biological diversity announced intent to sue the interior department under kempthorne for introducing regulations that would eviscerate our nation’s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities including those that generate greenhouse gases from review under the endangered species act the lawsuit which is critical of policy advocated by kempthorne and president george w bush was filed in the northern district of california by the cbd greenpeace and defenders of wildlife according to the cbd the lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the endangered species act and did not go through the required public review process the regulations first proposed on august th were rushed by the bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than  comments from the public were reviewed in  weeks and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment rather than a fuller environmental impact statement kempthornes appointment was contentious from the beginning because of his history of receiving large campaign contributions from corporations based in boise many of whom were natural resource extractive industries such as boisecascade timber or companies with a long history of epa violations jr simplot corporation among his many other previous large campaign contributors were hecla mining asarco and fmc gold when confronted with the issue of his close connections to environmentally damaging industries by his idaho constituents and lobbyists seeking measures of environmental preservation and protection kempthorne was known to simply walk out of the room without saying a word leaving members of the public to be ushered out by his pages kempthornes reputation grew to a man known for fostering intimate coziness and open door policies with corporations irresponsibly handling particularly the us wests natural resources to one who would simply ignore the vary individuals affected by and knowledgeable of the corresponding environmental degradation in  cnn correspondent campbell brown criticized kempthorne for using  of taxpayer money to renovate his office bathroom at the department of interior according to brown the costs included a shower a refrigerator and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling as well as dk monogrammed towels donald swain chief of the interior departments national business center said the towels do not exist he further says the

of service to state nation may   dirk kempthorne has always wanted to help people “it probably comes from how my mom and dad raised me i’ve always had a deep respect for other people” said kempthorne who served as governor of idaho from  “i’ve always believed that you should make a difference wherever you are” that belief led kempthorne to enroll as a premed major at the university of idaho in the s as well as an orderly at gritman medical center in moscow but as he pursued the medical field he found his interests shifting “i started out as a premed student and i didn’t do really well in physics or in chemistry” he said “and then i kept finding that rather than go to the fourth floor of the library — where the medical books were — i kept ending up on the third floor in the political science books”  kempthorne switched his major to political science and earned his bachelor’s degree from what is now the college of letters arts and social sciences class in  two years later on sept  he married another ui graduate patricia merrill at sunrise on top of nearby moscow mountain this may kempthorne will return to ui and finally receive the title “doctor” although still not in medicine the university has awarded kempthorne an honorary doctor of administrative science he will receive the honor during the commencement ceremony may  in moscow “it’s come full circle i go to ui to become a doctor i switch from premed to political science but i’m now being invited back to become a doctor” he said kempthorne was nominated for the award by class dean andrew kersten who wanted to acknowledge the many contributions kempthorne has made to the university the palouse and the state “i greatly appreciate the efforts of dean kersten and president chuck staben i am so greatly honored to receive this recognition from my alma mater” kempthorne said  during his time as governor kempthorne championed an education safety initiative that led to a rebuilt troy high school and another investment project that remodeled ui’s teaching and learning center he also led the way on an investment in highway safety which resulted in  projects around the state — improvements that according to

probably comes from how my mom and dad raised me i’ve always had a deep respect for other people” said kempthorne who served as governor of idaho from  “i’ve always believed that you should make a difference wherever you are” that belief led kempthorne to enroll as a premed major at the university of idaho in the s as well as an orderly at gritman medical center in moscow but as he pursued the medical field he found his interests shifting “i started out as a premed student and i didn’t do really well in physics or in chemistry” he said “and then i kept finding that rather than go to the fourth floor of the library — where the medical books were — i kept ending up on the third floor in the political science books”  kempthorne switched his major to political science and earned his bachelor’s degree from what is now the college of letters arts and social sciences in  two years later on sept  he married another ui graduate patricia merrill at sunrise on top of nearby moscow mountain this may kempthorne will return to ui and finally receive the title “doctor” although still not in medicine the university has awarded kempthorne an honorary doctor of administrative science he will receive the honor during the commencement ceremony may  in moscow “it’s come full circle i go to ui to become a doctor i switch from premed to political science but i’m now being invited back to become a doctor” he said related links college of letters arts and social sciences department of politics and philosophy commencement  associated students of the university of idaho american council of life insurers dirk kempthorne close dirk kempthorne career in service the beginning of kempthorne’s selfproclaimed “unorthodox” career as an elected public servant began at ui when he was elected president of the associated students of the university of idaho asui while a student kempthorne championed the effort to construct the roof of the asuikibbie activity center the effort gave kempthorne the opportunity to practice what would become a signature of his political style diplomacy and a willingness to work with everyone “i went to every living group i met with all of them” kempthorne said “i discussed what the facts and figures were what the pluses and minuses were we got the support of the student body to proceed” in the s at age  kempthorne made his first run at public office for the boise mayor’s seat at the time kempthorne and patricia had two young children and kempthorne said he felt he could make a difference in boise a city he said was struggling to reach its full potential “the political wisdom was ‘do not do this’” kempthorne said he was told “it’s a job that you will not be successful in” and it would hurt his ability to run for statewide office “and with all of that good advice i made the decision to run for mayor” as mayor kempthorne championed the redevelopment of downtown boise including the construction of a longcontested events center that effort involved bringing together multiple governing bodies to reach an agreement “when i was mayor of boise i remember saying at the outset one of the most important things that we must build is cooperation because when you build cooperation then — and only then — can you can build with brick and mortar and that’s what we demonstrated in boise and that’s what we demonstrated throughout the state” he said in  kempthorne a republican was elected to the us senate where he earned a reputation for his bipartisanship particularly in efforts with democratic sen john glenn to curb unfunded government mandates in the late ’s kempthorne decided to leave washington dc and run for governor of idaho he was elected in  rebuilding idaho kempthorne has never been afraid to tackle big projects “when you see situations where perhaps results have eluded people i find those the most intriguing and the most challenging” kempthorne said “i approach them with a great deal of enthusiasm to see if we can’t find the solution” as governor of idaho kempthorne inherited a few big problems a backlog of unsafe public schools throughout the state and hazardous roads statewide he tackled the school safety issue by creating a statewide government and community partnership that led to the construction of such new schools as troy high school among other building improvements his passion to fix idaho’s highway system stemmed from personal experience while serving as asui president kempthorne and two other asui members were returning to moscow from a winter legislative trip to boise when their car went off the road “we hit a bad part of the road right there by banks on highway  the car flipped it rolled a number of times — and i can remember still the shock of that” kempthorne said “had it not been for the snowbanks we’d have gone right in to the river and that would have been it “i knew we needed to tackle the roads and so we did” kempthorne’s leadership resulted in  different projects around the state — improvements that according to the idaho transportation department and idaho state police save at least  lives per year many of those lives are idaho students traveling the highways to go home for holidays and breaks but the work didn’t come without compromise and politicians agreeing to work together at first the idaho house of representatives killed kempthorne’s road legislation when reporters asked kempthorne how it felt to see his work dismissed he said “well my mother and father taught me to believe in and practice the golden rule but i’ve now learned through this process sometimes you must simply rule” kempthorne selected eight pieces of legislation that simply awaited his signature and vetoed them announcing “i will continue this until we finally get some cooperation and communication around here” the road legislation was revived the next day planning for the future kempthorne was nominated to be the th secretary of the interior in  by president george w bush and confirmed by the us senate he continued his passionate service of people being a champion of the national park system and successfully getting the polar bear listed as a threatened species in  he stepped down from the department of interior and began a new phase of his career as president and ceo of the american council of life insurers acli — but the passion of his life remains unchanged “my motivation for  years of public service was to help people and with the life insurance industry — its mission is to help people” kempthorne said “and one of the things that probably i took away from working at gritman hospital was the experience of working with human beings they were in the hospital and did not feel well they need others to help them i saw what it was for the elderly that were frail and sometimes you saw concern in their eyes and one of the things that motivates me at acli is i think people should have dignity their entire life it shouldn’t be something where you achieved the american dream you outlived your retirement savings and now your dignity is in question” acli represents nearly  member companies about  percent of the life insurance industry assets in the united states kempthorne is still focused on helping people tackling big problems and working across political labels to achieve his organization’s goals for ui students kempthorne has a few pieces of advice find your passion be a good listener and work with people who think differently than you do “go in first with the attitude that you will respect other views that you will be an active listener” kempthorne said “realize that if you will also set aside rhetoric and help diffuse rhetoric in others you will then achieve results and isn’t that why you went into service in the first place “it all boils down to people find the best in all of us sometimes it takes a little more effort in some — but if you can find that you can all celebrate the victory” article by savannah tranchell university communications  marketing dirk kempthornes portrait when he was asui president close dirk kempthornes portrait when he was asui president contact

buzzflash and wonkette readers you might want to bookmark this page and check back for updates it is widely rumored that dirk kempthorne has an illegitimate child i used quotes because i loathe that word the one person it hurts most is the kid and they dont deserve it when dirk kempthorne went to dc as a senator he took a special aide with him while in dc dirk kempthorne was known as the kennedy of the republican party  and not for his stance on civil rights his exit from senatorial life was because dirks wife patricia kempthorne insisted that he end the affair andor the philandering in spite of that ultimatum the mistress followed dirk kempthorne back to idaho and currently lives either in boise or mccall the press has always shied away from this and details have always been sparse but maybe someone in boise or mccall rumored digs for the mistress and their child would assemble the details needed to break this story out and put the rovian spinmachine back off message for a few days at the least kempthornes nomination is an opportunity to videotape some obviouslylying nondenialdenials by key idaho republicans for use next fall during idaho wingnuts bigotry against gays marriage mudfest presuming patricia wont get interviewed by oprah or a cameo on desperate housewives kempthornes nomination leaves so many unanswered questions are the former aide and dirk junior going to be packing for the trip or will patricia be dirks only companion this time will kempthorne be like steve symms divorcing his seriouslyill wife or does he prefer patricia brush up on her tammy wynette singing while he enjoys a steady stream of minor dalliances a la butch otter with neocons and fundamentalists screaming about sanctity of marriage why do kempthorne otter and other idaho republicans hate the noble institution of marriage and the national question would a scandal like this shred another percentage point off bushs approval rating admittedly its such poor taste to distract the president from his two priorities iraq and the november elections a speech which immediately brought monty pythons spanish inquisition sketch to mind but i like to hope that each day the cheney administration is offmessage is another day alive for several iraqi civilians and iranians if so thatd almost be enough to attone for idaho wingnuts still mustering a  approval rating yesterday for bush at last well have a cabinet member that unabashedly likes their pages bent over and the left can argue that as a cabinet member dirk opens the chance that if someone has an affair well finally
