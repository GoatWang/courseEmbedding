we’re likely to see in the upcoming report stats on thompson creek metals analysts’ eps estimate  yearago eps  revenue estimate m change from yearago revenue  earnings beats in past four quarters  source yahoo finance has thompson creek metals finally turned the corner molybdenum has been one of the few bright spots of the resource sector over the past few months prices have soared more than  for the year to date as production cuts began to crimp supplies as any armchair mining analyst could tell you higher spot rates have had a positive impact on thompson creek’s bottom line in recent months bay street has been ratcheting up its expectations of its earnings going from a  per share loss for the second quarter to a current  per share profit for the full year the street is looking for the company to earn about  per share more than double the consensus estimate only  days ago however in spite of the company’s improving fundamentals the stock has been relatively tame up a meager  over the past three months while thompson creek metals is known for molybdenum the company is transforming into a more diversified miner the company’s secondquarter results showed the transition as mt milligan produced more than  dry tonnes of coppergoldsilver concentrate with mining production expected to ramp up through the rest of the year and  it should continue to post stellar earnings growth the key question for investors is how much mt milligan will affect the company’s production mix given that the mine has  billion pounds of copper reserves and management has sold off streaming interests to more than  of its gold production it’s evident that copper will drive the bulk of the company’s earnings in the near future eventually thompson creek metals is likely to join molycorp minerals canada ulc tsx nemnyse mcp in having molybdenum make up only a small portion of its overall revenue stream in thompson creek’s upcoming report watch for the miner to give its latest update on mt milligan’s development and plans for further production increases investors will also want to get a sense for what management plans to do as payments from the mine’s production start rolling in shareholders should expect that executives will use the proceeds to pay down debt and shore up its balance sheet but they may have other plans  more commodity names to add to your watch list check out
