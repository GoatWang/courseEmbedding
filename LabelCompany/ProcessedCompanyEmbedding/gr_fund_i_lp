look for in a venture capital fund manager  the equity kicker the equity kicker no menu assigned what does an lp look for in a venture capital fund manager by nic brisbournedecember   questions venture capital  comments   sixth in a series of weekly posts by myself and nicholas lovell of gamesbrief which answer the fifty questions you should ask before raising venture capital  we expect the series to run for a year after which we will collate the posts into a book  you can find the rationale behind the series here and the list of questions here  we welcome your comments on any and every aspect of what we are doing ————————————— let me start by explaining two terms in the question  ‘lp’ is a generic term for an investor in a venture capital fund typically they are pension funds or insurance companies otherwise known as ‘institutional investors’ but they can also be corporates wealthy individuals or governments looking to stimulate the startup ecosystem  lp is short for limited partner a reference to the legal status of investors in venture capital funds – technically they are partners in the fund with limited rights and obligations  i covered this in a little more detail when i answered the question where do vcs get their money from a ‘venture capital fund manager’ or sometimes ‘venture capitalist’ is the team of people that decide which companies to invest in and then manage them to exit they are often known as the ‘gp’ or ‘general partner’  a gp can have multiple funds under management at any one time and they are compensated according to the terms of the gp agreement for each fund which determines the fees and profit share they receive  i covered this in a little more detail when i answered the question what is venture capital turning to the question du jour the first thing that an lp looks for in a venture capital fund manager is track record  in venture capital past success is a very good indicator of future success unlike many other asset classes  entrepreneurs like to work with investors who have shown an ability to make money and hence vcs with a good track record stand a better than average chance of getting into the best deals and therefore making more money  additionally vcs who have had good success have typically built strong networks on the back of that success and are more able to help their companies with introductions to customers and partners the next thing an lp will look for is to see that the team has worked together before  ideally they have all worked together in the same manager and developed a good track record together  alternatively if the individuals have worked together in past lives then that might be enough to get the lp comfortable after that the lp will look to the fund structurestrategy – how many investments of what size and in which geographies and sectors the fund manager intends to make  there are some basics that have to be got right – eg the team needs to be large enough to make the planned number of investments when taking into account their commitments to earlier funds the fees need to be sufficient to cover the planned expenses of the manager  some other elements are more subjective and will appeal differently to different lps – eg which sectors the gp intends to invest in cleantech internet etc finally if the lp is comfortable on the three items above they will start to look to the terms of the venture fund of which the most important by far are the fees typically  of funds under management and the profit share or carried interest typically  of profits often after a basic return has been delivered  lps look through these percentages to see how much money the partners in the gp will get and as a result larger funds are usually nearer the bottom of the ranges given whilst smaller funds are able to get nearer the top  more successful funds are able to command higher fees and carry the first three items track record team history strategy are typically go or nogo gating items whereas the terms are more of a negotiation  related articles where do vcs get their money from theequitykickercom is venture capital right for your company theequitykickercom what is venture capital theequitykickercom is inlab’s vc  the cure for what’s ailing the venture capital game dailyfinancecom the right amount of venture capital to raise acquiacom httpwwwgamesbriefcom nicholas lovell the “good vcs get better deals” is an interesting angle when it comes to luck in other words you could say that the secret to being a good vc is to get lucky once because once you have a reputation for being lucky lps and entrepreneurs want to talk to you of course i don’t believe in luck or rather i believe luck happens and lucky people are those who find ways to be open to lucky situations so vcs more than most need to open to the possibility of black swans and be ready to capitalise on that success httpwwwalanodeacom alanodea guys great work so far my one comment about this recent post is simplay to ask is this not a bit high level for a focus on the games industry and a book not all games industry guys get vc that got to be like  of all games companies raise form institutions moreover i think it’s a bit high level to be talking about where vc’s get their money and the value chain of the vc industry it might be more valuable to focus on what sort of funding levels vcs look to invest at and what sort of returns and equity splits their looking at ie more tactical and less strategic vc value chain issues as a games company owner looking for funding i don’t need to know where vc’s money comes from i am much more interested in their measures and criteria from investment httpwwwalanodeacom alanodea hey guys great series and articles so far my comment is about relevance for this post if the series is fifty questions you should ask before raising venture capital it might be more valuable to focus on what sort of questions to ask your potential vc partner ie more tactical advice and less strategic and vc value chain issues as a company owner looking for funding i don’t care where my vc money comes i’ve never had had my board members investors cofounders or managers ask me about what a lp is and how a vc raises its money nor am i going to be sitting down over tea talking to vc partners about their own fund raising struggles strategies and hardships 🙂 i wouldn’t expect my vc to share that information with me or any other company or company owner looking to raise money with them if it is fifty question you should ask before raining venture capital the next questions in the series to my mind are filling in more detail on what a vc is looking for and what does it involve for a company owner when and if they decide to chase and secure vc funding so questions such as • how much do they invest • what are the typical format and criteria for investment • what returns and timeframes do they expect a company to deliver • how will they work with the company ie does investment require board positions special share privileges and voting right • what is the general process of getting vc investment • how long will it take beyond that if you think it’s really important to focus on lp’s and talk about the fact that vc’s manage their own investors funds then a further output of this post might be some questions a company owner should ask when performing diligence on their potential vc investor • has the vc currently got a viable fund under management • can they invest • what will they invest in • how much of that fund is current invested and not invested • when does the current fund end • when are they expecting to see returns on that fund for their own investors • what terms and roi are they supposed to deliver to their investors • what other companies have they invested in for that fund • how many failures successes and exits have they achieved so far with their fund • can i talk to owners of other companies in the fund and have you got contacts for them a good vc should have all of this information on hand and a good entrepreneur founder should have these questions lined up if their getting to a term sheet with a vc httpwwwtheequitykickercom brisbourne luck begets success and success begets success so you are right as a vc you don’t get that many chances to be lucky though so you have to maximise your chances of being fortunate by a being smart and getting into places where you are more likely to be lucky and b working hard and being busy – so you are in more of those places
