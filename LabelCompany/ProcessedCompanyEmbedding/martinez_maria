legacy of fine artwork and crafts martinez was from the san ildefonso pueblo a community located  miles northwest of santa fe new mexico at an early age she learned pottery skills from her aunt during this time spanish tinware and anglo enamelware had become readily available in the southwest making the creation of traditional cooking and serving pots less necessary traditional pottery making

approximately  at the de young museum in san francisco during an excavation in  led by edgar lee hewett a professor of archaeology and the founder and director of the museum of new mexico in santa fe examples of blackonblack pottery were discovered while searching through the sandy dirt and red clay of the new mexico desert terrain broken pieces of polished jetblack pottery were uncovered peterson  at this time few people were aware that during the neolithic period the pueblo peoples crafted this style of finished ware the historical pottery of the pueblo indians  text states that the finished  pottery held a glossy melted appearance which was only used for decoration on the pots it is a common misconception that during the end of the th century the use of plant pigments and finely powdered mineral substances became the preferred technique of painting and slowly caused the extinction of glazed pottery frank and harlow  in reality the nearby inhabitants of santa clara pueblo were still producing the highly burnished black on black pottery since the s therefore lending to the revival of the san ildefonso style of black on black painted pottery the only difference between the two pueblos styles is that in santa clara pots are deeply carved and incised whereas in san ildefonso the pottery is generally not carved and painted with pigments to cause unpolished designs on a polished surface hewett sought a skilled pueblo potter who could recreate this ancient pottery style his intention was to place recreated pots in museums and thus preserve the ancient art form maria martinez was known in the tewa pueblo of san ildefonso new mexico for making the thinnest pots in the least time therefore hewett saw her as the perfect pueblo potter to bring his idea to life challenges and experimentsedit a long process of experimentation and overcoming challenges was required to successfully recreate the blackonblack pottery style to meet maria’s exacting standards as almost all clay found in the hills is not jet black one specific challenge was to figure out a way to make the clay turn the desired color maria discovered from observing the tafoya family of santa clara pueblo who still practiced traditional pottery techniques that smothering the fire surrounding the pottery during the outdoor firing process caused the smoke to be trapped and is deposited into the clay creating various shades of black to gunmetal color  she experimented with the idea that an unfired polished red vessel which was painted with a red slip on top of the polish and then fired in a smudging fire at a relatively cool temperature would result in a deep glossy black background with dull black decoration shards and sheep and horse manure placed around the outside and inside of the outdoor kivastyle adobe oven would give the pot a slicker matte finished appearance after much trial and error maria successfully produced a black ware pot the first pots for a museum were fired around  these pots were undecorated unsigned and of a generally rough quality the earliest record of this pottery was in a july  exhibition held at the new mexico museum of art  encouragementedit embarrassed that she could not create high quality black pots in the style of the ancient pueblo peoples martinez hid her pots away from the world a few years later hewett and his guests visited the little tewa pueblo these guests asked to purchase black ware pottery similar to martinezs pots housed in a museum she was greatly encouraged by this interest and resolutely began trying to perfect the art of black ware pottery her skill advanced with each pot and her art began to cause quite a stir among collectors and developed into a business for the black ware pottery in addition martinez began experimenting with various techniques to produce other shapes and colorful forms of pottery description of black ware potteryedit maria and julian martinez matteonglossy blackware wedding vase ca  collection of the fred jones jr museum of art an olla jar has a slightly flattened rim and a marked angle at the shoulder the one created by maria and julian martinez is decorated on the rims only above the angle of the shoulder with continuous paneled bands light is reflected off of the shiny smooth surface the jet black ceramic product’s finish appears unblemished in any way a band of a lighter black decoration stands out against a solid black matte background the pot “depends on the decorative effect of the manipulation of the surface finish alone” to appear as though the decorations are scratched into the pot’s surface the band wraps directly below the narrow neck of the pot a wideeyed avanyu or horned serpent encircles the pot and slithers inside the band the serpents tongue almost touches the tip of his tail the snakes body movements seem alive a tribute to the appreciation the pueblo peoples have for nature and life the decorations on the pot give the pot a personality and unique individualized look processedit creating black ware pottery is a long process consisting of many steps requiring patience and skill six distinct processes occur before the pot is ready to be sold according to susan peterson in the living tradition of maria martinez these steps include “finding and collecting the clay forming a pot scraping and sanding the pot to remove surface irregularities applying the ironbearing slip and burnishing it to a high sheen with a smooth stone decorating the pot with another slip and firing the pot the first step in creating a pot is gathering the clay the clay is gathered once a year usually in october when it is dry and stored in an old weathered adobe structure where the temperature remains constant when martinez is ready to begin molding the clay to form a pot the right amount of clay is brought into the house a cloth laid upon a table holds a mound of gray pink sand with a fist hole in the center filled with an equal amount of blue sand a smaller hole is made in the blue sand and water is poured into the hole the substances are then all kneaded together picked up within the cloth washed and covered with a towel to prevent moisture from escaping where the clay will sit for a day or two to dry the pukis or the supporting mold a dry or fired clay shape where a round bottom of a new piece may be formed builds the base shape of the pot looking like a pancake after squeezing the clay together with ones fingers a wall is pinched up about an inch high from the pancake base a gourd rib is used in crosscrossing motions to smooth out the wall making it thick and even coiling long tube shapes of clay on the top of the clay wall and then smoothing it out with the gourd increases the pot’s height air holes are patched with extra clay and sealed away with the gourd rib like a patch being sewn on a pair of blue jeans after drying the pot is scraped sanded and polished with stones this is the most time consuming part of the entire process a small round stone should be applied to the side of the pot in a consistent horizontal rhythmic motion rubbing the stone parallel with the side of the pot produces a shiny polished even look creating the polished finish with the stone is called burnishing the pot is finally ready to fire after the secondary slip is applied by painting onto the burnished surface various traditional designs firingedit when firing the pots maria martinez used a firing technique called fire reduction a reduction atmosphere occurs when the amount of available oxygen is reduced the firing was a very long process that would take hours the day of in addition to the months of preparation beforehand she would often receive help from either her husband or her children the firing had to be done early in the morning on a clear calm day when wind would not hinder the process they started by carefully placing all of the pots to be fired in a fire pit and then covered them carefully with broken pieces of pottery and aluminum sheets or any metal scraps they could find in order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning they left small spaces uncovered after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips  very dry cow dung  used to fuel the fire careful to leave the vents free the goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots hence the protective metal sheets after covering the kiln with the cow chips they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat they continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around  to  degrees fahrenheit depending on what look they were attempting if the fire continued to burn the pottery would achieve a redbrown color but in order to make the black pottery that maria was famous for the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung by doing this the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black after several hours they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly after the kiln had cooled enough they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot or waiting until they were cool enough to touch  during the process of firing they didnt know whether the pots would make it or not decorationsedit julian martinez marias husband began attempting to decorate the pots she made although julian did eventually master decorating techniques for maria’s pots the process consisted of many trials and errors to create his designs a slurry of clay and water known as slip is created and applied to the already burnished but yet unfired surface you cannot polish a design into a matte background as the stone is not as precise as a brush is he discovered that after the guaco juice burned out from the heat of the fire he could mix the guaco with clay which then provided the perfect paint for his decorations the process julian settled on was to polish the background first then matte paint the decoration in the negative in  julian finished the first decorated black ware pot with a matte background and a polished avanyu design still achieved by painting the background on an already burnished surface the first rush of water coming down an arroyo after a thunderstorm a symbol of thanksgiving and for water and rain was the interpretation by julian of an avanyu or a horned water serpent many of julian’s decorations were patterns adopted from ancient vessels of the pueblos some of the patterns consisted of birds road runner tracks rain feathers clouds mountains and zigzags or kiva steps the museum displayed the first two decorated black ware pots painted by julian signaturesedit maria signed her creations in different ways throughout her lifetime the signatures found on the bottom of the pottery help date the pieces of art maria and julian’s oldest work were all unsigned the two had no idea that their art would become so popular and did not feel it was a necessity to claim their work the unsigned pieces were most likely made between the years of  and  once maria gained success with her pottery she began signing her work as marie she thought that the name marie was more popular among the nonindian public than the name maria and would influence the purchasers more the pieces signed as marie date the pottery between  and  even though julian decorated the pots only maria claimed the work since pottery was still considered a woman’s job in the pueblo maria left julian’s signature off the pieces to respect the pueblo culture until  after that “marie  julian” remained the official signature on all of the pottery until julian’s death in  lori  maria’s family began helping with the pottery business after julian’s death from  to  maria’s son adam and his wife santana collected clay coiled polished decorated and fired pottery with maria adam took over his father’s job of collecting clay and painting the decorations “marie  santana” became the new signature on the pots for about thirty years maria signed her name as “marie” once her son popovi da began working alongside his mother maria began referring to herself as “maria” on the pottery they began cosigning their pieces around  as “mariapoveka” and “mariapopovi thus studying the signature on one of maria’s pots may give a hint at the completion date of the pottery since dates were not added to the pottery until recent years accomplishmentsedit although black ware pottery received a lot of success the true legend behind the pottery is maria martinez herself she won many awards and presented her pottery at many world fairs and received the initial grant for the national endowment for the arts to fund a martinez pottery workshop in  martinez passed on her knowledge and skill to many others including her family other women in the pueblo and students in the outside world when she was a young girl she had learned how to become a potter by watching her aunt nicolasa make pottery during the time that she developed what we now know as the san ildefonso style of traditional pottery she learned much from sarafina tafoya the pottery matriarch of neighboring santa clara pueblo see alsoedit cueva de la

pottery since the s therefore lending to the revival of the san ildefonso style of black on black painted pottery the only difference between the two pueblos styles is that in santa clara pots are

techniques that smothering the fire surrounding the pottery during the outdoor firing process caused the smoke to be trapped and is deposited into the clay creating various shades of black to gunmetal color  she experimented with the idea that an unfired polished red vessel which was painted with a red slip on top of the polish and then fired in a smudging fire at a relatively cool temperature would result in a deep glossy black background with dull black decoration shards and sheep and horse manure placed around the outside and inside of the outdoor kivastyle adobe oven would give the pot

pots in the style of the ancient pueblo peoples martinez hid her pots away from the world a few years later hewett and his guests visited the little tewa pueblo these guests asked to purchase black ware pottery similar to martinezs pots housed in a museum she was greatly encouraged by this interest and resolutely began trying to perfect the art of black ware pottery her skill advanced with each

seem alive a tribute to the appreciation the pueblo peoples have for nature and life the decorations on the pot give the pot a personality and unique individualized look processedit creating black ware pottery is a long process consisting of many steps requiring patience and skill six distinct processes occur before the pot is ready to be sold according to susan peterson in the living tradition of maria martinez these steps include “finding and collecting the clay forming a pot scraping and sanding the pot to remove surface irregularities applying the ironbearing slip and burnishing it to a high sheen with a smooth stone decorating the pot with another slip and firing the pot the first step in creating a pot is gathering the clay the clay is gathered once a year usually in october when it is dry and stored in an old weathered adobe structure where the temperature remains constant when martinez is ready to begin molding the clay to form a pot the right amount of clay is brought into the house a cloth laid upon a table holds a mound of gray pink sand with a fist hole in the center filled with an equal amount of blue sand a smaller hole is made in the blue sand and water is poured into the hole the substances are then all kneaded together picked up within the cloth washed and covered with a towel to prevent moisture from escaping where the clay will sit for a day or two to dry the pukis or the supporting mold a dry or fired clay shape where a round bottom of a new piece may be formed builds the base shape of the pot looking like a pancake after squeezing the clay together with ones fingers a wall is pinched up about an inch high from the pancake base a gourd rib is used in crosscrossing motions to smooth out the wall making it thick and even coiling long tube shapes of clay on the top of the clay wall and then smoothing it out with the gourd increases the pot’s height air holes are patched with extra clay and sealed away with the gourd rib like a patch being sewn on a pair of blue jeans after drying the pot is scraped sanded and polished with stones this is the most time consuming part of the entire process a small round stone should be applied to the side of the pot in a consistent horizontal rhythmic motion rubbing the stone parallel with the side of the pot produces a shiny polished even look creating the polished finish with the stone is called burnishing the pot is finally ready to fire after the secondary slip is applied by painting onto the burnished surface various traditional designs firingedit when firing the pots maria martinez used a firing technique called fire reduction a reduction atmosphere occurs when the amount of available oxygen is reduced the firing was a very long process that would take hours the day of in addition to the months of preparation beforehand she would often receive help from either her husband or her children the firing had to be done early in the morning on a clear calm day when wind would not hinder the process they started by carefully placing all of the pots to be fired in a fire pit and then covered them carefully with broken pieces of pottery and aluminum sheets or any metal scraps they could find in order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning they left small spaces uncovered after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips  very dry cow dung  used to fuel the fire careful to leave the vents free the goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots hence the protective metal sheets after covering the kiln with the cow chips they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat they continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around  to  degrees fahrenheit depending on what look they were attempting if the fire continued to burn the pottery would achieve a redbrown color but in order to make the black pottery that maria was famous for the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung by doing this the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black after several hours they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly after the kiln had cooled enough they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot or waiting until they were cool enough to touch  during the process of firing they didnt know whether the pots would make it or not decorationsedit julian martinez marias husband began attempting to decorate the pots she made although julian did eventually master decorating techniques for maria’s pots the process consisted of many trials and errors to create his designs a slurry of clay and water known as slip is created and applied to the already burnished but yet unfired surface you cannot polish a design into a matte background as the stone is not as precise as a brush is he discovered that after the guaco juice burned out from the heat of the fire he could mix the guaco with clay which then provided the perfect paint for his decorations the process julian settled on was to polish the background first then matte paint the decoration in the negative in  julian finished the first decorated black ware pot with a matte background and a polished avanyu design still achieved by painting the background on an already burnished surface the first rush of water coming down an arroyo after a thunderstorm a symbol of thanksgiving and for water and rain was the interpretation by julian of an avanyu or a horned water serpent many of julian’s decorations were patterns adopted from ancient vessels of the pueblos some of the patterns consisted of birds road runner tracks rain feathers clouds mountains and zigzags or kiva steps the museum displayed the first two decorated black ware pots painted by julian signaturesedit maria signed her creations in different ways throughout her lifetime the signatures found on the bottom of the pottery help date the pieces of art maria and julian’s oldest work were all unsigned the two had no idea that their art would become so popular and did not feel it was a necessity to claim their work the unsigned pieces were most likely made between the years of  and  once maria gained success with her pottery she

the pottery between  and  even though julian decorated the pots only maria claimed the work since pottery was still considered a woman’s job in the pueblo maria left julian’s signature off the pieces to respect the pueblo culture until  after that “marie  julian” remained the official signature on all of the pottery until julian’s death in  lori  maria’s family began helping with the pottery

pottery ceramics movement san ildefonso school maria montoya martinez  san ildefonso pueblo new mexico – july   san ildefonso pueblo was a native american artist who created internationally known pottery martinez born maria antonia montoya her husband julian and other family members examined traditional pueblo pottery styles and techniques to create pieces which reflect the pueblo people’s legacy of fine artwork and crafts martinez was from the san ildefonso pueblo a community located  miles northwest of santa fe new mexico at an early age she learned pottery skills from her aunt during this time spanish tinware and anglo enamelware had become readily available in the southwest making the creation of traditional cooking and serving pots less necessary traditional pottery making techniques were being lost but martinez and her family experimented with different techniques and helped preserve the cultural art contents  discovery  challenges and experiments  encouragement  description of black ware pottery  process  firing  decorations  signatures  accomplishments  see also  notes  references  external links and references discoveryedit a pot by maria martinez approximately  at the de young museum in san francisco during an excavation in  led by edgar lee hewett a professor of archaeology and the founder and director of the museum of new mexico in santa fe examples of blackonblack pottery were discovered while searching through the sandy dirt and red clay of the new mexico desert terrain broken pieces of polished jetblack pottery were uncovered peterson  at this time few people were aware that during the neolithic period the pueblo peoples crafted this style of finished ware the historical pottery of the pueblo indians  text states that the finished  pottery held a glossy melted appearance which was only used for decoration on the pots it is a common misconception that during the end of the th century the use of plant pigments and finely powdered mineral substances became the preferred technique of painting and slowly caused the extinction of glazed pottery frank and harlow  in reality the nearby inhabitants of santa clara pueblo were still producing the highly burnished black on black pottery since the s therefore lending to the revival of the san ildefonso style of black on black painted pottery the only difference between the two pueblos styles is that in santa clara pots are deeply carved and incised whereas in san ildefonso the pottery is generally not carved and painted with pigments to cause unpolished designs on a polished surface hewett sought a skilled pueblo potter who could recreate this ancient pottery style his intention was to place recreated pots in museums and thus preserve the ancient art form maria martinez was known in the tewa pueblo of san ildefonso new mexico for making the thinnest pots in the least time therefore hewett saw her as the perfect pueblo potter to bring his idea to life challenges and experimentsedit a long process of experimentation and overcoming challenges was required to successfully recreate the blackonblack pottery style to meet maria’s exacting standards as almost all clay found in the hills is not jet black one specific challenge was to figure out a way to make the clay turn the desired color maria discovered from observing the tafoya family of santa clara pueblo who still practiced traditional pottery techniques that smothering the fire surrounding the pottery during the outdoor firing process caused the smoke to be trapped and is deposited into the clay creating various shades of black to gunmetal color  she experimented with the idea that an unfired polished red vessel which was painted with a red slip on top of the polish and then fired in a smudging fire at a relatively cool temperature would result in a deep glossy black background with dull black decoration shards and sheep and horse manure placed around the outside and inside of the outdoor kivastyle adobe oven would give the pot a slicker matte finished appearance after much trial and error maria successfully produced a black ware pot the first pots for a museum were fired around  these pots were undecorated unsigned and of a generally rough quality the earliest record of this pottery was in a july  exhibition held at the new mexico museum of art  encouragementedit embarrassed that she could not create high quality black pots in the style of the ancient pueblo peoples martinez hid her pots away from the world a few years later hewett and his guests visited the little tewa pueblo these guests asked to purchase black ware pottery similar to martinezs pots housed in a museum she was greatly encouraged by this interest and resolutely began trying to perfect the art of black ware pottery her skill advanced with each pot and her art began to cause quite a stir among collectors and developed into a business for the black ware pottery in addition martinez began experimenting with various techniques to produce other shapes and colorful forms of pottery description of black ware potteryedit maria and julian martinez matteonglossy blackware wedding vase ca  collection of the fred jones jr museum of art an olla jar has a slightly flattened rim and a marked angle at the shoulder the one created by maria and julian martinez is decorated on the rims only above the angle of the shoulder with continuous paneled bands light is reflected off of the shiny smooth surface the jet black ceramic product’s finish appears unblemished in any way a band of a lighter black decoration stands out against a solid black matte background the pot “depends on the decorative effect of the manipulation of the surface finish alone” to appear as though the decorations are scratched into the pot’s surface the band wraps directly below the narrow neck of the pot a wideeyed avanyu or horned serpent encircles the pot and slithers inside the band the serpents tongue almost touches the tip of his tail the snakes body movements seem alive a tribute to the appreciation the pueblo peoples have for nature and life the decorations on the pot give the pot a personality and unique individualized look processedit creating black ware pottery is a long process consisting of many steps requiring patience and skill six distinct processes occur before the pot is ready to be sold according to susan peterson in the living tradition of maria martinez these steps include “finding and collecting the clay forming a pot scraping and sanding the pot to remove surface irregularities applying the ironbearing slip and burnishing it to a high sheen with a smooth stone decorating the pot with another slip and firing the pot the first step in creating a pot is gathering the clay the clay is gathered once a year usually in october when it is dry and stored in an old weathered adobe structure where the temperature remains constant when martinez is ready to begin molding the clay to form a pot the right amount of clay is brought into the house a cloth laid upon a table holds a mound of gray pink sand with a fist hole in the center filled with an equal amount of blue sand a smaller hole is made in the blue sand and water is poured into the hole the substances are then all kneaded together picked up within the cloth washed and covered with a towel to prevent moisture from escaping where the clay will sit for a day or two to dry the pukis or the supporting mold a dry or fired clay shape where a round bottom of a new piece may be formed builds the base shape of the pot looking like a pancake after squeezing the clay together with ones fingers a wall is pinched up about an inch high from the pancake base a gourd rib is used in crosscrossing motions to smooth out the wall making it thick and even coiling long tube shapes of clay on the top of the clay wall and then smoothing it out with the gourd increases the pot’s height air holes are patched with extra clay and sealed away with the gourd rib like a patch being sewn on a pair of blue jeans after drying the pot is scraped sanded and polished with stones this is the most time consuming part of the entire process a small round stone should be applied to the side of the pot in a consistent horizontal rhythmic motion rubbing the stone parallel with the side of the pot produces a shiny polished even look creating the polished finish with the stone is called burnishing the pot is finally ready to fire after the secondary slip is applied by painting onto the burnished surface various traditional designs firingedit when firing the pots maria martinez used a firing technique called fire reduction a reduction atmosphere occurs when the amount of available oxygen is reduced the firing was a very long process that would take hours the day of in addition to the months of preparation beforehand she would often receive help from either her husband or her children the firing had to be done early in the morning on a clear calm day when wind would not hinder the process they started by carefully placing all of the pots to be fired in a fire pit and then covered them carefully with broken pieces of pottery and aluminum sheets or any metal scraps they could find in order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning they left small spaces uncovered after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips  very dry cow dung  used to fuel the fire careful to leave the vents free the goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots hence the protective metal sheets after covering the kiln with the cow chips they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat they continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around  to  degrees fahrenheit depending on what look they were attempting if the fire continued to burn the pottery would achieve a redbrown color but in order to make the black pottery that maria was famous for the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung by doing this the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black after several hours they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly after the kiln had cooled enough they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot or waiting until they were cool enough to touch  during the process of firing they didnt know whether the pots would make it or not decorationsedit julian martinez marias husband began attempting to decorate the pots she made although julian did eventually master decorating techniques for maria’s pots the process consisted of many trials and errors to create his designs a slurry of clay and water known as slip is created and applied to the already burnished but yet unfired surface you cannot polish a design into a matte background as the stone is not as precise as a brush is he discovered that after the guaco juice burned out from the heat of the fire he could mix the guaco with clay which then provided the perfect paint for his decorations the process julian settled on was to polish the background first then matte paint the decoration in the negative in  julian finished the first decorated black ware pot with a matte background and a polished avanyu design still achieved by painting the background on an already burnished surface the first rush of water coming down an arroyo after a thunderstorm a symbol of thanksgiving and for water and rain was the interpretation by julian of an avanyu or a horned water serpent many of julian’s decorations were patterns adopted from ancient vessels of the pueblos some of the patterns consisted of birds road runner tracks rain feathers clouds mountains and zigzags or kiva steps the museum displayed the first two decorated black ware pots painted by julian signaturesedit maria signed her creations in different ways throughout her lifetime the signatures found on the bottom of the pottery help date the pieces of art maria and julian’s oldest work were all unsigned the two had no idea that their art would become so popular and did not feel it was a necessity to claim their work the unsigned pieces were most likely made between the years of  and  once maria gained success with her pottery she began signing her work as marie she thought that the name marie was more popular among the nonindian public than the name maria and would influence the purchasers more the pieces signed as marie date the pottery between  and  even though julian decorated the pots only maria claimed the work since pottery was still considered a woman’s job in the pueblo maria left julian’s signature off the pieces to respect the pueblo culture until  after that “marie  julian” remained the official signature on all of the pottery until julian’s death in  lori  maria’s family began helping with the pottery business after julian’s death from  to  maria’s son adam and his wife santana collected clay coiled polished decorated and fired pottery with maria adam took over his father’s job of collecting clay and painting the decorations “marie  santana” became the new signature on the pots for about thirty years maria signed her name as “marie” once her son popovi da began working alongside his mother maria began referring to herself as “maria” on the pottery they began cosigning their pieces around  as “mariapoveka” and “mariapopovi thus studying the signature on one of maria’s pots may give a hint at the completion date of the pottery since dates were not added to the pottery until recent years accomplishmentsedit although black ware pottery received a lot of success the true legend behind the pottery is maria martinez herself she won many awards and presented her pottery at many world fairs and received the initial grant for the national endowment for the arts to fund a martinez pottery workshop in  martinez passed on her knowledge and skill to many others including her family other women in the pueblo and students in the outside world when she was a young girl she had learned how to become a potter by watching her aunt nicolasa make pottery during the time that she developed what we now know as the san ildefonso style of traditional pottery she learned much from sarafina tafoya the pottery matriarch of neighboring santa clara pueblo see alsoedit cueva de la

ildefonso pueblo is a quiet community located  miles northwest of santa fe new mexico maria antonia montoya was born there probably in the year  for nearly one hundred years until her death in  maria lived in the pueblo eager to greet visitors and to share her craft with those who would like to watch and listen marias fascination with pottery making started at a young age when she would watch her aunt making pots after her chores were done although many women in the pueblo knew how to make pottery by marias time it was no longer a necessary part of daily life inexpensive spanish tin ware and anglo enamelware had replaced traditional containers and cooking pots in many ways the art of pottery making was facing extinction fortunately marias interest and willingness to experiment with techniques prevented this from occurring not long after her marriage to julian martinez maria was asked to replicate some prehistoric pottery styles that had been discovered in an archaeological excavation of an ancient pueblo site near san ildefonso these excavations of  and  led by dr edgar lee hewett who was also the director of the museum of new mexico produced examples of many prehistoric pottery techniques dr hewett asked maria who already had a reputation in the pueblo for being an excellent potterymaker if she could make fullscale examples for the museum of the polychrome ware it was then that maria and her husband julian who painted the designs on the pottery after maria shaped them began an artistic collaboration that would last throughout their lives together maria and julian refined their pottery techniques and were asked to demonstrate their craft at several expositions including the  st louis worlds fair the  panamacalifornia exposition in san diego and the  chicago worlds fair part of their success came from their innovations in the style of blackonblack ware although other pueblos such as santa clara had been producing black wares maria and julian invented a technique that would allow for areas of the pottery to have a matte finish and other areas to be a glossy jet black through experimentation that began in  they created a style that would become world famous part of the uniqueness of san ildefonso pottery is the clay that is used which comes from their reservation dried clay and volcanic ash are collected yearly from selected locations throughout the reservation and later combined with water in small batches the clay from each pueblo has its own mineral composition allowing for rich differences in texture and color the watery clay slip that is used on the black wares for example has a rich iron content that turns black when fired in a particular way after a batch of clay is mixed and has set for a few days a pancake of clay is formed and pressed into a puki beginning the process of building a pot the puki is a bowlshaped form that supports the bottom of the pot as it is being built most commonly pots are formed with a coil technique in which long snakeshaped coils are circled around the base of the pot and blended together to create the walls of the vessel less details dimensions ʺw × ʺd × ʺh
