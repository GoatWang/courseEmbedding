sheraton vistana resort lately reviews by angela updated nov   the courts are newly renovated edited  our group of  stayed in two units in the courts the layout is so spacious and this section was quiet yet close to everything you could want it is an easy walking distance to the grocery store zimmies restaurant the karaoke pool putt putt rec center we were looking for a particular item at the grocery store and they didnt have exactly what we needed but we told them that if we just had a cheese grater we could work it out with what they had the guest service person was standing at our door with a cheese grater when we got back to our unit great service  the staff was wonderful everywhere we went in the resort you could have a great vacation without leaving the resort this is one of the older units the courts which means it is much more spacious than the newer ones units are in great shape by patriciam dec   this place is fantastic all other resorts we visited are compared to the vistana in accommodations facilities activities and cleanliness we walk to downtown disney every morning for our coffee and exercise so much to do we go every year and sometimes dont even visit the parks the vistana is a destination in itself highly recommend making it a family tradition our extended family has been going every year for over thirty years by joseph dec   this resort is the best ive been to by far ive visited a lot of timeshares but they all pale beside this by sharonh jul   we loved this resort we stayed in the cascades section overlooking the pool in a  bd  bath villa it was very new looking and quite high end we were so pleasantly surprised with all the different pools we had a different choice almost every day the giant water slide was a great favorite of my kids all the staff except the timeshare selling staff were courteuous and quick to respond as needed the timeshare staff was pushy snobbish and would not take no for an answer by mariae updated mar   beautiful place we had an amazing suite for  great pools very near disney and h studios and many other attractions make sure you have a gps to get around this place had such friendly workers make sure to tip the cleaning staff they work their buts off and deserve a very good tip enjoy its such a beautiful and well kept resort my then  yr old loved swimming past pm it was his dream come true the smile on childrens faces from around the world was heartwarming i would love to visit again however only on the renovated side so make sure thats where youll be at by cyndiv dec   this is a fabulous resort we had a  bedroom unit it was beautifully furnished and maintained the kitchen was well stocked and the beds were comfortable the grounds are beautiful and the pool was great the market store on the resort was well stocked and the prices were reasonable the resort restaurant was good however i suggest skipping the sales pitch they are very aggressive and do not take no for an answer i simply wanted printed information about prices etc to take home and they would not give it just received a very unprofessional high pressure sale by garyt dec   great location very close to  entrances to disney world yet also has a nice proximity to sea world and the airportthe staff is very kind and do not hound you to buy a new timeshare if you simply tell them that you are not interested in taking the tour or the owners updatethe rooms have all been remodeled and are in great condition and very clean by melissab jul   they had originally put us in palms which was not renovated and still looked like a late s unit broken thermostat many bugs dirty  smelled like mold we complained and the manager we spoke to was extremely pleasant and changed our room however we lost about a day and a half waiting to move to another room so we felt displaced for a bit the new reno room was in the falls and made up big time for the palms overall loved it otherwise by nancianns may   be careful not to get the older partthey shouldnt even rent this out to anyone bugs everywhere and dirty the newer part is nice but lost a whole day and a half trying to switch rooms be careful by davidd apr   my wife and i went over to spend some time at one of our unit weeks in the courts unit k is one of the units with a nd bedroom and loft upstairs it was still in beautiful shape for its age no spell and nothing broken this unit will be undergoing rennovation in the last phase early next year  of my other four units have now been refrubished and they are as the ratings describe i cant wait for the work on my courts units to be complete i often rent out my units now that i live in florida however i still love to go over to enjoy the amenities and to play volleyball with the grandkids we enjoyed some exceptional games in the sand and the water the food we had at zimmis was excellent but i still miss the discount coupons loved the sauna and the not tubs just walking the grounds every day relaxed me in a way no other resort does i love to travel but havent found another resort that compares to vistan for family fun try the saturday night sing along at zimmies and you will be surprised at the talent by lauraa updated feb   we had a refurbished unit in the fountains section and it was wonderful the only drawbacks were  they charged us for a rollaway bed which we didnt have hopefully well get a credit back to our card  i would have liked a better cutting board and some place mats and potholders and  the pool was too cold for me in all other respects it was fantastic we didnt attend a sales presentation by peter updated nov   we stayed in the cascades section from march     we had a great time we stayed in a  bedroom   bath unit on the nd floor used the stairs mostly i believe all the renovations in this building are now complete as of nov  the view from our balcony was very relaxing you could watch the fountain spraying water  feet in the air in the middle of the lake or watch the ducks and ducklings move about on the water having breakfast on the balcony and watching the sun rise was very peaceful we did a tour of recently renovated units in various sections and they look terrific pools were great workout areas were fine usually not crowded in the evening the main restaurant was ok happy hour prices at the main large pool were the best the take out restaurants were excellent when we wanted something quick it could be delivered or picked up which we did as it was no effort at all the people we dealt with at the resort were very friendly we bought discount disney tickets and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here once all the renovations are done to all the sections of this resort it will be even more outstanding by donnak nov   weve owned in the lake section for many years now but mostly exchange it for other locations wed like to visit this year we let our daughters and their friends use our unit i saw the pictures they brought home and it was beautiful they felt the pools were well maintained the place was clean and the staff was nice and helpful a month later my husband and i went using banked time and it was a pleasant experience not having seen the resort in many years my advice would be to try to avoid the lure of free stuff to listen to their sales pitch we went to the villages for our presentation the woman we got was extremely rude and pushy where do they find these people we used the place not as a vacation but to look for a vacation home to buy we put an offer on a home while we were there making buying another unit out of the question but we still had to attend the presentation when i made it clear i wasnt buying anything due to our changed finances she made us stay the longest she could just for spite i actually cried out of frustration by johno updated nov   our recent vacation at the sheraton vistana was september october  we had purchased an even and odd year week at the cascades section earlier this year and were very anxious to see what we had bought unlike the previous poster we were aware that the every unit at the sheraton vistana was being completely refurbished knowing this we asked for a unit that had already been refurbished although we could not use our unit at the cascades section due to the remodeling we were given a completely updated one in the falls section the refurbishment of these units was not just a minor upgradethe units were completely gutted everything inside down to the studs you would have to see the results for yourself to truly appreciate the finished product every unit has a full kitchen with new appliances granite counter tops can be found in the kitchen and both bathrooms all furniture is brand new and the beds are very comfortable the refurbishment for all units is to be completed in mid  the finished units are beautiful and truly worthy of a  star rating the landscaping is a work of art many large ponds are on the property and add to beauty of this resort seven huge pools are available for use throughout the property planned activities are also available my wife took part in an astronomy session and loved viewing the moon and nearest planets on two high powered telescopes the grand daughter was also thrilled with a dance class she attended the staff at the sheraton vistana should be commended for their friendly manner and willingness to help we had two minor problems at our unit while we were there and cheerful service people responded within  minutes on both occasions my wife and i thought so much of this property that upon our return home we purchased an annual unit in the springs section this was not purchased through sheraton vistanas starwood network but through another internet site although we do not get to enjoy the starwoods inter network property trades the price was much much cheaper a word of caution heremake sure the unit you are buying has no refurbishment fees which could run as high as  and if you are trading for a week at the sheraton vistana insist on a refurbished unit i would also pass up the  for the sales pitch breakfast not particularly high pressure but not worth the time if you take this advice i am sure you will fall in love with this property just as fast as the wife and i did by angelg jul   my family and i stayed here from july   to july   we will not stay here again the rooms were very outdated and several things were stained badly or broken the faucet was broken the fold out sofas were worn out the bed stood about a foot off of the ground which needless to say the mattresses were worn out and thin the television buttons were broken housekeeping came by once and she gave us fresh towells and made our bed once in seven days the dishwasher was missing some buttons the whole resort was just dirty the sales rep that we met with about purchasing a timeshare on the second day of our visit was forceful and pushy as well as rude he told us we had only two hours to make up our minds about purchasing a timeshare with them or the rates would double i told him as a christian family we needed to pray about it and sleep over night and he short of mocked us and held out his hands and said pray now and when we told him that we wouldnt consider making that kind of purchase without deep prayer and a nights rest he threw his hands up in the air and began to shove his paper work in his desk saying oh well then there is nothing i can do for you what a jerk needless to say we spent as little time as possible there we went to their  very chlorinated and hazy pools just twice hoping for a different outcome the second time i will say however the people who checked us in could speak english and also the man who sold us our disney tickets however you might have a difficult time understanding some of the others by tim updated apr   just stayed at this property week before easter  traded in through rci they always put you in the outdated rooms near the main road which tend to be very noisy tried to get into a newer unit but was impossible in addition to my recent rci stay a few months earlier i bought a resale here i looked at the units which have been updated which will be the case for the whole property by the end of  the new units are absolutely stunning staying in an old outdated unit though was very depressing this is a question to ask when renting or buying here you also have to pay  for reno charges for two years if you buy in now which is for the updatesreno of the units i am happy to buy at this property with the updates in mind down the road for my future visits i have stayed at a few resorts now in the orlando area and find the facilities on this property very nice you hardly have time to use many of the different facilities when combining all the theme park visits it has an outstanding kids pool with water spraying up all over the pool which keeps toddlers quite amused this part of the pool in only about a foot deep but you do have to watch the little ones since one side leads to about two to three feet of depth still the littles ones spend hours here since it is such a large pool area for toddlers one of the best i have seen i would compare this to the best i have seen great price for drinks at the bar at happy hour you do pay for everything on this property eg  per person to shuttle to disney and the other parks also quite a walk to get from most units to the pools in most cases since there are two thousand units here property is beautiful and well maintained can take ten minutes to get a person on the phone when you need to ask a question or if you leave a message no calls are returned beware when they say two hours for the timeshare presentation these are real pros when it comes to selling nothing is free you will spend more time there and it is hard saying no to them since they are real selllerssharks to get you to buy or upgrade or beware of the explorer program total ripoff  or so for  spg points plus four nights at another resort in north carolina  spg points only gets you three nights at a category  eg westin they also give you a  off rack rate at any spg hotel that works out to similar prices of the spg promotional prices on their website or other sites like expedia so beware of the explorer angle i went in to the presentation having just bought a resale and they said it is only an hour to update on what the resort has  for this updateright it actually turned into three hours of vacation time the explorer adds an hour since they tell you they are not selling you the timeshare at that point what a dis service to the spg brand i feel like switching everything over to another hotel chain when i travel on business now after this ordeal they are good so be warned that  or another bonus for free is really not worth your time i have to admit staying in the palms unit by the road really upset me so make sure you understand where your unit is this will be updated in  sometime from what they told me the outdated units were fine considering it was an exchange that didnt cost me much at all but it was still not the level you would expect from sheraton quite depressing colors and decor but huge rooms and clean enough read the reviews thats all i can recommend and you will get a better idea of what many people think i am sure once this resort is all updated it will be a great place to stay by chriskre dec   wow i thoroughly enjoyed our trip to disney this time we went during food and wine festival in november and decided to stay at this resort instead of onsite despite the fact that im a dvc member i was able to pick up a week on an rci last call well when we first checked in like most people who got stuck with the older units we werent particularly impressed but not that unhappy either the only problem was that after the first night it seemed that the unit had bed bugs so the staff was gracious enough to move us to a brand new unit so here is the wow factor granite counter tops tumbled marble in the baths a nice jacuzzi in the master  plasma giant screen tvs and even a bose stereo system everything was bolted down understandably but it was so nice to stay in this modern new york loft style condo that we were sad when the week was over the kitchen is amazing real wooden cabinets and granite counter tops all new appliances we actually made omlettes and pancakes it was so inviting our unit had a nice balcony overlooking a tranquil lake with a fountain i have no complaints about our improved unit and the staff was very friendly the timeshare pitch was a bit of a scam because we were told we could get  off all our tickets to the parks but it was only off certain tickets like the  day passes not the one day passes so we ended up buying  day passes for florida residents cheaper stay here you will like it its real close to lake buena vista by lauraa updated nov   we just returned from  weeks at the sheraton vistana  and wow we went with rci and requested a stayover in the same room for our  week stay and were put in a renovated unit in the fountains and it was amazing we had a ground floor unit that opened up to a playground and the beautiful pool area  perfect for our kids the only concern was that the washerdryer are small and therefore had to do a load of laundry each night and they were noisy and located between the  bedrooms i was concerned about staying here after reading many reviews but once all units are renovated this will be an amazing vacation spot for anyone to enjoy we do recommend a car rental even though the resort is within  minutes of disney you have to see other attractions in the area such as universal gatorland fun spot and of course kennedy space centre many great restaurants in the area but especially recommend bahama breeze and landrys seafood  excellent by judyl nov   we just returned from our week long stay at sheraton vistana we have owned since  we usually try to go back to vistana every year we love the atmosphere at vistana we have found our favorite unit that overlooks a beautiful pool scene we ask for that unit each time and have been successful at getting the unit requested the only thing about requesting a certain unit is that you may have to wait to checkin we prefer an early checkin we own  timeshares and this one is our favorite i would recommend it to anyone all the units are getting updated either this year or next year by the end of  they all should be in top condition by bonniea updated jul   i have just returned home from this resort and i do have to say our room in the lakes section was gorgeous they have just been completely redone and they make the cascades sections of this resort look totally run down i am also a cascades owner and have just been informed that they are going to be refurbishing them once the other areas of the resort have been done fountains i ii springs and falls the courts section is also going to be done in  by then this resort will be a gold star resort and every part of it except palms will be brand new and no one will have a reason to complain about the villas in previous readings it has been said that some amenities you have to pay for well many resorts that offer what this one does you will have a  expensive to pay for your fun if you dont like the golfingminu putt then dont golf if you have ever been to orange lake you have to pay for everything there its all in the holiday fun package of family travel this resort is so central to everything restaurants prime outlet mall disney  grocery store pharmace and liquor store right next door it has several restaurants some with pool side service and some without if you want drinks or food at one of the pools then go to the one that offers it personally we love the fountains pool its quiet and not hardly any kids especially when our children are teenagers and they dont want to be around alot of noise the cascades pool is full of children so if you want kids then thats the pool to go to i am an owner of  timeshares and have stayed at many in orlando and for what you get and location you will not find a better resort the pools are open until  am all hiltons close at  so that doesnt work for our family also it does not offer more than a few simple activities and its really no fun for teenagers as nothing to do there we love the sheraton resort and go there  times per year and now our oldest goes on her own  so do your homework before you travel and check out the websites as its unfair to complain about anything when you have the option of knowing about it before you go its funny people will spend hundreds of dollars on disney parks and food there but when it comes to a  golf mini putt game its like its a million dollars to golf so enjoy this resort to the fullest and forget about the small extras that go with it its all in the memory of a great vacationso if you want to pick the nicest areas now it goes like this lakesgorgeousfountains i beautiful no mb whirlpoolfountains ii gorgeous whirlpool in mb springs and falls are next by the end of  then cascades and courts  so instead of asking for cascades try the others you will be happy with  digital tvs while eating breakfast at the marble top counter sitting on bar stools listening to the bose stereo sytem you will truly love it  i guarantee you wont stay in cascades again once you have been in these new units by aprilb updated may   we own two units in the lakes and falls section of this resort one july th week and one columbus day week we love it here less than a mile from disney entrance we can sit on our balcony and watch the fireworks nightly at disney our units are two bedroom two full bathroom spacious beautifully decorated  sq ft units that sleep  comfortably trading power for these units are incredible we have traded to ski at beavercreek in colorado and tahoe and scuba dive in maui cancun and cozumel the renovations are spectacular and we cant wait to go back there this july th the staff is awesome and always ready to help with any need you may have the pools are beautiful and with teenage children they stay busy all day at the resort we love it here by deb mar   just stayed at the vistana i rented a week from an owner asked for the cascades a month in advance as the paperwrk suggested it was an ok stay the unit was outdated but clean was first assigned to a really old unit in the courts but the cleaning solution smell was so strong we had to leave the staff at the desk was very accomodating and asked us to look at another unit that unit was ok but was a total mess hadnt been cleaned yet finally settled into the third unit that was in the fountains ii section the outside stairs up to the unit could use a simple powerwashing the unit itself was clean just outdated freshly painted and wallpapered large in size shaded location relatively quiet convenient parking got maid service midweek plus a supervisor follow up to make sure we were happy the service was friendly just a call every day to invite us to a free breakfast where they try to sell you a unit the heater in the fountains pool was broken got a nice voice mail saying it would be fixed after we left used other pools which where nice but only certain pools have towels available no poolside drink service the small mini golf course was not worth the  charge per personit should be free since it was completely boring overall i would have preferred the cascades newer models and pools i recommend being assertive and not taking a really old unit by jimm feb   vistana is the greatest i have owned a vista in vistana for over  years you cannot go wrong with any of the facilities the older units courts and fallsare actually more private than the newer units these are only two story resorts and much better parking facilities the entire resort is open to everyone we swim at every pool visit all parts of the complex and enjoy it immensely i have visited many other timeshares from coast to coast the service levels at vistana are the best the atmosphere is very family oriented no pressure sales pitch if you choose excellent accommodations for young and old alike it always been rated as a gold crown unit and always will it sure doesnt hurt that it sits besides the happiest place on earth disney epcot universal city walk seaworld daytona nasa are all within easy reach enjoy your stayill say hi to you and welcome you when i see you at vistana by marilynr feb   i have owned in the courts for more than  years they have been updated recently and the units are larger than the newer ones the staff is very friendly and versatile there are so many activities that we dont see the older children until late in the evening there are many many attractions nearby that all ages thoroughly enjoy i highly recommend this resort by minnied updated jan   we have owned here at vistana since  and use it every year we have taken all of our children down along with their friends now we enjoy it wour grandchildren and their friends along wfamily if there is ever a problem they fix it almost immediately i highly recomend this resort they keep up wthe units and the grounds they are immaculate it is very close to disney shopping etc it is also a gated community and you dont have to worry about the children they have something going for everyone every day if you want you do not have to go into to the parks to enjoy yourself try ityou will like it desanto by jeromer aug   we have just returned from a week at the sheraton vistana resort  the hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before it was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go to the theme parks at all in fact we didnt bother with disney  having been before and just did a few trips to universal it was so hot and busy there we couldnt wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotelwe stayed in a  bed room they must have redone them as of late they were like new flat screen tv and dvds wow what a nice place to stay the pools are lovely and big our kids are  and  and they enjoyed it the pool attendants were wonderful overall i would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and i am extremely fussy perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is theme parks but if you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to the parks then this is an absolute must psrestaurants are great by teresap aug   my husband myself and another couple along with their daughter stayed the week of july th  august rd we stayed in the cascades area which i was thankful for after walking around and seeing how old looking that the other areas were but you could start seeing the wear and tear even in the cascades but overall it was ok that was the good side my husband and i have stayed at other resorts and have never had to pay for the amenities here you have to pay for everything that you want to do except swim if you are an owner you have to pay  each to play miniature golf in a really tired looking course your money is much better spent somewhere else that is not even the worst of it all week we had someone above us that was up all night yelling running and just being rude we called security every night for the week that we were there nothing stopped we even would call during the day and were told that management would get back with us and no one ever did the last night we were there i called it did not stop i called an hour later and this person put me through to security and they said that the first person never contacted them so it makes me wonder if they had ever been contacted the other times that week my husband and the other gentleman that we were with had  hours of sleep before making a   hour drive home all we got was a sorry and our exchange fee back i would never stay here again while the grounds are nice there are much nicer places to stay that will take care of their guests by dann jul   stayed here the last week of june great resort kids loved the pools staff was very helpful very quiet and peaceful room was very clean everything was very close and easy to get to if you are coming to orlando this is a great place to stay by tasse jul   this is a hidden gem the location is central convenient to everything i  international drive outlet malls disney etc the resort is clean family oriented everything you could want is in the resort great variety of pools rec centres restaurants tennis mini golf etc we have stayed here the last two years march   feb  and have been totally pleased with the service and aminities by mariam mar   we had a mini family reunion in orlando and rented  units in the cascades section at sheraton vistana resort we had a total of  children ages    in tow i was a little concerned because of some of the previous reviews i read but decided to go anyway we were very pleasantly surprised check in was a breeze a very nice young man walked us to our unitsall in same building across from the pool and made sure we were satisfied the units were spacious clean and nicely furnished the pool was spectacular and we had a hard time getting the little ones out of the kiddie pool section which was huge the location of this property in relation to disney was a big pluswe were only a  minute drive to disney and there was plenty of shopping and restaurants in the vicinity the staff was extremely polite and eager to please as a result we are now looking to buy a resale in the cascades section of the vistana resort by timothy updated jan   i had  units week before xmas  resort is great very well maintained units very clean and not run down anyone who reads this must know this all  partys we traveled with called before we went down there to verify a shuddel service to get to the parks and was told yes but when we got there is was only for hotel guest forgot to tell us that part i thought if you offer it and was going there anyway who cares where you are on the property also when we called up front for a taxi to goto downtown disney they told us in  min we waited a hour and no show so we complainted to the front desk and they kept hanging up on us as soon as they knew it was us calling again to find out where out taxi was staff a little pushy on check in for there free breakfastsell you a unit breakfast kept calling room and leaving messages other than those small issues everything was great if returning to florida again withfamily would go back to this resort one great thing is a few of the pools are open to  am pools and pool area very clean they use alot of clorine so if this bothers you dont get in travel times disney is very close you can get to almost all disney parks within  min universal is about  min away also close to kissimmee under  min away by jerry updated jan   dec  weeks before and after christmas in  different  bedroom bath condos the resort is very beautifulmany gorgeous heated pools hot tubs exercise rooms and many activities especially for children first week was in the fountains first floor just in front of a huge pool we asked for first floor because there are no elevators in the older sectionsjust in the cascades and the lakes starwood owned some of the buildings have three floors and we dont do stairs well the condo was clean and well decorated jacuzzi in master bath with separate walk in shower the bed was hard and the sofa and overstuffed chair in the living room were broken down so that you sank to the bottom when you sat the kitchen had adequate dishes to eat out of but was very sparse on cooking utensils and no mid size microwavable bowls second week was first floor in the falls redecorated clean and pretty with a good mattress and comfortable sofa and chair in living room the kitchen utensils were even sparserhad to cook veggies for two in a spaghetti for  size pot master bath had a nice dressing area with lav but shower was inside the jacuzzi with sliding doors which made it difficult to access we are in our seventies and the shower in second bath was also inside the regular size tubno problem getting in and out of this the two newer sections of the resortcascades and lakes are the only two owned by starwood and they are realy nice we were supposed to get the cascades the first week but were told not enough owners turned in their weeks for us to get there the fountains falls and other sectiions of the resort are owed and operated by owners associations this explains the disparities mentioned here in various ratings we took the tour and were not pressured at all we already own enough resort points so we declined i would rate the resort a four star and i am sure the starwood parts are five star by jeff oct   we stayed in the cascades section of vistana and couldnt have been happier it was very spacious clean and a perfect location for both disney and mgm we visited all the areas of the resort and liked the lakes section as well i see that many who stayed in the older sections of the resort werent as happy if you have a choice ask for cascades or lakes i have teenagers so i was a little worried they would be bored when they werent in the parks there was so much to do they were happy to have  days in the resort i would definately go again by roxanne sep   visited  and was given a bd sleeps  in the falls section i was informed by the front desk that the room was recently refurbished well here goes  the bad the sheets had stains the blankets had holes no kidding and i told my kids not to use the comforters only god knows the doors on the showers were broken and the shower heads were coming off the walls in both bathrooms i washed the linens prior to using and the stains did not come off in the kitchen there were  dishes a few bowls  frying pan  pot  baking dish  ash trays  you get the picture here the room was clean but quite dated with pink walls and heavy heavy floral drapes not curtains on wednesday we were given a complementary cleaning ok the kitchen floors appeared clean but were sticky and the stained sheets were still on the bed nuff said i attended their timeshare and they tried to sell me a  bed in the new vistana villages for k however since i was staying in the sheraton vistana i was not allowed to use the new clean pools at the vistana villages i also found out that rci is considered rd class on the sheraton vistana list of guests i was told x in one week by the staff we did not use the facilities on the property  thank god the weather was working on our side i would not return went to orange lake country club to enjoy their facilities by wesd updated aug   i exchanged from a gold crown  week in cyprus which is highest demand by rci standards to a  year old  bedroom apartment in the courts area of the resort the resort itself was all i could ask for but the standard of accommodation i was given was a big disappointment i also feel the way the manager promised me an upgrade at my expense then never got back in touch was lousy customer service on top of that the pressure as soon as you check in to go to a presentation on starwood vacations was terrible i told the gentleman that i was not interested in another timeshare but i had to walk away from the representative as he could not take no for an answer if you are exchanging like i did ensure through your exchange company you get accommodation in the cascades or the falls not in the courts or you will be hugely disappointed by imhappy updated apr   we love this resort we visit orlando evey year for the month of april and have visited lots of rci resorts this by far is one of the nicest ones we have been to the activites staff  lacking clear english are wonderful with the kids they are very friendly and my kids loved them we stayed in one of the older units the springs other than the mauve tile in the master bathroom it was all updated the master bed was sooooooo comfortable the unit itself is a little smaller than most two bedrooms we have stayed at but still large enough i liked how the second bedroom and the living room are far enough away from the master bedroom if you can stay here jump at the chance they have so much to do for kids of all ages our clan ranged from  enjoy hope you have as much fun as we did cant wait to return next year by raymondm apr   hey this is by far the choice place to stay for anyone who wants it all i own there for over  yrs and have had great exchange powers because of its location and of its gold crown rating i have been given bdrms in kaui on a golf course with a wraparound deck for my week i have even been offered  and  weeks at other places for my week they simply dont come any better by stasiar jan   my husband  yr old son and i just returned from our  day stay in the fountains section of the resort this is an older section of the resort the furnishings are not quite as plush as the cascades section which is the new section that starwood actually built the other sections are the ones that starwood acquired and it is quite obvious some of the other older sections looked quite dumpy we were in a  br unit very spacious had everything you could possibly want downside of the fountains section is that it is right next to the highway so there is a lot of highway noise i think they have the fountains to mask the noise we were there on a free stay for a timeshare sale of the vistana villages they were not pushy at all after touring the vistana villages it made this place look like a dump we thought that going to disney in january would be less busy boy were we wrong it was freezing and tons of people and traffic i dont think there is a good time to visit disney anymore by patricemoore updated dec   upon checking in we waited in line while two employees at the desk checked guests in and out we waited about twenty minutes which was not bad considering how well they do explaining everything about the resortwhat upset me was across from the check in desk was the starwood timeshare sales desk with  employees trying to sell you a timeshareso now i know where the focus is the room was in the fountain section which is older was just ok the bathrooms were dirty and the master bed had no sheetswhat was completely disgusting was our blanket with black hair all over it and a stain of feces on it we called the front desk and told them our problem they said they would send someone up as soon as possible although they were very busy again back to the  behind the sales desk and two helping the guests we had to call again two hours later and finally they showed up we never heard from a manager or received any kind of apology until we went on the timeshare tour and told them overall the property is gorgeous the pools are great and the activities staff were excellentwe never complain nor do i ever take the time to write reviews needless to say we will not return by lawless updated sep   i recently spent a week at the vistana at the end of august my family and i had a great time we stayed in the palms section this time around its an older unit but still had all the amentities of the newer sections and talk about spacious its the most relaxed ive ever been on vacation i loved it so much that i just purchased a br in the fountains section i look forward to spending vacations at this resort by pat sep   we own week  and  and love this resort our unit in the fountains has just been renovated they are working their way through the whole resort and is beautiful any problems we may have had in the unit had been promptly fixed the pool was a little crowded but it was easter week and when we go other times it isnt bad the kidsteens love it because there is lots to do and lots of other kids their age there great family vacation they even turned down disney a couple of days so they could stay back and enjoy the activities and pool which was fine with me i had margaritas at poolside by carlos updated jul   just returned from the th of july week at the sheraton vistanacascades we rented a time share unit and were very satisfied with the resort the br villa was more than adequate had everything we needed washerdryerironing board and iron hair dryersfull kitchen w all utensils spacious and seemed very new everything worked fine no problems resort is very nice safe and the staff is friendly many pools to enjoy however very tired after disney parks very close to disney parksrestaurants malls etc cant wait to return by teresa may   our th year at vistana just spent two weeks in the lakes section st floor unit near both the lakes pool and the fountains pool what a great time we had our three children had tons to do on property and of course the resort is close to all the major attractions absolutely gorgous grounds mature trees and lanscaping everywhere although vistana is a fairly large property it still feels very intimate we have stayed at other top notch resorts and vistana is our favorite by far by alfredn apr   as an owner since my family has never had an unsatisfying vacation at vistanathe grounds  acres of pondsfoliageetcalone make this resort an oasis their  swimming poolsand  recreation rooms guarantee that family  friends will never be bored from sun up to after darkthis resort is a paradise for vacationers of all ages by d apr   the best thing about this resort is its location without having to get on a major roadway you can be in disney that said we just finished a week in a cascades unit during that week it took  hours to resolve an electronic door lock malfunction our diswasher leaked our washing machine stopped running and the toilet backed up luckily we spent most of our time out of the unit this was especially true since the few times we wanted to go to the pool the deck was completely full if you are looking for a convenient place to park while visiting disney this will work but if you hope to enjoy the facilities id suggest looking somewhere else by greg mar   we stayed in the springs section last summer while not as new as the cascades section they are directly next to them and in great condition the springs has a great location since they are very close to the large cascades pool but also have their own recreation center and pool our topfloor  br unit in the springs was large and very nice vaulted ceilings a huge back screenedin porch and full kitchen with everything you could possibly want each unit in the springs also has a back entrance from the porch which adds to the spacious feel given the amenities of the resort and the location of the vistana i dont think you will find a better offproperty resort when planning a waltdisneyworld vacation by carl feb   truly a beautiful resort with all the bells  whistles kids too will enjoy this place only minutes to drive to all the big attractions try it you will love it by ssspeak feb   our extended family just stayed in two units each sleeping eight the week between christmas and new years the units were extremely comfortable and we had plenty of room to spread out which was important since we had five young children with us it was only a short drive to the wdw parks and there were grocery stores and restaurants very close by one thing i want to caution about  dont even think about trying to stay at the resort without a car they do offer minimal transportation to and from the parks but only a few times a day and it would be very difficult to try to adhere to their transportation schedule you really need your own car if you are planning to go to the parks i cannot emphasize enough however how comfortable the units were without going into detail lets just say youll be very happy by pam jan   we just came back from a great week at the cascades great pool wonderful location that is close to everything we were very very pleased we plan on returning in march by robert jan   my family and i stayed at the vistana resort in may of  we are owners at the vistana village and decided to give the resort a try we were very pleased with the resort accomodations and found the service to be fine with the exception of housekeeping the resort has many more amenities than the vistana village has to offer and with the many separate sections we tried a different pool almost daily the location was certainly very convenient to disney which we enjoyed immensely as to whether i would return there we just booked another vacation in march to the resort in hopes of finding warm weather and an opportunity to catch a yankee preseason game by susan nov   we own  wks at the svr and stayed the last two weeks of aug plenty of room for the  of uskids from ages  to  something to do for all within miles of disney parks close to everything pools are great especially the super pool our unit in the fountains section was very clean and kept upno disappointments here great family resort with friendly courteous employees we really loved going on the casino cruise by suedurrant aug   wow the vistana is a wonderful place to stay as a single parent i felt very safe at the vistana with plenty of security and wonderful amenitites for the children we stayed on the fountains area of the resort with the pool at the end of the road our wonderful  bed villa was spacious clean and very well appointed it felt very much like home the divein movies at the pool were a great hit with the kids the staff at the sheraton were wonderful and although we had only a small problem with our vcr they were there in  mins to collect it and replace it what service as a brit i am thoroughly impressed with the vistana and cannot wait to return there next year for me there is no where else in orlando that i would stay by sender jul   we love it here the pools are plentiful beautiful grounds and the best location so close to both disney and the universal parks our unit was nice and roomy with  tvs for the kids we also had a beautiful view of the lake and fountains staff very friendly and nice overall this is the place for us when we come down to orlando by irenelf jun   we stayed here twice in summer  for two weeks and again in fall  i loved everything about this resort for our first stay we were in an older  br unit along the lagoons and loved the location so much that i requested it again when we returned in  i much prefer a ground floor location with easy access to the street or paths along the lagoons than to be in a high rise we had ducks at our back door which the kids enjoyed a lot and were able to walk along the lagoons and see herons and other water birds very close up the resort does have everything you could want including a store for food sundries souvenirs and also has a couple of restaurants and a pizza hut on premises one would not have to leave the complex if you didnt want to as everything could be found there the location is a great one for the parks as well as downtown disney its also a quick hop to crossroads shopping center which has some good restaurants a supermarket and ice cream store as well as other shops the unit itself was well maintained decorated very nicely is huge and very comfortable it was well stocked with everything we could need and is a place i would love to return to the next time we go to wdw there are many pools to choose from each with its own specialty ie some type of slide or just a big super pool etc and the kids enjoyed a down day at the resort just trying all the pools we did not take advantage of most of the resorts many amenities because we were there primarily for the parks the unit and the resort looked as great in  as it did in  its a big resort quite sprawling but it is easy enough to walk among various pools if you are in the right area i loved the vistana by regina may   the management co and its employees here were very friendly and playful the snackbar serves very good food the rooms and pools are very clean and well maintained by janicele updated apr   we just returned from renting at the vistana springs for a week it was fabulous close to the parks we rented a car but there is so much to do at the resort you can simply stay there all week long if desired going to the different pools for a change of scenery was great the unit we rented was on the older side and could have used an update but it was clean and was plentiful with amenities i would rent here again in a minute we did agree to attend the timesharing presentation for a great discount on park tickets and i had read they could be a bit pushy we made it clear that we werent interested after an hour and walked away still getting the discount i am wondering if our room would have be inundated with calls asking us to attend the sales pitch had we not agreed to it by mochamom apr   we stayed here with our  kids in march of  the complex itself is very nice but our unit was very old it really needed to be updated the beds were old and all the decorations were too we were on the main level in a fountains unit the pool is great food at the resturant was okay we stayed at the marriott last year and it was much nicer than this by tommymac apr   wasnt terribly impressed its a nice facility but it shows its age the shower door woud not close there were basic cooking items missing from the room no room amenities other than small soaps no shampoo ect the cascades has a nice pool but for those with toddlers  be warned that at least when i was there there are no bouys separating the toddler part of the pool from the dropoff to  feet of water we found out the hard way its a great location close to the parks and is chockfull of activites for the kids all day every day but they are scattered all over this enormous resort so be prepared to either drop off your kids with radios or let them walk with radios the other issue i was was with security i had oodles of stuff in my dash parkig passes from the parks ect all week long  covering my vistana parking pass yet only once was i stopped and verified by security normally this is no big deal but with having my kids needing to travel to the other side of the resort sometimes in the dark id like to know that only verified guests are there other than that i gave it  stars because overall the resort shows its age by marguerite mar   stayed at the fountains lovely spacious clean units wonderful staff lots to do great location maggie by starburst updated dec   our biggest complaint is the size of the guest bedroom  twin beds with barely enough room to maneuver around them the master bedroom was large  beautiful however both bathrooms were plain  the first resort that did not furnish basic shampoo conditioner or shower cap the screenedin porch with an exit door to the walkway around the lake with several connecting bridges to cross the lake was the most impressive item on our visit we were also displeased with the number of calls to take a tour even though we precisely informed marketing at checkin that our week was too compressed with medical treatments and family visits in orlando by scooneyotm aug   we stayed in the fountains units lovely great things to do for the whole family had a wonderful time and think it is a fantastic resort the staff were friendly and helpful christine from st maarten by whatsline aug   absolutely the best great staff great resort lots to do and you dont even have to leave the resort if you dont want to totally relaxing by magarian aug   we just completed a week stay mid august  in a two bedroom lakes unit in the back of the resort complex we overlooked a small lake very pretty and in the distance the marriott we are very impressed with the unit itself it was clean spaceous comfortable for  with an inroom safe the master bedroom was huge even with the very comfortable kingsized bed and inroom jucuzzi the other bedroom had two double beds the kitchen was well supplied the dining area had a very large table totally suitable for  people for the upscale appearance of everything else however the bath was surprisingly plain we are also surprised at how unfresh the fresh linen smelled like our pillowcases which we had replaced with the same smell for eating out our favorite was going to the golden corral which offered the best buffet for the money ive seen there all for  it is just down the street right next to the interstate amenities included  swimming pools we enjoyed the fountains pool complex the best it was also the largest they were  well maintained tennis courts the location is perfect for everything in the area we enjoyed the universal studios and islands of adventure package better than last years disney world experience the rides and things to do were really fun i would also suggest for those not familiar with this area of the state of florida to consider three free outings a rarity in florida one is to go swimming and canoeing at wekiva state park and swimming and tubing at rock springs kelly county park both are very close to apopka which is about a  minute drive we loved the tubing experience and would choose rock springs kelly county park over wekiva if i had to choose only one both are crystal clear springs that bubble out of the ground starting rivers they are classic old florida tubing rock springs is like tubing through what looks like jurassic park without the scary dinasaurs it is totally safe even for small kids if you go a bit further canoeing juniper springs is the best canoe run in florida the current is strong enough that you hardly have to do anything but steer the canoe you rent a canoe from a concessionaire who then picks you up at the end of the run dont miss rocks springs and juniper springs if you have time they are nice breaks from the hustle and bustle of the theme parks overall i dont think you will find a better timeshare complex in the orlando area especially if you are in the lakes or cascades areas they were replacing all the living room area sofas the day we left in our complex i have heard far less positive comments from some staying in older areas of the this very large timeshare complex by sparktrician jul   this is a great place for the whole family and centrally located we had my parents th anniversary their and guest stayed at there sister resort the vistana villages where we own by sportznut jul   i really liked this resort it was very classy and had a great view of a lake beware of the love bug they are these little bugs that are all over orland during certain months we were there in september and they were everywhere by pina updated jul   we stayed in the resort in  with friends of ours who own a unit  it was probably the nicest resort catered to children they are many pools to choose from so the kids have a variety the kids had a wonderful time and so did the adults george by andale apr   nice clean resort with plenty to do  close to everything service at the pool bar restaurant  general store were understaffed causing longer than normal wait times we only visited  of the  pools but they were very nice  but get there early for chairs would stay here again by mmcdermot apr   we own a unit here and love it kids don t even want to leave the grounds there is so much to do clean and safe by rwarner mar   i stayed here in  and i really enjoyed it by mrack mar   fantastic by lambros mar   we have stayed here a couple of times in the past few yearsit is a wonderful resortlots of conveniences like the onsite pizza hut restaurant beautiful pool areasthe newer units are beautifully decoratedthe close access to all the disney parks is greatyou will really enjoy this resort by dhanson mar   this is a beautiful and very friendly resort to stay at i own two timeshares here and always look forward to coming back to visit by karenritter jan   very nice resort my children love staying here we do not own a timeshare we always rent from someone else the resort is everything you would want in a vacation you dont have to worry about your children walking around because its all secured maybe someday we will own a timeshare to this resort karen ritter escanabami by aquacat updated dec   everything was just great one remark though dont use your phone to make a phonecalls esp abroad you would be in for a very unpleasant surprise by iansin nov   stayed in cascades in july  and loved it i own in springs week  but havent stayed there cascades are newer units so must have been lucky beautiful  bedroom sleeps  with jacuzzi and loads of activities for all ages if you get tired of disney attractions had another family with us and the  of us had plenty of room and our own space when necessary by maddie oct   must be one of the best apartments ive stayed in its was one of the older units on the site but was large clean and had all modcons washer dryer dishwasher  tvs and airconditioning the disney shuttle bus stopped outside but you would need tranpsort to go further a field excellant by bev updated oct   stayed in nearly new unit in cascades area feb  fabulously large  bdrm most convenient location to all attractions so much to do on site with all the great pools some with great waterfalls islands and poolside cafes one would be hard pressed to find a place that can top this would go back in a flashand we dont even have kids old town in kissimmee nearby too and shopping on i drive by richdan updated oct   everything is exceptional there are large beautiful pools the rooms are very nice too im looking into going back there again by ncdelre updated oct   ive stayed here  times in the last year and half everything is always outstanding close to
