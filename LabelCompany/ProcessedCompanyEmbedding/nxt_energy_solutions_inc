library gulf of mexico multiclient sfd® technology sfd® output data nxt’s survey aircraft carries numerous individual sfd® sensor elements each of which generates its own unique output signal captured as a digital time series  the signal is akin to a waveform with the horizontal axis measuring flight time in seconds and the vertical axis a voltage output v  time readings correspond to a unique gps based surface location and are plotted in the form of a flight line over the survey area nxt’s data interpretation staff analyze deviations such as signal relaxations and spikes and other characteristics within the sfd® signal outputs from the multiple sensors and from this process will identify “anomalous” areas within the survey grid sfd® data is acquired at  samplessecond the signal itself is intended to be an analog representation of the data collected during the flight but is represented as a nonlinear discretetime signal of each sensor’s output voltage signal analysis frequency amplitude and characterpattern changes and interpretation for each sensor is performed to identify prospective areas without the aid of any a priori knowledge of the underlying geotechnical and engineering data along the sfd® flight path the anomalies are also compared with nxt’s database of sfd® signals that have been obtained over various geological features worldwide which serve as templates for interpretation sfd® anomalies are then ranked and categorized according to their assessed prospectivity  anomalous areas which are identified during the sfd® interpretation process are assigned a relative ranking indicative of their assessed trap and reservoir potential some sample sfd® signals are shown below   interpretation of sfd® signals involves a pattern recognition process  based on extensive experience recognizable sfd® signal patterns example above have been empirically correlated to a variety of subsurface geologic conditions which are indicative of areas that are favorable for the formation of fluid traps  the end product of the survey is a formal technical presentation by nxt of the sfd® recommendations report which is a comprehensive summary of the results of the sfd® survey including the following key deliverables  individual sensor response curves which have been fully annotated  sfd® anomaly areas which represent the combined interpretation of multiple sensors and flight lines  nxt’s technical ranking of the sfd® anomalies based on their trap  structural components and reservoir potential and   an integrated prospect map of the entire survey area illustrating the ranked anomalies   because the sfd® interpretation process is largely qualitative nxt has developed a ranking system to evaluate each identified anomaly “lead” the overall ranking is then reflected as two components – a trap ranking and a reservoir quality ranking each recommended sfd® lead area is assigned a number to denote trap quality and a letter to denote fluid presence indicators a sample ranking system is illustrated below   trap indicators   reservoir indicators  fair trap potential c no reservoir potential indicated  good trap potential c poor reservoir potential  very good trap potential b minor reservoir potential  excellent trap potential b moderate reservoir potential     b good reservoir potential     a very good reservoir potential     a excellent reservoir potential     provided that the survey has been performed in a regular grid pattern nxt normally recommends a  km by  km line spacing or a quasigrid pattern ie  km by  km the results are often represented in the form of a prospectivity map   in order to map the assessed prospectivity of an area the qualitative sfd® ranking must be further quantified in cases where a grid pattern is flown using a scoring system nxt will create a prospectivity grid with hot colors indicating the higher quality lead areas versus cold colors showing lower assessed prospectivity areas  this map provides a contoured summary of the sfd® recommended lead areas and shows the estimated spatial extent and quality of the sfd® identified prospects   sfd news  nxt energy solutions inc
