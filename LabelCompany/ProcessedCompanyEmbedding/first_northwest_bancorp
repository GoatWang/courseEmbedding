storydespite a strong capital position and attractive credit metrics fnwb trades at just  of tangible book valuea number of shareholderfriendly catalysts exist expect the first a share repurchase announcement in qcommunity banks are longterm winners the hemlock team remains extremely bullish on community banks we believe the entire sector has and will continue to benefit from three key trends over the next several years  improving credit loan growth and consolidation we prefer the neighborhood banks over the national entities for two reasons first generally speaking the smaller firms maintain relatively straightforward balance sheets avoiding many of the elaborate hard to assess assets and liabilities that are typically present at the national institutions in essence we believe the community banks are more transparent and therefore provide us greater confidence in the reported book value and ultimately are easier to value second when evaluating real estate we believe there is significant value in local market knowledge and only the community banks can consistently provide this level of expertise as loan growth increases across the sector we are betting on the local operators to select the bestperforming investments to ensure we are able to capitalize on this secular growth story the hemlock team follows approximately  of the most attractive community banks in the united states we have developed a proprietary system to rank each bank stock based on its fiveyear appreciation potential one of our favorites is first northwest bancorp nasdaqfnwb first northwest bancorp with a market cap of  million and  million in assets fnwb operates as the holding company for first federal savings  loan association founded in  the bank serves western washington via nine local branches the business model consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds to originate residential and commercial loans over the last twelve months fnwbs asset quality strengthened and now has reached elite levels the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio totaled just  in the most recent quarter versus  a year ago in january  the bank completed its conversion from the mutual to stock form organization the demutualization process coupled with a stock offering raised plenty of capital which creates a number of near and longterm catalysts catalysts with a tangible equity to asset tea ratio of over  fnwb is overcapitalized relative to our coverage universe average tea ratio of  the substantial liquidity is critical to driving shareholder value as it provides the wherewithal to pay dividends repurchase shares and ramp loan growth trading at  of tangible book value we expect fnwb to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter of  by law the company must wait one year from completion of the demutualization to begin to buy back shares at the current valuation every share repurchased will be immediately accretive as we inch closer to january  the oneyear anniversary of the conversation the multiple will increase as the market anticipates a stock buyback announcement the combination of actual repurchases and the multiple boost should provide a doubledigit return over the next  months with a multiyear investment horizon the return potential looks even better we expect fnwb to follow the path of so many other shareholderfriendly demutualized banks the company will continue to repurchase shares as long as they trade below tangible book value subsequently fnwb is likely to issue a dividend attracting a whole new class of incomefocused investors willing to award the bank a healthier valuation multiple the combination of dividends stock repurchases and multiple expansion is quite likely to please longterm equity holders who purchase shares at current levels two to three years down the road we view the acquisition of fnwb as a very realistic possibility as we mentioned in a previous article here comes the sun nasdaqsnbc bancorp the banking community is in midst of a challenging situation despite a low net interest margin environment there are limited organic growth opportunities available further rising compliance costs are encouraging banks to increase assets thereby spreading the expense over a larger base as banks look to expand the most logical approach is to acquire smaller peers for an acquirer fnwb offers tremendous excess capital and a highquality portfolio conclusion fnwb is one of the most attractive banks in our coverage universe despite a strong capital position and attractive credit metrics the company trades at less than  of tangible book value due to its small market capitalization fnwb is anonymous to most and a compelling opportunity for the valuecentric investor
