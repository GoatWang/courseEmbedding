    add to flipboard magazine power reit loses what now tom konrad cfa on april nd the court ruled against power reit nysepw in the summary judgement phase of its litigation with norfolk southern corp nysensc and wheeling and lake erie railroad wle  at issue were if nsc and wle were in default on a lease of  miles of track and a number of claims surrounding the lease and if they owed power reits legal fees under the lease had power reit prevailed on any of a number of counts it could have been worth as much as  dollars a share to power reit shareholders  as it is power reit still has the option to appeal and there are a couple of claims against power reit which will need to be decided in a status conference scheduled by the court on april th or at trial  these remaining claims regard whether power reit acted improperly when it reorganized itself into a holding company which owns its predecessor entity the pittsburgh  west virginia railway  according to david lesser power reits ceo nsc and wle have said in court that it is impossible to show financial harm because of these claims and so i expect them to be settled or dropped at the at the status conference unless power reit decides to appeal grounds for appeal i found the ruling shocking in that i did not expect much at all to be decided in summary judgement  while i thought many of power reits claims were weak i thought others such as default under the books and records clause of the lease and the payment of legal fees were quite strong  another investor who has read the judgement told me he was truly shocked how one sided this went through not that it matters but makes me wonder if the judge was corrupted or biased somehow to me the ruling seemed very biased as well and im sure it seemed so to lesser judging from a short conversation with him  he felt the judge had gone far beyond the bounds of summary judgment and was even creating new rights under the lease where none had existed before i dont know if any of this constitutes grounds for appeal but i am confident that if pw were to appeal nsc and wle would again fight the appeal vigorously and the company could easily be left to pay even more legal bills than it has to now  whatever the grounds i dont think such an appeal would be a costeffective way to create value for shareholders valuing the remains due to a very timely note from another investor who had seen the ruling before i did i was able to sell all of the client holdings of pw in accounts i manage but i did not have time to sell my own before the stock fell below  and began to plummet shortly thereafter trading was halted and power reit made a press regarding the ruling when the market opens thursday the only remaining questions  are if power reit will appeal and what the stock worth now  since i dont think an appeal would be in shareholders interests and lesser is the largest shareholder an appeal seems unlikely  hence i will focus on the remaining value  this ruling means that the company will be able to write off for tax purposes the  million value of a settlement account under the lease because the account is essentially uncollectible  this writeoff allows the next  million worth of dividends on power reits common and preferred stock to be taxed as return of capital rather than income  the common stock does not currently pay a dividend while the preferred stock pays a  annual dividend based on its  par value or  per preferred share annually  power reits most recent shareholder update puts funds from operations ffo available to pay dividends on both classes of stock at  million annually slide    thousand of this is needed to pay annual dividends on  million of preferred stock with the remaining  million available to pay the legal expenses which are the majority of the accounts payable at  million  approximately five quarters of free cash flow will be needed for accounts payable before the dividend on the common stock can be resumed  there are currently  million shares outstanding which will probably grow as the company continues to pay stock based compensation  let us assume conservatively that power reit resumes its dividend in late  at which time it has  million common shares outstanding  then ffo per share would be  easily sufficient to resume its former  annual dividend while retaining significant capital to fund future growth  this dividend would now be categorized as return of capital so shareholders would not have to pay taxes on it until they sold the stock when it would be taxed as capital gains usually at a much more favorable rate than income  pw could choose to pay a higher dividend but given its plans to rapidly expand its renewable energy holdings i would expect it to retain some capital for growth  at any reasonable dividend rate the tax writeoff is large enough to ensure all dividends count as return of capital for well over a decade a  dividend yield seems reasonable for a tiny but growing reit like pw depending on how much investors value the tax advantages of the dividend and the growth prospects  a  yield would put pw  per share in late  a  dividend would put the stock at  per share  discounting that by  to account for the one to two year wait for the dividend to resume i see the companys shares to be worth between  and  per share upsides there are a number of possible upsides to this estimate  on page  of the same investor presentation the company valued its assets based on discount rates currently being paid on the open market for similar assets  the jewel in the crown is the railroad lease which has similar cash flow characteristics as a perpetual bond from nsc  valued at the  discount rate nsc pays on long term debt the lease is worth  per share  at a more conservative  which i think pw might be able to get if it sold the lease to the highest bidder its still worth  per share  such a sale would do a lot to increase the current stock price by allowing power reit to repay its most expensive debt andor pay legal bills and resume the dividend sooner the end of the litigation might also solve the problem of expensive debt by making banks more willing to provide financing with the perceived risks of the lawsuit are gone  refinancing existing debt at a lower rate could immediately free up cash flow to reduce accounts payable and resume the dividend sooner possibly at a higher rate without the distraction of  the lawsuit power reit could continue the process of turning itself into a yieldco by buying land under solar and wind parks with mostly debt financing  given the large tax advantages of its reit structure combined with the return of capital treatment of its distributions for years to come it might be able to resume and begin to grow its dividend much more quickly than i outlined above conclusion at  a share where pw closed on the day of the summary judgment the company falls within the range of fair value based on when i would expect it to resume its dividend  as the market adjusts to the new reality look for buying opportunities below  or chances to sell if it quickly advances above  without news such as a refinancing of debt which has the potential to increase cash flow to me the preferred stock pwpa seems like a much more attractive proposition  power reit has plenty of cash flow to continue paying the preferred dividend and now that dividend will be categorized as return of capital for the foreseeable future  even if the preferred dividend were to be suspended it would have to be paid in arrears before the common dividend was resumed  disclosure long pw pwpra disclaimer past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results  this article contains the current opinions of the author

at the end of the tunnel it could have been the first yieldco october   by tom konrad freelance writer consultant i first became interested in power reit nyse mktpw in  because of the companys plans to become what would have been the first uslisted yieldco ie a clean energy power producer paying a high level of reliable dividends to investors the company was an infrastructure real estate investment trust reit with a single asset its subsidiary pittsburgh  west virginia railway pwv which owned  miles of track leased to norfolk southern corp nysensc which had in turn subleased the track to wheeling  lake erie wle the rent on the rail asset was fixed at  per year with no adjustment for inflation meaning that the expenses of remaining a public company had been taking a larger and larger share of income   in  david lesser was an executive with experience running reits and a passion for renewable energy looking for his next opportunity he realized that solar and wind farms produce reliable long term cash flows but at the time there were no publicly traded vehicles for income oriented investors to benefit from these cash flows  he saw the opportunity for a reit to buy the land underlying wind and solar development lease it back to the wind and solar operators and deliver the payments to investors in the form of a sustainable yield  lesser and his allies saw pwv as an appropriate vehicle for this and began buying its stock  in  he became chairman and ceo and formed the holding company power reit to own pwv and future renewable energy real estate assets as a publicly listed holding companynative advertisement the immense appetite that investors have shown for the yeildcos launched by renewable energy developers in  and  has amply demonstrated lessers business plan to be a good one but pwvs railroad asset has side tracked its execution  the company has only done two smallish solar deals because of the distraction side tracked on west end branch the side track started with a minor dispute over legal fees  the lease is somewhat unusual in that according to the court filings of the lessees it was designed to give the lessees as much control of the property as possible without taking legal ownership under us tax laws  since pwv retained ownership of the property but ceased to be an operating company when the lease was signed the lease provides for the lessees to pay any of pwvs expenses which are necessary or desirable to protect its interest in the property unless those expenses were solely for the benefit of its shareholders when lesser received notification in  that wle intended to sell a part of the property known as west end branch he consulted with his attorneys to understand pwvs rights and obligations under the lease while wle does have the right under the lease to sell parts of the property it does not need as long as it follows the appropriate procedures it refused to pay the resulting attorneys fees  since the lease seemed to be clear to lesser and his attorneys in this regard after several attempts to get wle to pay this refusal became an incurable default under the lease   since the default was incurable pwvs only recourse was to foreclose wle and nsc wanted to maintain what had become a very attractive agreement in their favor over the fifty years since it had initially been signed and so they filed a civil action against pwv and power reit to prevent the foreclosure in early   over the last two years increasing amounts of pw management and resources have been required in the litigation against two larger and much better funded companies but lesser feels firmly that the time and expense will eventually prove to be very attractive investments  not only does a reasonable interpretation of the lease provide for wle and nsc to pay all the expenses which seem to be a clear example of expenses which are necessary or desirable to maintain pwvs interest in its property but numerous other violations of the letter of lease have come to light since the initial dispute about west end branch legal fees   if pw is able to foreclose a bookkeeping settlement account under the lease worth at least  million and as much as  million will be due and it or part of it may be due even if the court finds the lease not in default   the state of litigation the current litigation is complex with multiple accusations in both directions  power reit has posted an archive of most of the court documents on its website  the most recently filed documents are each partys opposition to the others motion for summary judgement and these documents do an excellent job of summarizing each partys position in a very complex case perhaps the most remarkable feature is just how far apart the two sides are  power reit spells out several counts on which wle and nsc have violated the wording of the lease  wle and nsc deny them all and say that lesser is a moneygrabbing capitalist whose intention has all along been to manufacture defaults under the lease to extract money out of them  their main argument is that the parties had been doing everything their way all along and so that should not change even if the lease says otherwise  they also claim somewhat hypocritically considering the above argument that lesser is trying to change the terms of the lease and that should constitute a default im not a legal expert and i have no way of knowing which side is in the right when it comes to the legal issues  how much does the intent behind the lease count compared to the words of the lease itself  how important are the previous actions of the partiesrewpage all that said my laymans reading of the lease tends to support pws side in almost all cases i am also repeatedly shocked that wle and nsc repeatedly say things in their testimony that i find impossible to believe  for instance i know from my many interactions with lesser that his business plan for power reit was always been to turn the company into a yieldco the lease is a distraction even if it may turn out to be a very lucrative one   the evidence in the case also seems to directly contradict some of their testimony  for example on page  of document  plaintiff opposition to pwv motion for summary judgement they state that the west end branch invoice i discussed above did not relate to the west end branch sale and that the attorneys testimony supported this statement  yet the attorney said that he recalled reviewing the lease with lesser for the general purpose of determining pwvs rights under the lease relating to the sale of such property document  pp i found this contradiction because the opposing sides motions seemed to directly contradict each other when it came to the evidence in the exhibits  having found one such contradiction i expect there are more likely outcome and timing with the opposition documents filed the parties have two more weeks to file another round of attempts to refute each other after which the judge will decide on each of the motions for summary judgement  given that the parties are so far apart it seems unlikely that many if any of the issues will be decided in summary judgment   at the judges behest the parties have also agreed to attempt mediation and have agreed on a mediator  this seems even less likely to lead anywhere given the complete lack of common ground although if the judge were to rule mostly in one partys favor in summary judgment the other party might be spurred to compromise on the remaining points rather than to go to trial before a clearly unsympathetic judge the most likely course seems unsuccessful mediation leading to a trial in early   i have no idea how long a trial will take but with three years having past since the dispute began the judge has been pushing for the speediest possible resolution   if wle and nsc get their way on every count the lease will continue as it was before pws attempt to foreclose  the company will be out its substantial legal fees but will be able to write off the  million at which the settlement account is carried on its tax records as an asset  this will cause future distributions to pw common and preferred shareholders to be characterized as return of capital rather than income increasing their value to taxable shareholders if pw is able to foreclose the settlement account will be due as well as the likely reimbursement of its legal costs  it will be able to release or sell the track at market rates   all this could be quite substantial  million is  per share of common stock which is currently trading around share  the company does have liabilities but it also has other assets such as its solar land and leases and the railroad property itself  conclusion i first bought power reit stock because i saw a very promising yieldco in the making  after this legal case is resolved the company will be able to get back on track to becoming a promising if minor yieldco which takes advantage of the reit tax structure  the only other reit yieldco is hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure nysehasi  the long litigation caused power reit to lose its first mover advantage but it also offers the potential of a substantial upside and limited downside for shareholders  three years have passed since the dispute began but it will likely reach a conclusion before the end of a
