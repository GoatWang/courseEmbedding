the bulls at white bull july  0  author admin i’ve been to the white bull conference in barcelona several times  i go because i always make at least one important connection there  i met harry marshall at white bull four years ago harry would spend three months shadowing me in silicon valley and go on to become part of the bay partners team  last year i met two of our four neal’s running start candidates at white bull  this year the conference had a new look and a new location but the quality attendance and the commitment to entrepreneurs are still at the heart of this invitationonly european tech conference white bull brings a select group of entrepreneurs vcs service companies and media into one location for a three day event  the conference focuses on the latest innovations in europe as well as current trends and issues facing the tech industry  because it is invitationonly the numbers stay low and the entrepreneurs are generally of good quality  it’s easy to get to know other people quickly and have multiple conversations with them i’ve never attended a conference that gives more service and attention to entrepreneurs  the event kicksoff with a full day dedicated to helping entrepreneurs refine their presentations and pitches  the conference brings in mentors from all walks of the tech world to give feedback and encouragement with the intent of making the entrepreneurs shine throughout the conference  i don’t know any other conference that invests this much time and energy into practically helping the startup community  perhaps that’s why so many of the white bull bully award winners go on to successful funding rounds and exits such as acquisitions i got to speak at the conference in a session called “beyond the pitch reality check”  my goal was to tackle some the toughest challenges entrepreneurs are facing right now by getting them to open up and share  entrepreneurs are often dealing with very difficult decisions on their own neal oddens and mario aguilera from neal’s running start joined me on stage to share their experiences as entrepreneurs and how they got a very big reality check during their stay in san francisco  both have overcome those challenges and moved on but they face new worries every day like all entrepreneurs  we had a great time having a “real” conversation with the audience  i hope we were able to reinvigorate some of the companies in the audience with ideas and solutions for moving forward our reality check session is just another example of how white bull goes the extra mile to help entrepreneurs  we tackled some issues most entrepreneurs either don’t have mentors to guide them through or are afraid to ask for help because they assume they’re the only one experiencing the problem  it was nice for everyone to realize they’re not alone in facing makeorbreak decisions every day and there’s a network of people with wisdom and experience to help them thank you to elizabeth and farley and the white bull team for having me back  once again it was a great conference and i look forward to next year   no comments  categories uncategorized china and the us can’t we all just get along may  0  author admin in a time when geopolitical relations are strained one company out of kansas is looking to form a collaboration between us and chinese doctors for better healthcare services i’ve talked about the need for regional innovation hubs  but sometimes there’s a need to combine knowledge to bring about new ideas  for example chinese and western medicine  as china’s population exploded so did its healthcare needs  the us is facing similar strains  so the question is can companies from both countries come together for better healthcare solutions  that’s the idea behind kansasbased preferus i’m an investor in preferus and i recently went to china with them to observe firsthand how they’re joining forces with chinese healthcare professionals and hospitals to create an entirely different approach to hospital services management and physician training preferus has deep expertise on the chinese healthcare market  after spending years working in china founder michael franz developed an understanding of the chinese culture and the struggles the government faced to serve over a billion people with adequate healthcare  as public hospitals strained under the needs of a growing population a private healthcare market emerged  franz saw the opportunity to help private chinese institutions accelerate their medical training in fields like cardiology orthopedics spine total joint care and sports medicine  in addition as china builds more hospitals to serve its large population experts in hospital management are also needed preferus partnered with cedars sinai oklahoma heart hospital texas back institute and kerlanjobe institute to create a training program for doctors nurses and administrators  chinese doctors travel to kansas to immerse themselves in english specifically medical terms in english for two months then they spend four more months training on the latest techniques in cardiology orthopedics and sports medicine  preferus’s training program is helping speed up readiness at chinses hospitals and better serve patients  in fact working with kerlanjobe inspired preferus and its partner hospital in china to open the very first comprehensive sports medicine institute in a shanghai public hospital  sports medicine is in growing demand in china so preferus worked with its newly trained chinese doctors to make it a specialty of the local public hospital we talk about globalization sometimes as a bad word as it can threaten jobs and wages  but this is globalization in a good way  if we can tap into the expertise of one group of people to make life better for another that is a good thing franz and his team are seeding the reinvention of the public and private health industry for the chinese market while holding true to chinese values and cultures working with investors and hospital partners in china preferus’s services were so wellreceived that they were eventually asked to manage hospitals across the region at the same time us doctors get a fresh and new perspective from their chinese colleagues and the chance to practice healthcare in a completely different environment the sharing economy has been linked to sharing possessions like cars and houses  but the sharing economy can also be about sharing knowledge that improves lives cooperation between businesses in various countries even with their political counterparts have strained relations are key to gaining understanding innovation and dare i say peace among nations i look forward to my next trip to china to see what this expanding relationship between us and chinese healthcare professionals can achieve for you readers think about how you can create a collaboration with counterparts in unexpected parts of the world to better improve your services thinking products and customer experiences looking under a new rock may be the key to a competitive edge no comments  categories uncategorized what does it take to be a ceo may  0  author admin it had been  days since meeting mr neal dempsey in person at neal’s running start in san francisco and in  days your life can be completely transformed on day  one year ago i was nervously arriving in san francisco having taken the biggest leap of my company’s life  i had committed to spend a month in san francisco under neal dempsey’s mentorship to see if i could take my company to new heights  on that th day i was standing with neal in front of mba students at the university of washington foster school of business sharing my story on how i went from entrepreneur to a ceo of a fastgrowing company with investors fortune  customers and offices in two locations in  days i went from mentee to mentor these students were smart engaged and impressively enough some already had startups underway  we had taken different paths to entrepreneurship  the uw pushes its students to be founders of companies and brings in mentors like neal and the vast successful organizations in the seattle area such as amazon boeing microsoft and starbucks saskatoon is a different story  there aren’t many mentors from big tech companies waiting to offer guidance to saskatoon entrepreneurs and startup companies but whether you come from seattle’s wealth of success or saskatoon’s hard work getitdone work ethic everyone has the same questions – what does it take to be a ceo and run a successful company that’s why i came to help below are a few questions i wanted to highlight from our almost  hour conversation what do you look for in a ceo neal “i look for three things in ceo do they have personality passion and perseverance it’s always a combination of these things never just one” what makes a great company neal “i can tell you all of my best investments have never had a clear straight path to success in fact some of my best investments almost didn’t make it we asked ourselves do we invest more do we shut it down see it’s more like a rollercoaster with ups and downs” how would you suggest building up your leadership team katherine “i have always hired for our biggest pain point at the time in order to improve the team and take that next step i have a sales and marketing background my first hire was our cto romeo genius developer” what do you look for in an investor katherine “i look for a few things but mostly how do they treat people and what experience do they have in our space money is important but both the investor and entrepreneur should walk if it’s not the right fit on other levels” is it lonely being a ceo katherine “what a great question yes yes it totally is however since the neal’s running start program the four of us have been able to create honest relationships where we can go to each other and say  “woah i have no idea how to solve this do you guys” mentorship happens at all levels — with all people” what percentage of ceos can take it all the way neal “you have to understand that running a business is a long and difficult marathon that can go  –  years some of our ceo’s just get tired or what i call “founders fatigue” and don’t want to do it anymore it’s hard i would say only a small percentage of founders can take their startup to an initial liquidity event and that is if they decide they even want too” do you have a number katherine “a phone number sure i haven’t been asked for that in a while just kidding i don’t have a magic number for selling the sky’s the limit and i will worry about it when we get there setting a goal can also be setting a limitation” overall my time at uw was welcoming refreshing and inspiring it was so fascinating watching the students come alive on how they were turning their ideas into a reality this is what makes the business world go round i mentor at the university of washington and in saskatoon with our burgeoning startup community because people like neal were kind enough to help me along the way  i’ve come to learn the value of community like the strong one here at the university of washington  just  days ago i didn’t know the names of the tech startup founders down the hall from me in saskatoon  now we’re a thriving community helping each other learn and grow neal embodies that sense of giving back and community  as i walked the campus i couldn’t help but see dempsey hall and dempsey indoor neal is extremely modest and humble about his success but his presence like his name on the campus buildings is felt and appreciated i’m looking forward to visiting the uw students again and following up on their journey who knows how far they’ll come over the next year  days can change your world no comments  categories uncategorized saskatoon swagger march  0  author admin back in november i wrote about reaching beyond silicon valley link to blog post to encourage innovation in other cities and towns  the next industrial revolution will be all about technology and cities who are not preparing for that may be left behind like we’ve seen in some of the regions who relied too long on outdated manufacturing and energy economies  a couple of weeks ago i visited saskatoon canada to learn more about their burgeoning tech industry and how to support the startups in the area  i attended an event called “flip the switch” which was about turning on the tech industry infrastructure needed to make saskatoon entrepreneurs successful without having to move to silicon valley canada is the fastest growing country in the g and saskatoon is the rd fastest growing city in canada  saskatoon was also named one of three cities to watch for tech job growth in canada  with travel bans and uncertainty in america this year canada has been trying to lure many tech companies to open offices there  most tech companies find vancouver most like silicon valley but like silicon valley it is very expensive  toronto has attracted many companies with its proximity to top universities  but saskatoon is making its mark and i thought it was worth exploring how this city and the province of saskatchewan is working to incentivize tech growth i met with several tech companies in saskatoon and listened to their company pitches their successes and their challenges  i also met with several government officials who were kind enough to provide some of the data and statistics i cited in the above paragraph the biggest difference between silicon valley and any other city or area that wants to grow its tech business is simply the infrastructure  silicon valley lives and breathes tech every day  we have universities vcs entrepreneurs large tech enterprises lawyers marketing people etc who all understand the tech industry  that adds up to a large amount of resources that are completely devoted to helping technology companies grow and thrive and have unprecedented experience  deals get done in coffee shops and at school dropoffs because everyone is in the business  that’s very hard to duplicate therefore what cities like saskatoon need is more tech companies  that is why they had this event  they want to demonstrate that saskatoon and saskatchewan have the people and infrastructure to support growing tech companies that may or may not be true right now but as more tech companies look to set up hubs in canada saskatoon could be worth a look  there are solid universities in the area growing investments and the government is committed to making the area attractive to tech companies  plus the cost of living is very attractive  in the past the region has mostly brought in oil and gas agriculture mining and ranching  these industries are ripe for innovation but there’s also startups in enterprise and consumer software  coconut calendar is a good example  as you recall katherine regnier the ceo of coconut calendar is one of the neal’s running start entrepreneurs and she organized this event to get the tech companies organized  that’s a great start  just getting the support systems talking to each other will go a long way to retaining and attracting new tech companies since my return the potential investment opportunities have been encouraging i have been contacted by a few saskatoon based companies as well as two in calgary they all have early sales traction and in one case multiple millions in revenue all with minimum levels of investment or no outside funding that’s a nod to the hard work and dedication of smalltown people who expect to succeed on their own merits  i’m continuing to investigate these companies and have been happy to receive several other referrals from the saskatchewan government saskatoon has a long way to go before it becomes a new technology hub  but this kind of commitment from the local community businesses universities and the government are exactly what i was talking about in my previous blog  tech innovation is going to have to spread out and saskatoon is a great example of how a city can make a strategic plan to be wellpositioned for the next economy  i look forward to my next visit for more information have a look at a radio and tv interview katherine and i did during my visit httpsaskatoonctvnewscavideoclipidbinidplaylistpagenum httpckomcomarticlelocalstartupwantsignitesasktechindustry no comments  categories uncategorized neal’s running start entrepreneurs offer their top  tips and lessons february  0  author admin last week i had the pleasure of inviting all the neal’s running start entrepreneurs to aspen colorado for a reunion  it’s been a little over a year since these four entrepreneurs from scattered parts of the globe were chosen to be part of the nrs  program  their month with us was a nonstop marathon of lessons on business from silicon valley’s finest  i wanted to see how they’ve applied what they learned since leaving i thought i’d share some of the lessons we talked about as they can apply for any entrepreneur  and they also had some good tips for any entrepreneur who might be facing the same challenges   we’ll start with some lessons they took back applied to their companies and made a big difference top  positive outcomes cash flow – cash is king so master your cash flow management and that will make a huge difference for the survival and growth of the company embrace change – if what you’re doing isn’t working change  if you have to make changes do it fast and decisively raise as much capital as possible – if cash is king so is capital you’ll need it to grow and keep up with the market  don’t worry about taking too much capital as investors will only give you what you need and observe you how stretch to make it work  take capital from multiple sources including vcs angels and government sources if you can the right customers – everyone needs customers but choose the right customers who fit with your longterm vision minimize customizations that can slow down product development the right team – hiring the right team members can take burdens off the ceo and bring new inspiration the wrong hire can be detrimental to the company brand reputation and finances  hire carefully but fire quickly top  challenges cash flow – the inverse of mastering your cash flow is not having the cash flow to master all the entrepreneurs have learned the importance of revenues and if you don’t have cash you must solve that problem first before anything else can happen  have a backup plan or a cushion in case fundraising takes longer than expected product – managing the product direction can prove difficult when you’re being pulled by customers in various directions pick a vision but go where the money is  that’s a hard tightrope to walk managing growth – once you have investment and cash deciding how best to apply it to manage growth is challenging from which hires to make to what rd investments will yield the most results managing growth is complicated making cuts – sometimes you must make the hard call and cut a team member who isn’t working out as the company grows sometimes you must cut people to manage cash flow  but no matter the reason in a small business letting people go is difficult because it’s personal don’t give away the company – at an early stage people will be vying for stock while you need to give some away to get investment and a committed executive team don’t lose your ability to call the shots at this early stage protip one of the entrepreneurs had a tip that everyone liked  make a one page list of your yearly goals  keep it where you can see it every day  that will help everyone manage tough decisions and prioritize activities i’m proud of the entrepreneurs  running a company is never an easy climb  there are always ups and downs  i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again no company i’ve ever worked with has been a straight shot to the top  they all face challenges as they go  our reunion was a chance for us to share the ups and downs of entrepreneurial life and have some fun in the mountains at the same time i’ll continue to keep you posted on our entrepreneurs  we haven’t seen the last of them yet and i look forward to more great times in 0 and beyond   no comments  categories uncategorized reaching beyond silicon valley october    author admin i’ve spent the last few years meeting entrepreneurs from around the globe  i’ve been to conferences like web summit white bull and many meetups across the us and europe  there’s lots of talent and ideas outside of silicon valley which is probably no surprise to anyone who lives outside the bay area  however many vcs and investors tend to keep their dollars in this region  of course there are some large vc firms with overseas presence but the majority keep their dollars in the bay area  perhaps it’s time we widened our scope because the tech disruption isn’t going to be limited to silicon valley it’s true that the reason vcs are focused on entrepreneurs in silicon valley or those who are willing to move to silicon valley is because of the vast resources and networks here while other cities and countries have tried to duplicate the silicon valley mentality and culture no one has succeeded yet perhaps it’s because san francisco and the bay area has a history or risktaking on crazy ventures  from the barbary coast to the gold rush to a computer industry founded in garages the bay area has always defied convention socially and in business the disparity in funding risks between silicon valley and european vcs is another good example  two million is a seed round of funding in silicon valley while that’s at least an a round of funding in europe if not a b round  and for better or worse silicon valley vcs are more likely to keep investing in a company to help them pivot if the first idea doesn’t work whereas european vcs are much more conservative on that front having completed the neal’s running start program for entrepreneurs outside the us earlier this year i saw firsthand how entrepreneurs can flourish with the right guidance and network  neal’s running start took four entrepreneurs from outside the country and brought them here for just thirty days  i was amazed at how these eager minds transformed completely in such a short amount of time  what would happen if they had consistent access to silicon valley without the costs of moving to silicon valley over the next year i’m going to focus on learning about and talking about methods to make tech innovation more inclusive for everyone  we have massive industrial shifts happening across the globe the world economic forum’s report on deep shifts technological tipping points make it clear how technology will completely disrupt social and economic systems in the next 0 years  that means we have to be thinking and innovating not just in silicon valley but across the globe if we want to be prepared for changes in major industries and social and ethical dilemmas these shifts will give cities across the us and the globe the opportunity to be the new centers of innovation on a variety of technological advancements from transportation to ai to big data and privacy issues i want to be part of helping smaller cities that may not be on the vc firm radar meet their innovation potential  i want to help entrepreneurs educators and city officials make these shifts  i’d welcome your input as i evolve my thinking and research on this topic i hope to foster open discussions at conferences universities and municipalities looking to lead the way for these coming changes  if you see me at a conference strike up a conversation  i’d be happy to hear your viewpoint  and if you’d like to host a discussion drop me a line as i’ll be planning various speaking and meetup possibilities look for more on this page and i look forward to hearing your thoughts and input as we look to grow the silicon valley ecosystem beyond the bay area no comments  categories uncategorized that’s a wrap july    author admin it’s been a month now since the neal’s running start gang left san francisco  i’ve started to get back to my normal routines but i miss their energy and the fun times  i’m currently enjoying a trip to london to watch the wimbledon matches and it happens to be canada day so i am reminiscing about my time with the european and one canadian entrepreneur i am compelled  to share a bit of what happened during the inaugural neal’s running start program  but don’t worry because there’s much more to come  we videotaped many of our sessions together so look for a full video series on the neal’s running start experience soon  i think anyone who is trying to make it through a goal or a challenge can take something away from what these entrepreneurs experienced and learned so i hope the video will be a way for everyone to do their own running start program and kickstart an important goal in your life as a runner i will relate their journey to training for a run or a race  everyone starts with the end goal in mind – you’re going to get fit and cross the finish line and be the best runner since usain bolt  for entrepreneurs they start a company with success in mind – they can see it already  they are the next zuckerberg  movies will be made about their ascent and how they changed the world day one  day one o f a run starts out fun and energetic but your dreams of running a marathon on the first day rarely come true  instead day one only serves to show you just how far you have to go and just how out of shape you really are for our entrepreneurs day one was similarly “cometojesusy”  they each had to present their company to a group of investors on day one  but the first day was just like the first day of a run – a metric for how far they really had to go and for some of them how out of shape their companies really were there were inaccuracies and sometimes flat out fiction in their presentations which were too easy to spot and call out  the presentation designs needed work  their whole flow needed work  and truly a presentation is often a reflection of the state of the business itself  so flaws in the presentation reflect real flaws in the underlying business i tried to not be too hard on them and ease them in with gentle critiques  but by day  the gloves were off  we only had 0 days and no time to waste so it was time to throw niceties aside and get to work the next few weeks would prove to be exhausting exhilarating and sometimes brutal  each day had an uphill run on the schedule and like us runners i’m sure they sometimes wanted to dry heave at the top of each hill or sit down and rest for a while  we kept pushing even literally having them dunk themselves in ice cold water for one investor pitch but the oneonone meetings i had with each entrepreneur were where all the exercises and learnings came together  one entrepreneur skirted closer to the death of their company than any entrepreneur wants to come  but through close direction that company turned around and was on track by the end of the 0 days more than one realized they have to move their company  some to silicon valley and some just to where their customers are  but most realized they were going to have to physically move their companies which is not an easy task they all found ways to use their greatest strengths to overcome their greatest challenges  one had a “take no prisoners” approach to getting big things accomplished every day and that helped the entrepreneur almost completely overhaul their business approach during the time in san francisco  another was excellent at networking and took advantage of every conference meeting and connection they could make while in town  yet another was eternally optimistic which i think is a key ingredient for any entrepreneur to persevere through the many obstacles that get in the way of growing a company  and one transformed their stubbornness into an advantage to not give up and dig until they found a solution to the problem rather than allowing fixation to get them stuck on one problem because none of these entrepreneurs had ever spent time in silicon valley they were the most naïve early stage founders i’ve worked with  the lack of mentorship and guidance available in their respective cities really impacted their mindset and how they operated their businesses  therefore each entrepreneur found at least one other mentor besides me who really inspired them or understood their unique market challenges  that is one of the clear advantages of being in silicon valley  not only is there a plethora of wisdom and experience here there’s an unspoken code that you help others  one of the entrepreneurs remarked how willing everyone he asked was to meet and share experience and ideas  whereas in his home country he rarely found mentors with a willingness to be so open and helpful unless you paid them for their time  in silicon valley wisdom flows through friendly meetings at coffee shops offices and the rosewood happy hour  tapping into a braintrust of experience and listening well to what those advisers have to say is a critical ingredient to success all the entrepreneurs walked away with their eyes wide open but now comes the critical part – what they do as they return to their companies away from the silicon valley bubble if you will  i know they are all struggling right now to fight the old inertia and apply the lessons learned so we’ll followup with them soon and check on their progress they all need financing so i’ll be tracking that progress over the next few months but first i want you to get to know each of them and hear for yourselves their unique individual stories and journey through their 0 days in the neal’s running start program  look for our video series in the coming weeks  if you’re looking to start a new goal or tackle a challenge join us for the video series and see if you can take some of the lessons learned and apply them to your own path to success until then here are some photos to give you a taste of the entrepreneurs and their time here no comments  categories uncategorized meet antti rikkinen april    author admin many of you know that i started my career in sales  therefore i have a special connection with the sales people of the world  antti rikkinen our third entrepreneur in the neal’s running start program is the founder of zero keyboard and his company is setting out to make life easier for the hardworking neversleeping people in sales zero keyboard is a mobile app that allows people to enter data to salesforce without typing the user simply answers a readymade set of questions with gestures pictures and voice recording  then zero keyboard turns everything into readable explicit information in salesforce  if in my days as a sales rep i could have simply spoke information into my phone and had all my crm information completed i would have probably closed more deals because of the saved time dealing with paperwork and data entry  moreover everyone on my team would have had more comprehensive information about my customer interactions  filling out forms on the road is a real pain for sales people so i saw the appeal of zero keyboard right away while this is antti’s first time as a cofounder of a company he is no stranger to putting himself out there so to speak  if you live in finland you might recognize him from the tv miniseries toisen kanssa  in addition to running a software company antti is also an actor in finland which probably makes him a fantastic sales person as well  we will be filming most of the neal’s running start program and we’re lucky enough to already have a star who is cameraready  this should be fun antti is from helsinki where there has been an emerging tech startup scene recently  in fact we have two entrepreneurs from helsinki in this program  i will be looking for antti to expand his knowledge and experience beyond sales while he’s here  i understand a little bit about that so i’m looking forward to guiding him along that growth path for antti this is an opportunity to make important connections in silicon valley including a partnership or alliance with salesforce “our product is obviously built to serve the salesforce community” said antti  “this opportunity to be so close to the heart of the tech industry including the salesforce headquarters is important to our company  i plan to make the most of the experience and pursue connections at salesforce and beyond while i’m in san francisco and neal’s expertise in my market brings a tremendous learning opportunity” welcome antti twitter rikkinen no comments  categories uncategorized meet mario aguilera march    author admin mario aguilera may currently reside in helsinki but he’s originally from bolivia  he first got the idea for a line of solarpowered backpacks from his days in the bolivian army while training with special forces mario and his unit would spend many days deployed in remote areas  the only reason they had to return to base was to charge their equipment  that’s when he began thinking about wearable technologies that could expand battery life tespack provides a line of designer wearable technology accessories such as backpacks that use solar energy to power devices like laptops and mobile phones  harnessing the natural energy of the sun the tespack wearables provide a continuous power source for devices and is built to withstand rugged outdoors and extreme weather conditions  the company blends fashion with technology and militarygrade endurance designer wearable tech is something new for me but i found mario’s idea fascinating and certainly practical my personal interest in this product is my ability to get lost on long trail runs or overnight hikes and have a wearable technology product keep my gear charged and ready to go this product clearly presents an opportunity for large consumer markets as a limited partner of true ventures who are the largest investors in fitbit this is an area i’m watching closely mario has plenty of background in the clothing industry to support the sleek design of his products  we may both be learning a few new things together but i think the challenge for mario will be focusing his growth potential when there are so many directions he could take this company  that is a challenge i understand well and i look forward to helping him make some smart growth decisions to push forward his smart wearables mario already has a seed round of funding  this trip will help him expand his contacts for the next round as well as make some important contacts in the manufacturing sector and in consumer products and retail sales here in silicon valley “tespack has experienced rapid growth internationally and with that growth comes big challenges such as manufacturing design and distribution channels” said mario “this opportunity comes at just the right time for my company and i’m looking forward to highimpact learning with neal on how to manage a highgrowth consumer company” welcome mario twitter aguileramario no comments  categories uncategorized meet the other neal – neal oddens march    author admin well this is going to be confusing  one of our entrepreneurs is also named neal  neal oddens he even spells his name the same way as i do  therefore i have to choose a new name for him let’s call him oddens for now to save confusion oddens is ceo of increaseonline a company that uses analytics to help companies price and sell their digital media online adtech is something that is near and dear to my vc heart these days i have several investments in adtech companies and it’s a space i think has tremendous potential  that’s why i decided to bring oddens to neal’s running start i also like that this isn’t oddens’ first rodeo  he founded bandenconcurrentnl a dutch ecommerce platform for tires with growth of 0 over  years bandenconcurrentnl has become a market leader and is now a popular household “go to website” for tires in the netherlands  i’m interested to see not only if he can do it again but if he can take increaseonline even further this time oddens hails from amsterdam one of my favorite cities  lately that city has been ripe with new internet talent with the rise of incubators and communities like appsterdam i think there’s a lot of opportunities for increaseonline and for entrepreneurship in amsterdam however as progressive as the dutch startup scene is there is still a largely conservative approach to company growth and investing in the netherlands  i’ve had a couple of angel investments there before and i know the pros and the cons  i hope we can give oddens some real pointers for jumpstarting his company’s growth and taking back some of that wisdom to amsterdam in may so he can pave an aggressive path to even greater success than he’s experienced in the past oddens like his namesake me agrees “while i’ve built a successful company before i feel it’s time for the next level ” said oddens  “i’m excited to spend time with neal learning about how to build a company that reaches farther and grows bigger than i’ve ever managed before  for that i’m going to need a good mentor and i’m so grateful neal has chosen me to be part of this program” welcome neal or um oddens twitter nealoddens  comment  categories uncategorized next page » about neal

who are running with the bulls at white bull july  0  author admin i’ve been to the white bull conference in barcelona several times  i go because i always make at least one important connection there  i met harry marshall at white bull four years ago harry would spend three months shadowing me in silicon valley and go on to become part of the bay partners team  last year i met two of our four neal’s running start candidates at white bull  this year the conference had a new look and a new location but the quality attendance and the commitment to entrepreneurs are still at the heart of this invitationonly european tech conference white bull brings a select group of entrepreneurs vcs service companies and media into one location for a three day event  the conference focuses on the latest innovations in europe as well as current trends and issues facing the tech industry  because it is invitationonly the numbers stay low and the entrepreneurs are generally of good quality  it’s easy to get to know other people quickly and have multiple conversations with them i’ve never attended a conference that gives more service and attention to entrepreneurs  the event kicksoff with a full day dedicated to helping entrepreneurs refine their presentations and pitches  the conference brings in mentors from all walks of the tech world to give feedback and encouragement with the intent of making the entrepreneurs shine throughout the conference  i don’t know any other conference that invests this much time and energy into practically helping the startup community  perhaps that’s why so many of the white bull bully award winners go on to successful funding rounds and exits such as acquisitions i got to speak at the conference in a session called “beyond the pitch reality check”  my goal was to tackle some the toughest challenges entrepreneurs are facing right now by getting them to open up and share  entrepreneurs are often dealing with very difficult decisions on their own neal oddens and mario aguilera from neal’s running start joined me on stage to share their experiences as entrepreneurs and how they got a very big reality check during their stay in san francisco  both have overcome those challenges and moved on but they face new worries every day like all entrepreneurs  we had a great time having a “real” conversation with the audience  i hope we were able to reinvigorate some of the companies in the audience with ideas and solutions for moving forward our reality check session is just another example of how white bull goes the extra mile to help entrepreneurs  we tackled some issues most entrepreneurs either don’t have mentors to guide them through or are afraid to ask for help because they assume they’re the only one experiencing the problem  it was nice for everyone to realize they’re not alone in facing makeorbreak decisions every day and there’s a network of people with wisdom and experience to help them thank you to elizabeth and farley and the white bull team for having me back  once again it was a great conference and i look forward to next year   no comments  categories uncategorized china and the us can’t we all just get along may  0  author admin in a time when geopolitical relations are strained one company out of kansas is looking to form a collaboration between us and chinese doctors for better healthcare services i’ve talked about the need for regional innovation hubs  but sometimes there’s a need to combine knowledge to bring about new ideas  for example chinese and western medicine  as china’s population exploded so did its healthcare needs  the us is facing similar strains  so the question is can companies from both countries come together for better healthcare solutions  that’s the idea behind kansasbased preferus i’m an investor in preferus and i recently went to china with them to observe firsthand how they’re joining forces with chinese healthcare professionals and hospitals to create an entirely different approach to hospital services management and physician training preferus has deep expertise on the chinese healthcare market  after spending years working in china founder michael franz developed an understanding of the chinese culture and the struggles the government faced to serve over a billion people with adequate healthcare  as public hospitals strained under the needs of a growing population a private healthcare market emerged  franz saw the opportunity to help private chinese institutions accelerate their medical training in fields like cardiology orthopedics spine total joint care and sports medicine  in addition as china builds more hospitals to serve its large population experts in hospital management are also needed preferus partnered with cedars sinai oklahoma heart hospital texas back institute and kerlanjobe institute to create a training program for doctors nurses and administrators  chinese doctors travel to kansas to immerse themselves in english specifically medical terms in english for two months then they spend four more months training on the latest techniques in cardiology orthopedics and sports medicine  preferus’s training program is helping speed up readiness at chinses hospitals and better serve patients  in fact working with kerlanjobe inspired preferus and its partner hospital in china to open the very first comprehensive sports medicine institute in a shanghai public hospital  sports medicine is in growing demand in china so preferus worked with its newly trained chinese doctors to make it a specialty of the local public hospital we talk about globalization sometimes as a bad word as it can threaten jobs and wages  but this is globalization in a good way  if we can tap into the expertise of one group of people to make life better for another that is a good thing franz and his team are seeding the reinvention of the public and private health industry for the chinese market while holding true to chinese values and cultures working with investors and hospital partners in china preferus’s services were so wellreceived that they were eventually asked to manage hospitals across the region at the same time us doctors get a fresh and new perspective from their chinese colleagues and the chance to practice healthcare in a completely different environment the sharing economy has been linked to sharing possessions like cars and houses  but the sharing economy can also be about sharing knowledge that improves lives cooperation between businesses in various countries even with their political counterparts have strained relations are key to gaining understanding innovation and dare i say peace among nations i look forward to my next trip to china to see what this expanding relationship between us and chinese healthcare professionals can achieve for you readers think about how you can create a collaboration with counterparts in unexpected parts of the world to better improve your services thinking products and customer experiences looking under a new rock may be the key to a competitive edge no comments  categories uncategorized what does it take to be a ceo may  0  author admin it had been  days since meeting mr neal dempsey in person at neal’s running start in san francisco and in  days your life can be completely transformed on day  one year ago i was nervously arriving in san francisco having taken the biggest leap of my company’s life  i had committed to spend a month in san francisco under neal dempsey’s mentorship to see if i could take my company to new heights  on that th day i was standing with neal in front of mba students at the university of washington foster school of business sharing my story on how i went from entrepreneur to a ceo of a fastgrowing company with investors fortune  customers and offices in two locations in  days i went from mentee to mentor these students were smart engaged and impressively enough some already had startups underway  we had taken different paths to entrepreneurship  the uw pushes its students to be founders of companies and brings in mentors like neal and the vast successful organizations in the seattle area such as amazon boeing microsoft and starbucks saskatoon is a different story  there aren’t many mentors from big tech companies waiting to offer guidance to saskatoon entrepreneurs and startup companies but whether you come from seattle’s wealth of success or saskatoon’s hard work getitdone work ethic everyone has the same questions – what does it take to be a ceo and run a successful company that’s why i came to help below are a few questions i wanted to highlight from our almost  hour conversation what do you look for in a ceo neal “i look for three things in ceo do they have personality passion and perseverance it’s always a combination of these things never just one” what makes a great company neal “i can tell you all of my best investments have never had a clear straight path to success in fact some of my best investments almost didn’t make it we asked ourselves do we invest more do we shut it down see it’s more like a rollercoaster with ups and downs” how would you suggest building up your leadership team katherine “i have always hired for our biggest pain point at the time in order to improve the team and take that next step i have a sales and marketing background my first hire was our cto romeo genius developer” what do you look for in an investor katherine “i look for a few things but mostly how do they treat people and what experience do they have in our space money is important but both the investor and entrepreneur should walk if it’s not the right fit on other levels” is it lonely being a ceo katherine “what a great question yes yes it totally is however since the neal’s running start program the four of us have been able to create honest relationships where we can go to each other and say  “woah i have no idea how to solve this do you guys” mentorship happens at all levels — with all people” what percentage of ceos can take it all the way neal “you have to understand that running a business is a long and difficult marathon that can go  –  years some of our ceo’s just get tired or what i call “founders fatigue” and don’t want to do it anymore it’s hard i would say only a small percentage of founders can take their startup to an initial liquidity event and that is if they decide they even want too” do you have a number katherine “a phone number sure i haven’t been asked for that in a while just kidding i don’t have a magic number for selling the sky’s the limit and i will worry about it when we get there setting a goal can also be setting a limitation” overall my time at uw was welcoming refreshing and inspiring it was so fascinating watching the students come alive on how they were turning their ideas into a reality this is what makes the business world go round i mentor at the university of washington and in saskatoon with our burgeoning startup community because people like neal were kind enough to help me along the way  i’ve come to learn the value of community like the strong one here at the university of washington  just  days ago i didn’t know the names of the tech startup founders down the hall from me in saskatoon  now we’re a thriving community helping each other learn and grow neal embodies that sense of giving back and community  as i walked the campus i couldn’t help but see dempsey hall and dempsey indoor neal is extremely modest and humble about his success but his presence like his name on the campus buildings is felt and appreciated i’m looking forward to visiting the uw students again and following up on their journey who knows how far they’ll come over the next year  days can change your world no comments  categories uncategorized saskatoon swagger march  0  author admin back in november i wrote about reaching beyond silicon valley link to blog post to encourage innovation in other cities and towns  the next industrial revolution will be all about technology and cities who are not preparing for that may be left behind like we’ve seen in some of the regions who relied too long on outdated manufacturing and energy economies  a couple of weeks ago i visited saskatoon canada to learn more about their burgeoning tech industry and how to support the startups in the area  i attended an event called “flip the switch” which was about turning on the tech industry infrastructure needed to make saskatoon entrepreneurs successful without having to move to silicon valley canada is the fastest growing country in the g and saskatoon is the rd fastest growing city in canada  saskatoon was also named one of three cities to watch for tech job growth in canada  with travel bans and uncertainty in america this year canada has been trying to lure many tech companies to open offices there  most tech companies find vancouver most like silicon valley but like silicon valley it is very expensive  toronto has attracted many companies with its proximity to top universities  but saskatoon is making its mark and i thought it was worth exploring how this city and the province of saskatchewan is working to incentivize tech growth i met with several tech companies in saskatoon and listened to their company pitches their successes and their challenges  i also met with several government officials who were kind enough to provide some of the data and statistics i cited in the above paragraph the biggest difference between silicon valley and any other city or area that wants to grow its tech business is simply the infrastructure  silicon valley lives and breathes tech every day  we have universities vcs entrepreneurs large tech enterprises lawyers marketing people etc who all understand the tech industry  that adds up to a large amount of resources that are completely devoted to helping technology companies grow and thrive and have unprecedented experience  deals get done in coffee shops and at school dropoffs because everyone is in the business  that’s very hard to duplicate therefore what cities like saskatoon need is more tech companies  that is why they had this event  they want to demonstrate that saskatoon and saskatchewan have the people and infrastructure to support growing tech companies that may or may not be true right now but as more tech companies look to set up hubs in canada saskatoon could be worth a look  there are solid universities in the area growing investments and the government is committed to making the area attractive to tech companies  plus the cost of living is very attractive  in the past the region has mostly brought in oil and gas agriculture mining and ranching  these industries are ripe for innovation but there’s also startups in enterprise and consumer software  coconut calendar is a good example  as you recall katherine regnier the ceo of coconut calendar is one of the neal’s running start entrepreneurs and she organized this event to get the tech companies organized  that’s a great start  just getting the support systems talking to each other will go a long way to retaining and attracting new tech companies since my return the potential investment opportunities have been encouraging i have been contacted by a few saskatoon based companies as well as two in calgary they all have early sales traction and in one case multiple millions in revenue all with minimum levels of investment or no outside funding that’s a nod to the hard work and dedication of smalltown people who expect to succeed on their own merits  i’m continuing to investigate these companies and have been happy to receive several other referrals from the saskatchewan government saskatoon has a long way to go before it becomes a new technology hub  but this kind of commitment from the local community businesses universities and the government are exactly what i was talking about in my previous blog  tech innovation is going to have to spread out and saskatoon is a great example of how a city can make a strategic plan to be wellpositioned for the next economy  i look forward to my next visit for more information have a look at a radio and tv interview katherine and i did during my visit httpsaskatoonctvnewscavideoclipidbinidplaylistpagenum httpckomcomarticlelocalstartupwantsignitesasktechindustry no comments  categories uncategorized neal’s running start entrepreneurs offer their top  tips and lessons february  0  author admin last week i had the pleasure of inviting all the neal’s running start entrepreneurs to aspen colorado for a reunion  it’s been a little over a year since these four entrepreneurs from scattered parts of the globe were chosen to be part of the nrs  program  their month with us was a nonstop marathon of lessons on business from silicon valley’s finest  i wanted to see how they’ve applied what they learned since leaving i thought i’d share some of the lessons we talked about as they can apply for any entrepreneur  and they also had some good tips for any entrepreneur who might be facing the same challenges   we’ll start with some lessons they took back applied to their companies and made a big difference top  positive outcomes cash flow – cash is king so master your cash flow management and that will make a huge difference for the survival and growth of the company embrace change – if what you’re doing isn’t working change  if you have to make changes do it fast and decisively raise as much capital as possible – if cash is king so is capital you’ll need it to grow and keep up with the market  don’t worry about taking too much capital as investors will only give you what you need and observe you how stretch to make it work  take capital from multiple sources including vcs angels and government sources if you can the right customers – everyone needs customers but choose the right customers who fit with your longterm vision minimize customizations that can slow down product development the right team – hiring the right team members can take burdens off the ceo and bring new inspiration the wrong hire can be detrimental to the company brand reputation and finances  hire carefully but fire quickly top  challenges cash flow – the inverse of mastering your cash flow is not having the cash flow to master all the entrepreneurs have learned the importance of revenues and if you don’t have cash you must solve that problem first before anything else can happen  have a backup plan or a cushion in case fundraising takes longer than expected product – managing the product direction can prove difficult when you’re being pulled by customers in various directions pick a vision but go where the money is  that’s a hard tightrope to walk managing growth – once you have investment and cash deciding how best to apply it to manage growth is challenging from which hires to make to what rd investments will yield the most results managing growth is complicated making cuts – sometimes you must make the hard call and cut a team member who isn’t working out as the company grows sometimes you must cut people to manage cash flow  but no matter the reason in a small business letting people go is difficult because it’s personal don’t give away the company – at an early stage people will be vying for stock while you need to give some away to get investment and a committed executive team don’t lose your ability to call the shots at this early stage protip one of the entrepreneurs had a tip that everyone liked  make a one page list of your yearly goals  keep it where you can see it every day  that will help everyone manage tough decisions and prioritize activities i’m proud of the entrepreneurs  running a company is never an easy climb  there are always ups and downs  i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again no company i’ve ever worked with has been a straight shot to the top  they all face challenges as they go  our reunion was a chance for us to share the ups and downs of entrepreneurial life and have some fun in the mountains at the same time i’ll continue to keep you posted on our entrepreneurs  we haven’t seen the last of them yet and i look forward to more great times in 0 and beyond   no comments  categories uncategorized tech industry postelection november    author admin what a difference a couple of weeks makes  in my last blog post i talked about how technology presented an opportunity for cities around the world to become innovation hubs  since then we have been through an election cycle in the us  presidentelect donald trump was a surprise win to many and in the postelection analysis the issue of cities leftbehind by the economy has been identified as a key factor in him being the chosen candidate  we need to face the fact that technology has contributed to this economic disparity the technology industry is most proud of the way it “disrupts” industries we have replaced jobs with machines in many industries and continue to do so  technology is expected to upend healthcare education transportation food housing and just about every aspect of daily life  but when we “disrupt” we often destroy  we leave entire careers at the wayside and formerly thriving towns economically devastated now it’s time for tech to disrupt itself and acknowledge the role we are playing in good disruption and bad  we need to put together think tanks on how to replace the jobs we usurp  do we have an obligation to hire a certain percentage of the workforce displaced  robin raskin in her recent huffington post column suggested a tech peace corps to help find solutions to revitalize devastated communities do we have an obligation to create and contribute to a universal income strategy as jobs are lost and not replaced the bottom line is we must start finding solutions to the problems we have created  we must take our fair share of responsibility  our own survival might depend on it because if enough people are left financially devastated by technology’s disruption we can expect more revolution in government like we saw with the donald trump election  we must recognize that while globalization has been great for tech and tech workers it has left others in ruins  it’s time to disrupt that pattern my time with the neal’s running start entrepreneurs opened my eyes to the world of ideas and knowledge that is happening in the most unlikely places like saskatoon canada  we need to support these entrepreneurs and equip cities governments and educators if we’re going to accelerate local economies move struggling cities from outofdate industries that do not offer longterm viability and usher in the next season of economic prosperity for all vcs need to consider social investing in remote places and with people solving third world and first world social and economic problems  we need to look to an unlikely group of entrepreneurs to give us new ideas new perspectives and help us see beyond the next unicorn in the next few months i will be visiting various cities and talking to smart people who are looking to be part of the solution to the economic damage inflicted on our american towns and cities  i will be researching ideas and opportunities  i’ll share my discoveries with you as i go and i look for your input along the way as well if you have ideas to share people you think i should meet places you think i should visit i’m excited to hear from you all  let’s do this together no comments  categories uncategorized that’s a wrap july    author admin it’s been a month now since the neal’s running start gang left san francisco  i’ve started to get back to my normal routines but i miss their energy and the fun times  i’m currently enjoying a trip to london to watch the wimbledon matches and it happens to be canada day so i am reminiscing about my time with the european and one canadian entrepreneur i am compelled  to share a bit of what happened during the inaugural neal’s running start program  but don’t worry because there’s much more to come  we videotaped many of our sessions together so look for a full video series on the neal’s running start experience soon  i think anyone who is trying to make it through a goal or a challenge can take something away from what these entrepreneurs experienced and learned so i hope the video will be a way for everyone to do their own running start program and kickstart an important goal in your life as a runner i will relate their journey to training for a run or a race  everyone starts with the end goal in mind – you’re going to get fit and cross the finish line and be the best runner since usain bolt  for entrepreneurs they start a company with success in mind – they can see it already  they are the next zuckerberg  movies will be made about their ascent and how they changed the world day one  day one o f a run starts out fun and energetic but your dreams of running a marathon on the first day rarely come true  instead day one only serves to show you just how far you have to go and just how out of shape you really are for our entrepreneurs day one was similarly “cometojesusy”  they each had to present their company to a group of investors on day one  but the first day was just like the first day of a run – a metric for how far they really had to go and for some of them how out of shape their companies really were there were inaccuracies and sometimes flat out fiction in their presentations which were too easy to spot and call out  the presentation designs needed work  their whole flow needed work  and truly a presentation is often a reflection of the state of the business itself  so flaws in the presentation reflect real flaws in the underlying business i tried to not be too hard on them and ease them in with gentle critiques  but by day  the gloves were off  we only had 0 days and no time to waste so it was time to throw niceties aside and get to work the next few weeks would prove to be exhausting exhilarating and sometimes brutal  each day had an uphill run on the schedule and like us runners i’m sure they sometimes wanted to dry heave at the top of each hill or sit down and rest for a while  we kept pushing even literally having them dunk themselves in ice cold water for one investor pitch but the oneonone meetings i had with each entrepreneur were where all the exercises and learnings came together  one entrepreneur skirted closer to the death of their company than any entrepreneur wants to come  but through close direction that company turned around and was on track by the end of the 0 days more than one realized they have to move their company  some to silicon valley and some just to where their customers are  but most realized they were going to have to physically move their companies which is not an easy task they all found ways to use their greatest strengths to overcome their greatest challenges  one had a “take no prisoners” approach to getting big things accomplished every day and that helped the entrepreneur almost completely overhaul their business approach during the time in san francisco  another was excellent at networking and took advantage of every conference meeting and connection they could make while in town  yet another was eternally optimistic which i think is a key ingredient for any entrepreneur to persevere through the many obstacles that get in the way of growing a company  and one transformed their stubbornness into an advantage to not give up and dig until they found a solution to the problem rather than allowing fixation to get them stuck on one problem because none of these entrepreneurs had ever spent time in silicon valley they were the most naïve early stage founders i’ve worked with  the lack of mentorship and guidance available in their respective cities really impacted their mindset and how they operated their businesses  therefore each entrepreneur found at least one other mentor besides me who really inspired them or understood their unique market challenges  that is one of the clear advantages of being in silicon valley  not only is there a plethora of wisdom and experience here there’s an unspoken code that you help others  one of the entrepreneurs remarked how willing everyone he asked was to meet and share experience and ideas  whereas in his home country he rarely found mentors with a willingness to be so open and helpful unless you paid them for their time  in silicon valley wisdom flows through friendly meetings at coffee shops offices and the rosewood happy hour  tapping into a braintrust of experience and listening well to what those advisers have to say is a critical ingredient to success all the entrepreneurs walked away with their eyes wide open but now comes the critical part – what they do as they return to their companies away from the silicon valley bubble if you will  i know they are all struggling right now to fight the old inertia and apply the lessons learned so we’ll followup with them soon and check on their progress they all need financing so i’ll be tracking that progress over the next few months but first i want you to get to know each of them and hear for yourselves their unique individual stories and journey through their 0 days in the neal’s running start program  look for our video series in the coming weeks  if you’re looking to start a new goal or tackle a challenge join us for the video series and see if you can take some of the lessons learned and apply them to your own path to success until then here are some photos to give you a taste of the entrepreneurs and their time here no comments  categories uncategorized nourishing silicon valley june    author admin raul lozano has spent his life feeding and nourishing people  from his time as a young person harvesting food in california’s central valley he has been aware of the divide between the fed and the hungry that gap has gotten wider as vegetables especially organic vegetables have gone up in price making healthy food out of reach for many even in silicon valley’s techfueledwealth environment raul founded valley verde to help san jose’s most vulnerable residents have access to healthy organic vegetables his nonprofit organization teaches lowincome families in santa clara county to grow and maintain their own organic vegetable gardens at no cost  the organization is particularly focused on serving immigrant communities  valley verde is the only place where many of these families can find seeds to grow vegetables that are indigenous to their native countries including okra and bok choy valley verde funds this effort by selling gardening kits to individuals and organizations  the organization is also starting to sell some of these organic seedings to other nurseries to raise additional funds  however the need for lowincome families is far outpacing the sales side of the business if you have read any of my posts in the past you know that giving back is a core life value for me  that’s why i’ve been happy and honored to contribute financially to valley verde since its beginnings  i feel strongly about raul’s vision for feeding silicon valley’s people and his savvy in driving a nonprofit organization which isn’t easy in any climate but can be especially challenging in the silicon valley world where most funding goes to forprofit startups  that’s why when our four entrepreneurs from europe were here last month for neal’s running start i made sure to build a day focused on giving back where we invited raul to share some of the things he has learned as a nonprofit founder and leader giving back to the community in whatever way you can is part of being a responsible and contributing human being  some people like raul give their time talents ideas and hard work  some of us like me volunteer time and money to assist the rauls of the world in realizing their vision  what’s most important is that everyone do something to help others and give back  i challenged our four entrepreneurs – katherine antti mario and odie our nickname for neal oddens – to take this lesson back with them and treat it with equal importance to all the business lessons they learned during their stay in silicon valley recently i also challenged raul to raise some additional funds so he can meet the increased number of families his organization helps teach families to learn to become selfsufficient organic gardeners  he raised  in total from other donors like the kellogg and packard foundations i decided to match that  because i am proud of what he’s done and what he is doing to nourish our families in need in silicon valley  but i’d like to see the silicon valley tech industry do more  i’m challenging my colleagues in the vc world entrepreneurs and tech leaders to raise another  for this important cause if you’d like to donate or buy one of his gardening kits to help support valley verde and ensure our vulnerable populations are getting the nourishment they need and deserve please visit his website at wwwvalleyverdeorg a big thank you to raul from all of us at bay partners for the important work he does for our community  we are extremely proud to play our part no comments  categories uncategorized meet antti rikkinen april    author admin many of you know that i started my career in sales  therefore i have a special connection with the sales people of the world  antti rikkinen our third entrepreneur in the neal’s running start program is the founder of zero keyboard and his company is setting out to make life easier for the hardworking neversleeping people in sales zero keyboard is a mobile app that allows people to enter data to salesforce without typing the user simply answers a readymade set of questions with gestures pictures and voice recording  then zero keyboard turns everything into readable explicit information in salesforce  if in my days as a sales rep i could have simply spoke information into my phone and had all my crm information completed i would have probably closed more deals because of the saved time dealing with paperwork and data entry  moreover everyone on my team would have had more comprehensive information about my customer interactions  filling out forms on the road is a real pain for sales people so i saw the appeal of zero keyboard right away while this is antti’s first time as a cofounder of a company he is no stranger to putting himself out there so to speak  if you live in finland you might recognize him from the tv miniseries toisen kanssa  in addition to running a software company antti is also an actor in finland which probably makes him a fantastic sales person as well  we will be filming most of the neal’s running start program and we’re lucky enough to already have a star who is cameraready  this should be fun antti is from helsinki where there has been an emerging tech startup scene recently  in fact we have two entrepreneurs from helsinki in this program  i will be looking for antti to expand his knowledge and experience beyond sales while he’s here  i understand a little bit about that so i’m looking forward to guiding him along that growth path for antti this is an opportunity to make important connections in silicon valley including a partnership or alliance with salesforce “our product is obviously built to serve the salesforce community” said antti  “this opportunity to be so close to the heart of the tech industry including the salesforce headquarters is important to our company  i plan to make the most of the experience and pursue connections at salesforce and beyond while i’m in san francisco and neal’s expertise in my market brings a tremendous learning opportunity” welcome antti twitter rikkinen no comments  categories uncategorized meet mario aguilera march    author admin mario aguilera may currently reside in helsinki but he’s originally from bolivia  he first got the idea for a line of solarpowered backpacks from his days in the bolivian army while training with special forces mario and his unit would spend many days deployed in remote areas  the only reason they had to return to base was to charge their equipment  that’s when he began thinking about wearable technologies that could expand battery life tespack provides a line of designer wearable technology accessories such as backpacks that use solar energy to power devices like laptops and mobile phones  harnessing the natural energy of the sun the tespack wearables provide a continuous power source for devices and is built to withstand rugged outdoors and extreme weather conditions  the company blends fashion with technology and militarygrade endurance designer wearable tech is something new for me but i found mario’s idea fascinating and certainly practical my personal interest in this product is my ability to get lost on long trail runs or overnight hikes and have a wearable technology product keep my gear charged and ready to go this product clearly presents an opportunity for large consumer markets as a limited partner of true ventures who are the largest investors in fitbit this is an area i’m watching closely mario has plenty of background in the clothing industry to support the sleek design of his products  we may both be learning a few new things together but i think the challenge for mario will be focusing his growth potential when there are so many directions he could take this company  that is a challenge i understand well and i look forward to helping him make some smart growth decisions to push forward his smart wearables mario already has a seed round of funding  this trip will help him expand his contacts for the next round as well as make some important contacts in the manufacturing sector and in consumer products and retail sales here in silicon valley “tespack has experienced rapid growth internationally and with that growth comes big challenges such as manufacturing design and distribution channels” said mario “this opportunity comes at just the right time for my company and i’m looking forward to highimpact learning with neal on how to manage a highgrowth consumer company” welcome mario twitter aguileramario no comments  categories
