across middle tennessee keep their finances in order and plan for the future  stay tuned for the formal announcement and article hey millennials for the best of life’s experiences mix strategy with spontaneity june  newscapwealth the following column from jennifer pagliara capwealth senior advisor appeared in the tennessean on june   read it at the tennessean here getty imageshero images how many times would you go see your favorite musical performer or band five ten twenty times one of my friends traveled to dc this weekend to see dave matthews for the th time while he was there he also caught the u show a group he’s now seen seven times when he told me this last week i was amazed then listening to the radio on my way to work the very next day the deejays asked their listeners to call in and talk about what band or singer they’d seen the most a woman called in claiming she had seen widespread panic 0 times widespread panic my jaw literally dropped that’s an enormous commitment of time and money and the woman was only  years old the media loves to talk about how much my generation the millennials values experiences over physical possessions but this was revelatory for me as i drove down the highway i confess to experiencing some widespread panic myself i love concerts just as much as the next person — provided that person isn’t this woman i have definitely seen some of my favorite bands and performers more than once there’s just not enough music fanaticism and too much responsible financial adviser in me to see anyone 0 times the cost of a concert experience it’s one thing to see a show in the city in which you live but something else altogether if you have to travel let’s put some numbers around going on an overnight trip to see a concert in another city concert ticket according to a report by pollstar the average cost of a ticket in  was  obviously this is going to vary depending on who you see and if you’re getting the ticket at face value or rebuying through a service like stubhub   plane ticket according to the bureau of transportation statistics last year the average domestic us ticket price was    lodging the average hotel price in  was around    food  alcohol while you’re traveling you’re going to have to eat out and alcohol at the concert venue isn’t going to be cheap let’s be on the conservative side and say you spend a total of   transportation don’t forget the rides to and from the airport going to eat and getting to and from the concert let’s add in another 0 which again is conservative the total spend on this twodayandonenight experience  multiply that by 0 and you’ve got 0 let that sink in a moment deferring today’s pleasure for more tomorrow now think in terms of retirement — which is how i instantly thought of it when i heard her on the radio let’s say a yearold put that total in an investment account today how much money would that be when that person is  assuming an annual  percent return on her investment which is the average annual return of the sp  adjusted for inflation and accounting for dividends since 0 her account would be worth north of  million learn how that happens in another of my columns a million bucks my dear fellow millennials can buy a lot of experiences the original  grand could provide a sizeable down payment on a house it could launch a business the possibilities are endless mix strategy into your spontaneity i don’t mean to moralize for all i know the woman on the radio is prudently saving and investing and like her i too believe in experiences after all what is life but a long hopefully and in the main satisfying again hopefully sequence of experiences but i’m a firm believer that not only whims but planning and discipline too achieve invaluable experiences freedom from financial worry the resources to maintain an enjoyable lifestyle and take memorable trips the ability to send children to college security in retirement and much much more americans now spend more at restaurants than grocery stores is it a problem june  newscapwealth the following column from phoebe venable capwealth advisors president  coo appeared in the tennessean on june   recently i heard our chief investment strategist say that americans now spend more at restaurants than grocery stores i was astonished could that really be true a couple quick google searches confirmed that indeed last year retail sales at restaurants and bars exceeded those of grocery stores for the first time it’s norman rockwell at my house my next thought was well the rest of country might be eating out more but not so at my house we’re very committed to having dinner as a family each night plus i have a passion for cooking in fact our sacred mealtime ritual a tradition carried over from my childhood is quaint to many of our friends i look forward to the conversation i look forward to the connection i look forward to seeing my husband and my son enjoying the repast i’ve prepared with my own two hands yet being a finance and numbers freak i was curious what was our ratio of eating at home versus eating out so i separated out our grocery and restaurant purchases over the past year you guessed it i was stupefied to discover that we too spent more at restaurants what happened to my norman rockwell dinnertime a buffet of dining options there are several reasons behind this reversal of a longstanding pattern in which the bulk of american food spending occurs at the supermarket demographics have had a large impact on this shift while baby boomers are eating at home in an effort to save money perhaps because they undersaved for retirement they are outnumbered by the millennial generation millennials have many frugal habits but they do have a penchant for eating out technology is also impacting the trend with apps like grubhub doordash and seamless providing convenient ways to order food from almost any restaurant for delivery takeout has become so popular that restaurants are being reconfigured to handle the growing number of customers that come in only to pick up their order somewhere between a homecooked meal and eating out is the meal kit another new dining phenomenon meal kits offer preportioned ingredients and instructions for preparation delivered direct to your doorstep they require cooking but there is no actual grocery shopping blue apron hellofresh and plated are all examples of an industry which is touting annual sales of  billion and growing is this trend a problem it depends is this trend a problem for the american consumer dining out is certainly more expensive than eating at home but if you’re adjusting your budget to accommodate then it shouldn’t be a big deal but the federal reserve’s  report on the economic wellbeing of us households showed that  percent of adults say they either could not cover an emergency expense costing  a couple of weeks ago an australian real estate mogul was roundly lambasted on social media for suggesting that  avocado toast might be why millennials couldn’t afford homes but the truth is eating out does add up one wonders too if it’s adding up in other ways — contributing to our escalating obesity epidemic for instance it’s certainly not a problem for investors it’s an opportunity when consumers change their preferences they shift spending habits causing some companies to benefit and others to suffer winners and losers can be hard to identify but if you think this trend is here to stay investing in companies that adapt to the changes in their industry could bring

corker’s pointer investment profited him a total of between  million and  million over the next nine years corker’s own investments in hedge funds betting on fannie and freddie’s failure provide a

expected to be dominant players in the future housing finance industry before starting his latest assignment with breitbartcom corker media stooge john carney even took pains to disguise his years of

fannie and freddie were seized in the fall of 0 more than  major lenders more than  major lenders in the subprime mortgage market had failed including financial institutions that provided warehouse

task for his “bankcentric” view that no commercial bank had failed while performing proprietary trading arguing that corker “must have received his information from the banking lobby and did not do

investing heavily in hedge funds including one known to have shorted fannie and freddie in 0 while demonizing hedge funds for wanting to make a profit on their gse stock “the hedge fund attacks are a sideshow to avoid scrutiny of corker’s own proposals which would turn over the us housing market to wells fargo” rosner said “corker has this amazing way of creating false villains to avoid the substance of real mortgage market reform” rosner continued “making the argument all about ‘evil hedge funds’ captures the public attention and may sound right to those less knowledgeable about the importance of capital investment to the growth and development of the mortgage market in the united states” he insisted “but the truth is that demonizing hedge funds is nothing more than a

the fact that the obama administration unilaterally changed the terms of the gse conservatorship to sweep all their profits is irrefutable it’s also clear that the administration did so just as the gses were becoming fantastically profitable again this too is a matter of public record thanks to ongoing litigation in more than one courtroom what’s not always plain is what the administration did with those coffers swelling with illbegotten riches the article below click here to read the original publication compellingly alleges that one of the ways the gse profits–our profits by rights–were used was by illegally funding obama’s signature work as president the affordable care act i encourage fannie and freddie shareholders as well as anyone interested in citizens’ rights and the rule of law to read it obama illegally robbed fannie freddie to fund obamacare obama diverted money from lowincome housing to keep obamacare alive jerome r corsi  infowarscom – february   washington dc – will this be the final nail in the coffin for the affordable care act commonly known as “obamacare” federal court litigation provides evidence the obama administration illegally diverted taxpayer funds that had not been appropriated by congress in an unconstitutional scheme to keep obamacare from imploding in  a us district judge caught the obama administration’s health and human services department acting unconstitutionally and therefore put an end to the illegal diversion of taxpayer funds but the obama administration didn’t stop there the obama administration instead turned to the nation’s two governmentsponsored mortgage giants – the federal national mortgage association commonly known as “fannie mae” and the federal home loan mortgage corporation commonly known as “freddie mac” – to invent a new diversion of funds in a desperate attempt to keep obamacare from collapsing a key date is may   that was the day when us district judge rosemary collyer in the case us house of representatives v burwell  f supp d  us district court for the district of columbia ruled against health and human services secretary sylvia matthews burwell judge collyer decided hhs secretary burwell had no constitutional authority to divert funds congress appropriated to one section of the aca to fund obamacare subsidy payments to insurers under another section of the aca section 0 – the clause defining the insurer subsidies – when congress specifically declined to appropriate any funds to section 0 for paying the insurance subsidy “paying out section 0 reimbursements without an appropriation thus violates the constitution” judge collyer concluded “congress authorized reduced cost sharing but did not appropriate monies for it in the fiscal year  budget or since” “congress is the only source for such an appropriation and no public money can be spent without one” the us district court in this ruling entered judgment in favor of the house of representatives barring hhs from using unappropriated money to pay insurers under section 0 what was at issue in section 0 was the obamacare provision that capped the amount of federal subsidies under section 0 that lowerincome families could use to pay for insurance purchased on state insurance exchanges particularly the difference between the capped maximum based on a person or family’s income in relation to the federal poverty level congress had refused to pass an appropriation to fund section 0 – the section of the aca that called for making the insurance subsidy payments in a report issued in march  the congressional budget office estimated the cost for providing section 0 subsidies over the next ten years  was estimated to be  billion forbidden by judge collyer’s decision from diverting money congress appropriated for other aca provisions to pay section 0 subsidies the obama administration faced the prospect that the government could not pay subsidies to permit lowerincome persons and families to buy the amount of health insurance obamacare was written to provide them either this or insurers would be forced to charge middle and high incomepersons and families such outrageous amounts for their insurance coverage to subsidize the poor under aca that only the wealthiest could afford to buy health insurance in other words obamacare was dead in the water if the obama administration could not find a way to circumvent the district court’s decision us house of representatives v burwell to fund section 0 despite the fact congress had refused to do so determined to keep obamacare alive the obama administration decided to find a way around judge collyer’s ruling the fix involved the obama administration redefining the terms of the 0 conservatorship agreements which advanced funds to fannie mae and freddie mac from a 0 dividend on moneys borrowed to the federal government’s confiscation of  of the future and imminent profits of these government sponsored entities or gses miraculously the freddie and fannie “pot of gold” turned out to be almost exactly the amount the obama administration needed to meet the anticipated insurance company subsidies required to keep section 0 in business so how did fannie and freddie get this pot of gold given that only a few years earlier both gses were bankrupt in 0 in the midst of the financial crisis caused in part by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market the federal government decided to seize fannie mae and freddie mac which at the time were two shareholderowned companies in passing the housing and economic recovery act of 0 hera the us congress had fixed the regulatory issues at fannie mae and freddie mac creating a mechanism for them to be placed into conservatorship at federal government’s discretion and providing up to  billion in funds that could be advanced to the gses through a purchase of senior preferred stock paying a ten percent dividend in deciding to bail them out the federal government took control of the two giant mortgage gses with fannie and freddie effectively put into government “conservatorship” as part of the conservatorship the federal government effectively acquired warrants convertible at a nominal price which allowed the federal government to acquire  of the gse’s common stock this resulted in causing dilution in the percentage of fannie and freddie common stock ownership that was left in the hands of private and institutional investors congress’ intent was that fannie mae and freddie mac would pay back the treasury as the mortgage giants returned to profitability but after the treasury was paid back the terms of hera anticipated fannie mae and freddie mac would pay appropriate dividends to stockholders including the federal government leaving enough funds within freddie and fannie to “conserve and preserve” the assets of the two gses anticipating their eventual return to a “safe and solvent” operating condition in  the obama administration unilaterally decided to change the terms of hera by sweeping all the profits of fannie and freddie into the treasury’s general fund the obama administration took this action the socalled “net worth sweep” without any congressional authority to do so the result was that the us treasury “found” a way to sweep  of fannie and freddie profits into the treasury’s “general fund” leaving the giant mortgage gses vulnerable to the need for another government bailout should another disruption occur in the nation’s economy because of this decision the obama administration on its own authority simply decided to discontinue paying dividends to private and institutional owners of fannie and freddie common and preferred stock congress in passing hera never anticipated the obama administration would take over fannie and freddie and strip the agencies of all profits – a move that left private and institutional shareholders in the cold leading up to the decision to sweep fannie and freddie’s profits the gses return to imminent profitability was known only by a few government officials and their consultants their own internal forecasts uncovered in unsealed court documents showed that fannie and freddie’s profitability would soon dramatically outperform the amount of the allowable 0 dividend that the treasury would receive under the existing senior preferred stock purchase agreements on august   these same officials and consultants succeeded in engineering with the federal housing financial agency fhfa and the department of treasury an amendment to the senior preferred stock purchase agreements that allowed the us treasury to grab all fannie and freddie profits – regardless how large fannie and freddie’s earnings might be between  when the obama administration began its policy of confiscating all fannie and freddie profits and now fannie and freddie have paid the us treasury general fund more than  billion in dividends the point is that after may   when us district judge rosemary collyer ruled that hhs had to stop diverting aca funds to pay obamacare subsidies the obama administration realized that hhs somehow had to fund the estimated  billion the hhs would need in un‐appropriated monies to pay health insurers the aca subsidies required to keep obamacare alive in fiscal year  plaintiffs litigating against the obama administration’s confiscation of freddie and fannie earnings have challenged in court whether the obama administration’s decision to amend the preferred stock purchase agreement in august  and sweep gse profits of  billion in   billion from fannie mae and  billion from freddie mac was an attempt to circumvent congress on the single most important policy priority of the white house the timing was particularly interesting given that september  marked the beginning of the sequestration discussions government documents leave little doubt profits from fannie and freddie confiscated by the us treasury have been used by the obama administration to pay obamacare subsidies and other items not appropriated by congress in complete and illegal circumvention of the district court’s ruling and the constitution’s determination that only the congress shall have the power to tax and spend for instance chapter  of the congressional budget office publication “the budget and economic outlook  to ” notes on page  that the major contributors to mandatory us government spending include “… outlays for medicaid subsidies for health insurance purchases through exchanges and the government’s transactions with fannie mae and freddie mac” why fannie and freddie are specified in this context when fannie and freddie have had sufficient earnings to operate without government subsidies since 0 is made clear a few pages later on page  in table  the cbo report notes “mandatory outlays projected in cbo’s baseline” from fannie mae and freddie mac for  is  billion and for  a total of  billion the figures are “negative dollar amounts” because instead of paying out to freddie and fannie the us treasury is collecting from freddie and fannie with the proceeds going into the us treasury general fund to pay “mandatory outlays” including evidently continued subsidies to insurers as specified by aca section 0 in footnote  on page  of that cbo report lets the cat out of the bag noting the obama administration considers payments from freddie and fannie “to be outside of the federal government for budgetary purposes” recording cash payments from freddie and fannie to the treasury as “federal receipts” the obama administration evidently considered this alltooconvenient redefinition of terms allowed the government to argue the use of fannie and freddie profits to pay obamacare section 0 subsidies was not in violation of the district court ruling why evidently because fannie and freddie profits were not taxpayergenerated but were profit payments generated by government sponsored entities that still had some common and preferred stock private and institutional shareholder ownership in the same footnote the cbo takes exception with the obama administration commenting the cbo considers profit payments to the treasury made by fannie and freddie to be “intragovernmental” receipts going into the same treasury general fund pot to be mixed indistinguishably with taxpayer revenue not distinct publicprivate gse “receipts” separately accounted for in the treasury general fund as distinguishable from taxpayer revenue if the federal courts conclude fannie and freddie gse “receipts” to treasury still need congressional appropriation to be spent legitimately by the executive branch of government the obama administration will have been exposed as having operated outside the constitution in its desperate attempt to keep the aca from imploding what should be outrageous to progressives understanding the obama administration subterfuge to keep the aca alive is that by confiscating fanniefreddie profits to keep obamacare alive obama ignored core members of the democratic party’s core constituency – affordable housing advocates and minority groups – with little

have been abused by the gse conservatorship for both of these reasons i invite you to read his latest letter to shareholders and directors of his fairholme fund january   to the shareholders and directors of fairholme fund trades portfolios inc since fairholme’s inception we have pursued a valueoriented investment approach that avoids popular securities in favor of companies that are both unloved and undervalued although the world has become more uncertain and the recognition of value is taking longer we remain optimistic business cycles exist history continues to rhyme investors march to the drums of both greed and fear markets move with asset values but not always since  our letters have tried to explain how we assay fundamental values and assess the differences between such values and their market prices our goal remains to buy dollars for fifty cents or less technological disintermediation and regulatory overreach have increasingly affected investment conditions including the supply of and demand for human and capital resources fairholme’s investment checklist has necessarily adapted to these and other evolving dynamics continuous review of risks and returns resulted in transitioning the fairholme mutual funds collectively the “funds” from common equities toward shorter term higher yielding and more senior debt obligations and reduced exposure to financials that may lose more than can be gained amid higher interest rates over the coming years our investments have significantly less correlation with equity market indices we believe that the funds have the wherewithal for outsized rewards while protecting against the inevitable headwinds caused by rising interest rates and high valuation levels exchangetraded index funds “etfs” are all the rage these days for their straightforward lowcost replication of broad indexes while it is a good idea to efficiently go long america etfs occasionally swing to illogical extremes when popularity leads to overpriced and overweighted constituents when bubbles burst it may take a decade or longer to recover what may be lost in a few months given the choice we strongly prefer to focus on the unpopular underpriced and underweighted we recall charlie munger trades portfolio’s advice students learn corporate finance at business schools they are taught that the whole secret is diversification but the rule is exactly the opposite the ‘knownothing’ investor should practice diversification but it is crazy if you are an expert the goal of investment is to find situations where it is safe not to diversify if you only put  into the opportunity of a lifetime you are not being rational very seldom do we get to buy as much of any good idea as we would like to fannie mae and freddie mac odds favor fannie mae fnma or freddie mac fmcc helped your parents and you obtain a first home and that the same will be true for your children and grandchildren fannie mae and freddie mac guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest demanded by lenders investors just like you own and fund their operations yet we fight an expropriation of our principal by the government here’s where we stand prosperity exists in a capitalist society only when contracts are honored the rule of law must be respected and cannot be eliminated by fiat if you disagree just see the despair in venezuela we look forward to a decision from the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that protects and preserves our investments in fannie mae and freddie mac signs indicate that we are nearing the end of our “alice in washington” journey our three appellate court judges janice brown doug ginsburg and patricia millett published a separate decision heartland plymouth court mi llc v national labor relations board that we believe is instructive to their eventual ruling in our case writing for the majority judge brown stated as this case shows what the national labor relations board “nlrb” proffers as a sophisticated tool towards national uniformity can just as easily be an instrument of oppression allowing the government to tell its citizens “we don’t care what the law says if you want to beat us you will have to fight us” … we recognize the nlrb’s unimpeded access to the public fisc means these modest fees can be dismissed as chump change but money does not explain the board’s bad faith “the pleasure of being above the rest” does see cs lewis mere christianity  harper collins 0 let the word go forth for however much the judiciary has emboldened the administrative state we “say what the law is” marbury  us  cranch at  in other words administrative hubris does not get the last word under our constitution and citizens can count on it in another decision directv inc v national labor relations board judge brown was even more direct about the perils of unchecked executive action when she noted that “judicial review should mean more than batting cleanup for the administrative state” if applied in equal measure these sentiments bode well for our case finding no clear reason in favor of extraordinary secrecy us court of federal claims judge margaret sweeney fairholme fund trades portfolios v united states no cvmms recognized that the government’s attempt to hide thousands of documents is unjustifiable for the work of our government must withstand public scrutiny judge sweeney issued a court order directing the obama administration to produce scores of documents that were improperly withheld based on assertions of deliberative process privilege bank examiner privilege and presidential communications privilege her decision was largely upheld upon review by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in due course we expect further proof that obama administration officials violated laws established by our founding fathers to prevent such unfettered discretion alexander hamilton said it best the nature of the contract in its origin is that the public will pay the sum expected in the security to the first holder or his assignee the intent in making the security assignable is that the proprietor may be able to make use of his property by selling it for as much as it may be worth in the market and that the buyer may be safe in the purchase every buyer therefore stands exactly in the place of the seller has the same right with him to the identical sum expressed in the security and having acquired the right by fair purchase and in conformity to the original agreement and intention of the government his claim cannot be disputed without manifest injustice we are frequently asked i why we own the preferred stock of fannie mae and freddie mac instead of common shares and ii how this story ends our answers are simple the provisions of the preferred stock contracts that we own provide us with greater security and certainty than the common stock and as you know we are not speculators in this instance we have invested in two superb insurance companies with unparalleled brand recognition talented human capital proprietary information technology infrastructure and robust industry relationships fannie mae and freddie mac are quintessential examples of what warren buffett trades portfolios would describe as “economic castles protected by unbreachable moats” as interest rates rise fannie mae’s and freddie mac’s portfolios become even more valuable – and we anticipate that q  results will reflect this positive impact allow me to emphasize a few points that you may have heard before any intellectually honest observer would proffer that the rational steps for resolution are i halt the payment of any further monies to the united states treasury ii permit the companies to retain capital in order to protect taxpayers iii transform the companies into lowrisk public utilities with regulated rates of return just like your local electric company and iv eventually release them from the shackles of a perpetual conservatorship so they can help more low and moderateincome families move up the economic ladder only the disingenuous would assert that recapitalization of these companies would take decades and come at taxpayers’ expense as if retaining earnings precluded the ability of each company to raise equity from private investors only those beholden to special interests would ignore the substantial reforms implemented at fannie mae and freddie mac over the last eight years and pretend the companies are somehow doomed to repeat the past upon release from conservatorship and only those who oppose the dream of homeownership for america’s middle class would attempt to dismantle two publicly traded shareholderowned companies that have singlehandedly provided over  trillion in liquidity to support our mortgage market since 0 we are optimistic that the indispensability of fannie mae and freddie mac to affordable homeownership eventually overpowers the taboo imposed upon them by the

appeared in the tennessean on january   every year my firm hosts “money camp” for our clients’ children and grandchildren we believe that even young children can and should learn the basics of spending saving investing and charitable giving but there are other critical lessons that only a parent can teach their children lessons in confidence selfreliance perseverance inquisitiveness kindness and hard work lessons that not only forge character but could have a direct correlation one day to your adult child’s personal and professional success  master the handshake in the movie “my life” michael keaton’s character is dying of cancer and decides to film advice for his unborn child one memorable scene is his demonstration of how to properly shake hands it’s big bold funny — and spoton our children boys and girls need the confidence to make and keep eye contact when they meet other people and to give a firm handshake as social psychologist amy cuddy explains in one of the most popular ted talks of all time our body language can change not only other people’s perceptions of us but even our own brain’s testosterone and cortisol levels — which too can impact success  get a job nothing teaches the value of hard work quite like — you got it — hard work whether it’s a parttime job a summer job andor responsibilities at home children will learn essential life lessons through work that monetary reward requires labor and with that labor also comes other rewards — a welldeserved sense of accomplishment for instance additionally time and project management goal setting teamwork punctuality and more  hone communication skills we live in a world of powerful omnipresent communication devices knowing how to use those is important knowing how to speak and write well are still indispensable to explaining selling inspiring and leading parents make sure your children are learning to present their ideas and address groups in school if your kid is selling candy or magazines to neighbors for a school fundraiser or peddling their lawnmowing services help them concoct a polite persuasive pitch make sure they can compose clear cogent complete sentences jargon shorthand and emoticons don’t cut it in the business world a surefire way to improve communication skills read books  cultivate curiosity encourage children to ask questions when they ask questions about the world they’ll learn often by being compelled to go find answers for themselves hopefully they’ll also learn to listen care more and understand what motivates people that’s becoming smarter and more human and people like that go far in life  know how to change a tire it’s not only a practically useful skill for the day your child has a flat but it will help instill in your children selfsufficiency to look for solutions when the unexpected arises to feel equal to a challenge to think and act under pressure to understand that doing something yourself is often more effective efficient and satisfactory than outsourcing it to others  volunteer there’s more to life than work and play there are great causes for improving the world as well as other people often less fortunate that need our help “no man is an island” wrote the poet john donne we’re all a piece of a larger continent — be it a family a neighborhood a community a nation or the world get your children involved through scouting church or organizations such as hands on nashville or second harvest food bank helping others will expand your child’s mind and heart  acquire some financial grounding there is a financial component to nearly every endeavor including any business running a household and planning for retirement ensure your children understand the basics before they graduate high school income expenses profits interest inflation return risk liquidity and the time value of money to name a few phoebe venable chartered financial analyst is president and coo of capwealth advisors llc her column
