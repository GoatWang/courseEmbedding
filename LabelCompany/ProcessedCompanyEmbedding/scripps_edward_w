regard my lifes greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the united press to provide competition to the associated presscitation needed scripps believed in editorial independence stating a newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class the advertisers

half brother john mogg scripps half brother about e w scripps httpenwikipediaorgwikiewscripps edward willis scripps june   – march   was an american newspaper publisher and founder of the e w scripps company a diversified media conglomerate and united press news service it became united press international upi when international news service merged with united press in  the e w scripps school of journalism at ohio university is named for him early life e w scripps was born and raised in rushville illinois to james mogg scripps from london and julia adeline osborne third wife    from new york e w was the youngest of five children born to james and julia james had seven children from previous marriages e w as with many businessmen of his day went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name his middle name is often incorrectly written as wyllis newspaper career both e w and his halfsister ellen worked with his older halfbrother james when he founded the detroit news in  e w started as an office boy at the paper in  with loans from his halfbrothers e w went on to found the penny press later the cleveland press in cleveland with financial support from sister ellen he went on to begin or acquire some  newspapers this was the beginning of a media empire that is now the e w scripps company e w would lend money to promising young local newspaper publishers and buy the successful one having  share of the paper once bought he did not sell out but held on to the paper a guiding tenet of e w was that local editors know best about running local newspapers editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy among the innovations e w made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and with his brother james of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers in  scripps created united press associations later the upi news service from smaller regional news services scripps later said i regard my lifes greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the united press to provide competition to the associated press scripps held a relatively unconventional view of the press stating a newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class the advertisers which furnishes the larger part of a newspapers income it must occasionally so antagonize this class as to cause it not only to cease patronage to a greater or lesser extent but to make actually offensive warfare against the newspaper later life in  he finished building a home in san diego where his halfsister lived nearby thinking that the dry warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life he built it as a winter home to escape the cold of illinois but eventually lived there year round and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch his ranch encompassed what is today the community of scripps ranch as well as marine corps air station miramar in  he and his halfsister ellen were the founding donors of the scripps institution of oceanography initially scripps was reluctant to support the venture thinking scientists could not be businesslike however he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director william emerson ritter and together they began to plan projects for the institute as the institute started to succeed he became an enthusiastic supporter and took a great interest in its work in  scripps founded science service later renamed society for science  the public with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements the organization continues to run as a nonprofit dedicated to the promotion of science scripps became somewhat of a hermit calling himself a damned old crank he enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht smoking  cigars a day scripps died at the age of  on march   among his descendants was samuel h scripps  –  grandson who became

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
