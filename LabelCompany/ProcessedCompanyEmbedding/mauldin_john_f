site already a subscriber  login here this week in geopolitics  years since the marshall plan by george friedman and jacob l shapiro june   seventy years ago on june  us secretary of state george marshall gave a speech at harvard university few speeches in modern times have had as much geopolitical consequence in just eight paragraphs marshall made the case for significant us involvement in europe’s economic reconstruction after world war ii within  months the united states passed the foreign assistance act of  better known as the marshall plan it provided over  billion to  european countries approximately  billion in  dollars according to the congressional research service the annual appropriation in  alone accounted for  of the entire us federal budget the marshall plan became a significant instrument of american power it represented a substantial sacrifice for the us but one that paid dividends long after the us stopped providing funds to marshall plan recipients at a time when the world is divided on the merits of nationalism versus internationalism it’s worth reflecting on why the marshall plan worked strategy not charity marshall made two key points in his speech to harvard graduates the first was the call for the rise of technocracy marshall said rebuilding europe was a task of such “enormous complexity” that it had become difficult for “the man in the street” to make sense of the situation and what had to be done his second point was that rebuilding europe was in the united states’ economic interest the return of “normal economic health in the world” was the precondition for political stability and peace it couldn’t be offered piecemeal it had to be backed by the full faith of the us government in effect marshall announced that the us was open for business european countries heard the message and lined up click to enlarge by economic indicators the marshall plan was a success according to the congressional research service by the end of  industrial production for participating countries had increased by  and gross national product had risen by  european countries set up entities like the organization for european economic cooperation which would later become the oecd and the european coal and steel community the forerunner of the european union but more important were the steps taken toward greater western european integration as marshall said in his speech at stake was a fundamental us interest political stability and peace on the european continent the marshall plan was not american charity it was us strategy rebuilding europe with us dollars and remaking it more in america’s image was the tactic the us used to achieve the strategic end of limiting the spread of soviet power   this was the heyday of what is now called liberal internationalism a doctrine that argues for the intervention of international institutions to promote liberal values the marshall plan is just one manifestation of the types of policies associated with liberal internationalism the doctrine is most famously embodied in the united nations nato and the european union these are massive wellknown institutions—the faces really of liberal internationalism—but it shouldn’t be forgotten that they are made up of individual nations the united nations was formed on the basis of the national sovereignty of its member states this was the compromise embedded in the institutions the liberal internationalists created global bodies that used national power to promote liberalism throughout the world the afterglow but bureaucracy has a way of taking on a life of its own after the fall of the soviet union some international institutions saw an opportunity to take integration further that the cold war had been won seemed to validate their legitimacy there was however another interpretation that the soviet collapse meant the mission had been accomplished and that the extraordinary circumstances that had defined the postworld war ii world were no more the international institutions had served their purpose and the world could finally return to statetostate relations rather than concerning itself with alliances against a potential enemy    these competing conceptions are straining the institutions that liberal internationalism dreamed up us president donald trump’s decision to withdraw the united states from the paris climate agreement has dominated headlines in recent days before that german chancellor angela merkel suggested that germany and by extension europe could no longer rely on the united states meanwhile the disparate interests of eu member states have grown beyond brussels’ ability to harmonize them this is not an unprecedented moment or a sign of the apocalypse it’s the return of history the us and germany have different interests europe is a diverse continent of many different nations and has never been united under one banner the us has resumed its traditional wariness of international agreements and suspicion of international obligations there is no europe to rebuild and there is no enemy to defeat if george marshall were speaking at harvard’s  commencement he would be unable to find an issue to discuss that is as dire today as the need to reconstruct europe was in  there is no single issue today that requires america’s undivided attention but rather several smaller issues that require america to divide its attention after world war ii europe was beset with problems in search of solutions it found the solutions in collaboration through newly minted international institutions but these institutions have become solutions in search of problems on this june  then it is useful to consider what made the marshall plan so successful it was rooted in the national interests of all the countries involved its goals were clearly articulated its strategic interests were readily apparent its administration was focused and its implementation well defined there were mechanisms for accountability and enforcement these are the things that must be considered when evaluating the strength and viability of an international institution or agreement in the future george

reserve bank richard is simply one of the most entertaining and informative thinkers i know i cherish his thoughts and the alltoobrief times i get to be with him he is the source of a thousand stories and you always learn something new in this speech he makes all the points i just made in last week’s letter – in spades right off the top we learn – and here’s something i didn’t know – that richard was conceived in shanghai in  and smuggled out in his mama’s tummy on the secondtolast ship to leave shanghai before mao’s forces closed the ports next there’s a remarkable vignette featuring lara croft as played by angelina jolie in the film version of tom clancy’s hunt for red october thor’s hammer “considered the most awesome weapon in norse mythology” and the  dedicated members of norway’s special forces who used to track soviet submarines on jan meyen island six hundred miles west of norway – all this just by way of richard’s warning his audience that he’s about to do his darnedest to explain “why in the world in which we live today what we are used to working doesn’t and why nobody seems to understand why” that’s a lot to bite off but this is a guy who was a persistent and eloquent contrarian during his time on the federal open market committee in  he was sounding the alarm loud and clear on the imminent subprime crisis while his colleagues slumbered in  he took on bernanke  friends in outspoken opposition to their unholy love of quantitative easing today’s otb is vintage fisher in part a heartfelt endorsement of the real change in washington and the country that the trump administration is trying to effect there is frequent mention of an “orange swan” and in equal part a strong caution against “withdrawing from rather than improving the present world order” but as richard reminds us after churchill “americans always do the right thing – after they have tried everything else” so dig in and enjoy an unbridled romp with richard fisher through the forever intertangled worlds of politics and economics and dear gods i hope this man is our next fed chairman i find myself in the delta club in minneapolis for a longish layover waiting to get to san francisco and palo alto tonight burmese food with andy kessler and rich karlgarrd and dissecting the future is about as good as it gets then to bed early and up again for solid meetings fortuitously

orange swans halfwits phil gramm ken arrow mexico churchill tugofwar marcus nadler and secretariat by richard fisher april   the phoenician resort scottsdale az thank you david pothast i did indeed come straight from beijing and admit to being jet lagged though this great resort and the hospitality you and your association have shown me is a very nice way to recover here is a little known fact i have been going to china since  how could that be well my parents were on the secondtolast ship to leave shanghai the ss president wilson before mao’s forces closed the ports they had been living in the peace hotel while my dad was on business there i was born six months later in los angeles so like so many things we have here in the us i was manufactured in china now to more serious things six hundred miles west of norway there is a communications station on jan meyen island where  hearty members of norway’s special forces tracked soviet submarines if you read tom clancy’s hunt for red october you would know it as “loran c” if you played the video game tomb raider you would recall that lara croft – played by angelina jolie in the film version – visits jan meyen in search of thor’s hammer considered the most awesome weapon in norse mythology capable of leveling mountains and performing the most heroic of feats when you arrive on the island you are greeted with this sign translated it reads theory is when you understand everything but nothing works practice is when everything works but nobody understands why at this station theory and practice are united nothing works and nobody understands why  jim  whitman asked me to speak to you this morning to try to explain why in the world in which we live today what we are used to working doesn’t and why nobody seems to understand why  i will give it my best shot “you look like i need a drink” let’s start with politics the political scene has changed enormously since i received the invitation from jim to speak to you today then it was a given that hillary clinton would become the th president of the united states and that fiscal regulatory and government policy would follow conventional form in what was a shock to some but not to this speaker donald trump was elected on the premise that he would “drain the swamp” in washington and turn the tables on the status quo this has engendered enormous angst among those who had banked on business as usual and great hope among those who worried that the magnificent machine that is the us economy has been in decline the former group those accustomed to the intoxicating ambrosia of the status quo regard president trump with a reaction not unlike that of country singer justin moore’s title song “you look like i need a drink” the “orange swan” and “halfwits” the latter especially sober business leaders financiers and market operators have turned the term “black swan” on its head in the parlance of finance a “black swan” is an unforeseen event that shocks the market place and leads to severe negative reaction business operators looked at the president’s agenda of deregulation pledges of tax cuts and reform his cabinet appointments and supreme court nominee and his general disposition toward curbing the intrusion of government on freedom of the “animal spirits” and saw what i will call in deference to the candidate trump’s then hair color an “orange swan” – a welcome surprise to the upside i’ll put this in perspective with my favorite story told by ronald reagan during the  presidential campaign president reagan came to dallas my then fatherinlaw republican congressman jim collins a close friend of the president’s let me join him for a small gathering with the president at the collins’ ranch reagan told us a story of an irish farmer named paddy o’toole who is visited by an inspector from the welfare and work security ministry “tell me paddy” the official asked “ how do you compensate your workers” “well” says paddy “ i pay the field workers  a month plus room and board and an annual bonus based on our profits” “ah paddy good man that’s way above minimum wage and very generous excellent” says the bureaucrat “and your processors” “i pay them  monthly and also provide them room and board plus a slice of profits” “brilliant that’s way above the norm too you are indeed a good man paddy” says the inspector “now tell me are there any others” “oh yes” says paddy “there is the halfwit he works the longest hours of all shoulders all of the farm’s liabilities and risks clears about  a month gets to down a fifth of whiskey a fortnight and gets to sleep with me wife on the weekends if he is up to it” “paddy that is outrageous” says the inspector “ it is completely unacceptable it violates every rule regulation and law of the land i demand to see the ‘half wit’ immediately” “laddy” paddy replies “you’re lookin’ at ‘im” one could say that the “halfwits” that the elite scolds tend to look down upon revolted in the last election against taxes that strip them of what they earn by the sweat of their brow and the strength of their back regulations that dictate their behavior where they work and live and study and worship and tend to their medical needs and monetary policy that has crippled their savings and spending power policy which i will turn to shortly phil gramm’s verification if you are looking for statistical verification of the malaise that was afflicting the us economy go back and read last thursday’s excellent oped by former senator phil gramm and michael solon in the wall street journal they documented the fact that “economic growth during the past eight years averaged an astonishingly low  as compared with the  average throughout all of the postwar booms and busts before ” they pointed out that in the recovery from the recent recession “real growth in gross domestic product – our nation’s output – averaged  per year less than half the  average during previous recoveries of similar duration” mind you these anemic growth rates followed a devastating downturn that crippled employment and depleted the savings of the vast majority of americans as we approached the election we were indeed in the throes of what many economists described as “secular stagnation” small wonder that voters took a risk with a change agent who offered hope of relief and with change agents that ran the table not just in the electoral college but in the lower and upper houses of congress governors mansions and state legislatures  state attorneys generals offices and a majority of counties across the land  the choice was between a candidate and a platform advocating more of the same and one who offered to provide relief by changing gears entirely changing the gears of a ship of state as large as ours is not easy yesterday the wall street journal and nbc released a poll with a startling statistic when asked if government should do more – more – to solve problems and help people needs  of the respondents said “yes” while less than  said “no” that initiative should come from individuals themselves and businesses in the same issue of the journal there is another poll reported this one from the washington post that declares president trump “the least popular president in modern times” and yet if you read the fine print of those poll results while almost half of those polled said they had voted for mrs clinton in november only  said they would do so again despite the president’s high disapproval rating and muchreported problems in getting things done in his first  days he would still win the election if it were held today polls and ken arrow’s forecasts you can’t take too much comfort in of polls they are hardly the best predictors we learned this with brexit as well as with the preelection polls of our own election i monitor polls with a cynical eye just as i do economic forecasts they are as much art as they are presumably scientifically precise and they can lead to misleading conclusions if taken at face value the best story i can share with you on this front is an iconic one in central bank circles  one of the greatest modern economists was kenneth arrow during wwii he served as a weather forecasting officer in the us army air corps assigned the difficult task of producing month ahead weather forecasts as the date for omaha beach approached a thorough man he had his team review the accuracy of his forecasts they confirmed statistically that they were no more accurate than random rolls of dice so he cabled the high command to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty arrow’s recollection of his superior’s response was priceless “ the commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good however he needs them for planning purposes” the value of immediate polls like economic forecasts may be questionable but i do think what we can surmise by reading the entrails is that the american people know deep in their gut that we have been drifting for too long into complacency in accepting what some would call a “nanny state” and that as much as we have been getting used to it it somehow runs against the american fiber of individualism and selfreliance what i saw in this last election was a desire to have someone – anyone – pull us off the path of continued decline one might say that voters were looking for a version of thor’s hammer a crude force capable of leveling bureaucratic mountains and performing the most heroic feat of putting us back on a course of growth and expansion however great the risks risks to consider to be sure there are indeed great risks i won’t reiterate them here with the exception of saying that one that ranks at the top of my worry list is that of withdrawing from rather than improving the present world order i am ardent believer in american exceptionalism i believe the us is indeed a uniquely successful experiment and that we have been an example to the world which means we have an obligation to continue being exemplary i believe there is a need to update almost all of the postwwii structures ranging from the bretton woods institutions the un nato and other strategic pacts multilateral and bilateral which we have led and trade agreements like nafta which i spent four years implementing as deputy us trade representative to take account of the changes that have occurred since the fall of the soviet union the rise of china the growing nuclear threat of north korea the informationtechnology and cyber revolution and other phenomena that have changed the global economy and the practice of politics and diplomacy including ubiquitous social media and even saturday night live but making needed changes will require delicate diplomacy lest we unleash the destructive ghosts of isolationism and protectionism    let us hope that the new administration and the congress will guide us through muchoverdue changes with aplomb rather than bombast mexico redux being here in arizona i have special concern with the delicate subject of mexico a nation of  million people who until recently delivered one of the best performing economies in our hemisphere are our nation’s second largest trading partner and share by far the most important trading relationship with the most prosperous state in the union my home state of texas it will take a clever hand to update our relationship with mexico without destroying it and giving rise to a us equivalent of europe having turkey on its southern border by the way i assume you have all heard the quip “of course a wall works china built one and they haven’t seen a mexican in over  years” all humor aside pray that the new leadership corrects whatever imbalances exist in us global trade and other commitments without overturning the apple cart churchill’s dictum last comment on this front before turning to the challenge of present financial markets and monetary policy should you be tempted to give in to all engrossing angst over the change agent that has been elected to lead the american people remember churchill’s insightful dictum “americans always do the right thing… after they have tried everything else” monetary policy the good and the bad now to the economy and markets as president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of dallas i participated in federal open market committee fomc deliberations from  to  recall that despite my concerns and dissents the fomc cut overnight rates to zero and through quantitative easing expanded the holdings of the fed’s balance sheet from less than  billion when i joined to almost  trillion presently increasing the duration of the holdings in the portfolio to six years from what was typically the shortest of tenors the reason for doing so was to create what ben bernanke summarized as a “wealth effect” that would lift financial markets to the benefit of the economy when you cut rates to the “zero bound” then flatten the yield curve by purchasing trillions of dollars of mortgage backed and us treasury securities you are signaling to investors that they can literally discount future cash flows of the assets they invest in to infinity and sure enough with the fomc having bought in  trillion worth by the end of february  the equity market turned the first week of march and cap rates for properties began to plummet that was all to the good for investors in bonds stocks and property including housing as mortgage rates declined but the wealth effect the fomc hoped for did not spread as planned to the broader economy savers were penalized as bank deposit and money market fund returns were decimated and confidence in vehicles that ordinary americans depend upon – pension funds insurance companies and other vehicles used to protect their financial wherewithal in the long term – was undermined thus it took longer to restore confidence among consumers than monetary policy makers thought especially as fiscal policy and regulatory reform was dead in the water  with no encouragement from the fiscal and regulatory side companies used cheaper and more plentiful money to restructure their balance sheets buy in shares and increase dividend payouts rather than commit to job creating capital expenditures capex employment and the consumption that having a job allows took longer to ramp up than we had hoped accommodative policy is necessary but not sufficient to get the engine of the economy to full function money is the fuel for that engine but fiscal and regulatory policy is needed to incent the economy’s drivers – private sector operators – to use that money and step on the accelerator of capex and job creation to get that engine roaring the fed’s policy was followed and intensified in spades by the bank of japan and by the european central bank the fed curtailed it qe program at the end of october of  then  years to the day after we had cut the overnight funds rate to zero raised it a mere  basis points ths of onepercent  followed it up with two more moves to snug up to  and is on a declared path to keep nudging it up in  basis point increments through year end when all was said and done as i stand here today the fomc had acquired and now holds  trillion in mortgagebacked securities and  trillion in treasuries roughly  of all us treasuries outstanding with greater than  years’ maturity in its system open market account soma the bank of japan the ecb and the bank of england however carried on with their programs of radical monetary policy with the result that after the brexit vote took place interest rates hit lows the likes of which have never been seen the only reliable longterm records we have on sovereign bonds are maintained by the dutch holland preceded england and the us as the globe’s financial epicenter in the immediate aftermath of brexit year dutch sovereigns reached their lowest yield level in  years the bank of england’s benchmark rate hit its lowest level in  years and the benchmark  year us treasury traded at  the lowest rate since hamilton – not the musical but the real guy the iconic first secretary of the treasury and as we all know there was a plethora of long term issuance in the uk and in europe and in japan at negative or barely positive interest rates then as autumn approached the markets seemed to gag on the lowtonegative interest rate diet prescribed by central banks here in the us rates began to rise by the time of the presidential election the year treasury had risen to  in europe negative yields at longer tenors began to evaporate the tug of war between rising rates and the “orange swan” since the election rates have risen further today the year treasury is trading at roughly  and recently traded as high  one would have thought that underlying cash flows that support equities and cap rates would have been rediscounted to reflect this move but that has not yet happened i attribute this to the “orange swan” the hope president trump has engendered of tax reform deregulation and a more probusiness government has overridden what might ordinarily have been a reversal of force in markets outside the fixed income space we have seen this before between when ronald reagan was elected and then inaugurated the sp  soared  but in his first year in office equities declined  as reality set in on the timetable for implementing the changes he promised it wasn’t until midway through his second term in office for example that he was able to get tax reform in place to be sure the political dynamics are different today in his first term reagan had to deal with a democratic majority in the house where tax reform must be executed today trump has a sizeable but fractionated republican majority in the house and a marginal majority in the senate – but still one where the vicepresident can cast a deciding vote in confirming ms devos as education secretary or the senate can evoke the “nuclear option” to put judge gorsuch on the supreme court that said despite the power of the executive to issue unilateral orders tax and regulatory reform requires the congress let me show you how congress really works video locker room and cell phone we may be living in a new world where congress has abandoned its spendthrift ways still however probusiness president trump’s intentions and even with a republican congress that has long been prepared to effect change major initiatives take time we will see how long the “orange swan” effect holds under the circumstances and can counter the reality that a more robust economy should it materialize as hoped will result in higher interest rates and a federal reserve that will have to tighten monetary policy both at the short end and possibly along the yield curve as it deals with the roll over of maturing mbs and treasuries in its portfolio where  billion mature this year  billion mature in  and  billion mature in  how markets will rediscount future cash flows under those circumstances remains uncertain and then there are these historical precedents every republican president since ulysses s grant has experienced a recession in his first term including the gipper and since wwii the fed has initiated  tightening cycles  of those  landed the economy in recession that ought to make your day remembering marcus nadler now i don’t want you to leave today thinking i am just one more former central banking sourpuss i do see the potential for market and political storms members of nadsc will have to be alert and stay on the balls of their feet as the landscape in the united states shifts and is tested but i remind you that churchill was right we americans eventually do the right thing the us has the capacity to overcome even the greatest of reversals and mishaps and obstacles we always have and we always will i doubt any of you have ever heard of marcus nadler he was a leading thinker at the federal reserve during one of our toughest “stress tests” the great depression with gloom all around and the most thoughtful of people questioning the very survivability of our form of democracy nadler put forth four simple propositions first he said “you are right if you bet that the us economy will continue to expand” second “you are wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse” third “you are wrong if you bet that one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country” and fourth “you are right if you bet that leaders in business labor and government are sane reasonably informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them” i know nadler’s third and fourth propositions may seem pieeyed at present they were equally outlandish in the ’s and yet we went on from there to become the most prosperous and powerful country in the world we might be experiencing political volatility we may be poised for a financial markets correction but americans are a unique people we screw things up pretty badly pretty often but we eventually do the right thing we have no choice now but to do it again horseshift during the financial crisis i surveyed the global landscape and described the american economy as the “best looking horse in the glue factory” today i look at the us economy through a different equine lens  i have another visual of our potential that of secretariat at the belmont stakes in  slide of secretariat wining belmont here he is winning belmont by an unimaginable  lengths with a heart that weighed  pounds twice the size of any other thoroughbred’s that is the american economy during the course of my lifetime i have encountered countless naysayers and doomsayers—those that said europe would lap america that japan would lap america that the socalled brics and china would lap america that we could not compete in a postcold war globalized cyberized world  to this i say horseshift we are not the best looking horse in the glue factory we are secretariat we have the biggest heart we can win the race by  lengths if only we can be given freer rein by the fiscal and regulatory authorities just let us out of the stalls there’s no country there’s no people there’s nobody anywhere on the planet that can outpace us if we are given the freedom to run thank you the views

often joke that  years from now i hope people are saying ‘dang she looks good for her age’” – dolly parton “just because you live  years or  years doesn’t make it less meaningful they’re both short

later attributions welcome to the new improved fastertoread better yet stillfree thoughts from the frontline my team and i have been doing a lot of research on what my readers want the reality is that my newsletter writing has experienced a sort of “mission creep” over the years bluntly the letter is just a lot longer today than it was five or ten years ago and when i’m out talking to readers and friends especially those who give me their honest opinions they tell me it’s just too much there are some of you who love the length and wish it were even longer but you are not the majority not even close we all have time constraints and i wish to honor those so i am going to cut my letter back to its former size which was about  of the length of more recent letters note this paragraph is going to open the letter for the next month or so since not everybody clicks on every letter sigh surveys showed us it’s not because you don’t love me but because of demands on your time i want you to understand that i get it now to your letter… this week i have good news and bad news for you the good news is that you and your children will probably have much longer lives than you currently imagine the bad news is that you’ll have to pay the bill for them i’ll explain what that means in a minute first let me thank everyone who helped produce this year’s strategic investment conference as well as all who attended i know it sounds trite to say that this one was the best ever but it really was every speaker brought a unique and valuable perspective which the panels then mixed into new and even more interesting blends attendees asked probing and sometimes uncomfortable questions i think everyone left orlando bearing loads of new ideas if you missed sic you can still get our virtual pass it gives you audio recordings of all sessions all the slides that accompanied them and written transcripts it’s the next best thing to being there click here for more information and to place your order we will close this offer in early june so don’t wait too long i’m also pleased to announce that next year we’re taking sic back to our old home at san diego’s manchester hyatt the dates are march –  that’s just a little more than nine months away so now is the time to start planning your trip we’ll let you know when early bird registration opens in the fall now on to this week’s main course

account click here to login we never share your email with third parties thank you for subscribing one of my team members pointed me to a world economic forum white paper called “we’ll live to  – how can we afford it” regular readers know i’ve been saying we’ll live that long – and asking how we’ll pay for it – for several years now it is good to see davos man finally catching up with me the wef paper has some interesting data that i haven’t seen elsewhere to begin it breaks down life expectancy by birth year showing a different picture than we see from simple averages here are the global numbers as far as i can tell these estimates don’t consider the kind of major lifeextending breakthroughs that patrick cox writes about for us and that he and i both expect to be realized in the next few years rather the methodology of the wef paper seems to depend on extending current trends so i believe the numbers above are conservative note also these are median life expectancies not simple averages half the people in each group will live longer than the median most of today’s young children will live to see the s some many of the younger millennials will see their lives span three different centuries that’s astonishing here’s another table showing the differences among major countries for those born in the year  again this is astounding if correct a japanese child born in  who is  years old today has a  chance of living to  that will be the year  those in other developed countries are not far behind better yet the coming medical technologies will let us live to those ages or more without the decades of physical and mental decline that are now common we’re not just increasing lifespans we’re increasing “health spans” too the good news is that many of those antiaging breakthroughs are going to be coming to a pharmacy near you in the near future – as in five to ten years it is likely that you will live much longer and healthier than you are currently planning to most of us will be happy with that outcome the bad news is that you will have to make your money last those extra years like what you’re reading subscribe now and receive the full version of john

we had a panel at sic with patrick cox and leaders of three of the biotechnology companies he follows what they’re working on from different angles is almost unbelievable it is entirely possible that we will see cancer wiped out in the next five years scientists are making huge strides with heart disease dementia spinal cord injuries and the other great enemies of life and health one by one the dominoes are falling other companies we know about are working on the “fountain of middle age” whereby they intend to either delay or semireverse the aging process it won’t take you back to your youth but for many of us  years old sounds pretty good and there are groups like mike west’s at biotime inc that are working on technologies like induced tissue regeneration itr which will literally turn back your cellular clock this was science fiction and a pipette dream  years ago today it is simply science and it’s coming out of the theoretical stage and the petri dish and moving further up the experimental lab chain some of you will object “what will we do if everybody lives so long frankly that’s a firstworld problem i see very few people who ask that question offering to die if we live in a world that can figure out how to turn us young again give us automated cars and all sorts of abundant resources you think we’ll have trouble figuring out how to feed everyone and keep them occupied malthus was so wrong in so many ways the  trillion gap while this is wonderful news for humanity it will bring some challenges too the world is not financially prepared to support as many retirementage people as it will have to sustain in coming decades we have some huge adjustments in store specifically we already have a huge retirement savings shortfall both public and private i discussed that problem at length recently in part  and part  of my “angst in america” series adding millions more personyears to the equation will make the problem much worse the world economic forum’s white paper tries to quantify how much worse the personal retirement shortfall will be if current practices continue the amounts presently earmarked for retirement income via governmentprovided pension systems ie social security employer plans and individual savings fall far short of the mark here is the bad news in graphic form like what you’re reading subscribe now and

parties thank you for subscribing the bumps you see there are the difference between what is necessary to fulfill obligations defined as  of preretirement income and what has actually been saved or set aside to do so the darker blue is the  gap and light blue is a  estimate wef shows these eight countries which are obviously not the whole world simply because the data was available they also excluded assets held by the wealthiest  of the population in order to show the situation of nonwealthy citizens their full methodology is described on page  of this pdf file for those of you who want to take a deeper dive by  the total shortfall in these eight countries alone will be  trillion that number is so absurd that i feel very confident we will never have to face it one way and another some promises will be broken the only questions are whose and to what degree remember this is just the personal savings shortfall this is not the government and unfunded liability shortfall globally that runs into the multiple hundreds of trillions on top of the  trillion savings shortfall the present standard of retiring somewhere between ages  and  is not going to be sustainable when half the population lives to  or  – which is already realistic today – let alone  or more it’s just not possible if you’re like me you don’t intend to retire at  or maybe not at all but it’s nice to know we have the option future generations won’t according to wef the global dependency ratio under current policies will plummet from  today to  by  that means just four active workers for each retiree and that’s including developing and frontier markets developed markets will see a global dependency ratio of about  i see no way that can work wef doesn’t either here is their advice to political leaders given the rise in longevity and the declining dependency ratio policymakers must immediately consider how to foster a functioning labour market for older workers to extend working careers as much as possible there you have it straight from davos we must “extend working careers as much as possible” your dream of hanging up the work clothes at  and going on extended vacation will remain a dream until some later date early retirement will survive only for the kind of people who go to davos again for me this is fine i’m  and i love my work i plan to keep at it for many years to come but i understand many people don’t have that option they have health problems or their professions are being automated or they spent their career doing physical work that is no longer possible the medical advances i foresee will help but they’ll take time to become affordable to everyone some people are going to fall through the cracks like what you’re reading subscribe now and receive the full version

subscribing moreover simply saving more money probably isn’t an answer either interest rates are a function of supply and demand you can’t invest your savings in a highyield bond unless someone out there can borrow at that same yield when so many of us want to lend and no new borrowers appear supply and demand will keep yields low we already see this in today’s nearzirp conditions and they may not improve much part of the justification for zirp was that it would force capital into risk assets thereby stimulating the economy it now appears that the only thing stimulated was asset prices and by and by the risk is going to catch up with those taking unwise amounts of it that unhappy outcome will likely widen the retirement shortfall even further and so the expectation of longevity is going to motivate people to want to save more money except they’ll have to have jobs that pay enough to enable them to save money to flesh out the retirement plan this headline appeared a few weeks ago oops the council of economic advisers now estimates that artificial intelligence will replace  of lowwage jobs i’m not certain how they came up with that number – it seems high – but whatever is the figure turns out to be it’s alarming and the jobs we are creating today are not the highpaying manufacturing jobs that everybody wants to “bring back” they’re not there to be brought back there is actually a quite large “reshoring” movement going on but the companies that are coming back are doing so with automated technology and far fewer workers than before the advantage of using inexpensive offshore labor has fallen before the advantage of being close to your markets and “employing” robots and artificial intelligence the mckinsey global institute published a report last december that said “on a global scale we calculated the adoption of currently demonstrated automation technologies could affect  of the world economy’s  billion employees and  trillion in wages” that is an astonishing statistic by the way one of the subheads in that screenshot above points out that  of financial services positions are at high risk of being replaced if you are in the financial services industry maybe you should be thinking about how you can keep from being automated out of a job the jobs we are creating think  waiters and bartenders versus  manufacturing jobs i have children who work in the food service industry and i can tell you they are making barely enough to provide for themselves let alone raise a family or save for retirement officially the us unemployment rate is  there are  manufacturing jobs that employers can’t find suitable highly skilled candidates to fill last year the labor force participation rate declined by another  to  the employmenttopopulation ratio fell to  fewer of us are working and making enough to actually be able to save for retirement like what you’re reading subscribe now and receive the full version of john mauldins thoughts from the frontline delivered to your inbox each week subscribe now already have an account click here to login we never share your email with third parties thank you for subscribing in other words i don’t think we can invest our way out of this the obvious answer – extend the retirement age – has the unwelcome side effect of reducing job opportunities for younger workers at some point that might be okay if low birth rates create widespread worker shortages but the adjustment will take time the solution may turn out to be something presently unimaginable we don’t know where technology will take us and what opportunities it will create we also don’t know what political alliances can create what if the next time around we got not just president bernie sanders but a bernie sanderscompatible house and senate could we see a wealth tax in addition to a whole slew of other taxes would our dear leaders be willing to tax your retirement plan so that people without adequate savings could enjoy a more pleasant retirement forget fairness to you as an individual because they will be arguing about fairness to everyone in the country yet today the republican majority refuses to consider instituting a valueadded tax and lowering income taxes and corporate taxes to very low levels they could do this because they now have a majority they are simply afraid of a vat and are going to find themselves in far less sympathetic hands in a future crisis what we do know is this an unsustainable situation will not be sustained retirement as we know it is unsustainable it will give way to something else and maybe soon frustration is building in america because of the problems i highlighted above and we could well see an administration and congress that will push through a much less friendly vat plus income tax increases not cuts think it can’t happen when your back is against the wall and you’re down to your last few bullets and the enemy just keeps coming you start to very quickly consider all sorts of options within  years we are not only going to be thinking the unthinkable we will be doing the unthinkable and not just in the us but all over the world the unthinkable will be coming to a

the last week of june on monday june  she celebrates her birthday since i asked her to marry me on her birthday last year we are going to get married on her birthday this year just the two of us on the beach and the rest of the week relaxing and thinking of the future together while this approach does allow me to only have to remember one important day rather than two i am informed by many friends that it does not relieve me of the responsibility to buy two presents shane and i have lived together for four years now and she has pretty much figured out how i operate she has amazing

i’m fully committed to begin to bring together the various chapters of my book the age of transformation that project will hopefully benefit from my new commitment to write fewer words per letter maybe i can do that for a chapter or two of the book as well the reality is that each chapter could almost be a book of its own i have to make sure i don’t get carried away the book will not be a deep dive but rather a sweeping pass over the transformations that are coming to our world not just technologically but also socially demographically politically and especially geopolitically the economic world will be turned upside down as we make decisions to do previously unthinkable things to get clear of the enormous debt burdens and bubbles we created and with that i must hit the send button you

lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons that history has to teach” –      aldous huxley collected essays   “would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here” “that depends a good deal on where you want to get to” said the cat “i dont much care where –” said alice “then it doesnt matter which way you go” said the cat “– so long as i get somewhere” alice added as an explanation “oh youre sure to do that” said the cat “if you only walk long enough” – lewis carroll alice in wonderland  in a variant on the cheshire cat i would ask how you can know where you are if you don’t know where you came from you and i have lived through the first nearly  years of this topsyturvy century together and many of its details as well as its overarching themes deserve to be recalled but rather than offering you a dry plodding recap of recent history i’ve come up with a different and hopefully more fun way to revisit the past decade and a half i’ve been writing this letter for some  birthdays now well over  pages of collected work every word is still at my website  – a history if you will of what i was thinking at the time i asked my longtime and longsuffering editor charley sweet to go back over this past decade and a half and give us a review of what i was saying my birthday week when i perused what he came up with a few things leapt out at me first it turns out to be quite lucky that i was born in october because when we assembled all the letters for the first week of that month it turned out we hit on most of the big issues that came along in the first  years of the century the techbubble collapse and ensuing recession the actions of the fed in the early ’s especially with regard to the housing bubble the fundamental challenge – and promise – of accelerating change the subprime collapse and great recession including “the bailout” the problems with keynesian excesses at the fed and other major central banks the crisis in the eurozone and the healthcare crisis and obamacare second i could see my own thought process evolving and realized again how truly important it is to continually test your ideas in the marketplace  the plan was to take a short stroll through the history of my letters to get a feel for how our world and my thinking about it have changed over time as it developed charley presented me with a rather voluminous package of excerpts one far too long to send out as a thoughts from the frontline letter so i will have to viciously edit myself to make the retrospective more consumerfriendly for tftf readers but for those who are interested we are posting the entire summary here and it will remain available here as you read the entry for each year think back on your own thought process and actions at the time surprisingly as i did the same it appeared to me that more often than not i “got it right” even if i got it early so let’s climb into the wayback machine and take a spin through the last  tumultuous years we will begin with my call in october  for a recession in  note comments in brackets were written as we edited this everything else is verbatim from the original letters   the probability of a recession grows october   i get lots of mail from readers asking me to tell them if i think we will have a recession next year i think i can say with some authority that making predictions can get you out on a limb there are scores of variables that affect our economy  at any given time you can find trends that will seem to be pointing us to one conclusion and other trends that might yield the opposite conclusion it is only in hindsight that the pundits will tell us that we should have seen the most important trend all along so instead of predicting a flat yes or no i am going to assign some probability to the potential for a recession and then as we go along i will either increase the probability or decrease it… if the yield curve is functioning as an accurate predictor of recession we should be looking to see a recession next summer at the earliest and probably next fall as i think back over the last few recessions there were very few signs one year ahead that a recession was coming  for most economists and analysts the recession was a surprise even one quarter out  since the yield curve is an early predictor it would be more worrisome if we were seeing confirming signs in the economy now  that would mean the recession was probably going to be a very deep one  thus we shouldn’t be surprised that we see no recession clouds on the horizon… this year the yield curve went negative for a few days in early april but has been decidedly negative since july   the worst the yield curve has been this cycle is a  where it is today  the day average is now  the fed study says at this level there is approximately a  chance of a recession within four quarters i would remind you that the study also says the probability should be raised somewhat due to the more fluid bond markets of today so the number is probably around   that also means there is a  chance we won’t have a recession  but every time we have been at these yield curve levels for the last  years we have had a recession  a recession ensued in march  and persisted through november   rules of engagement october   a month after  and a month before recession officially ended as far as the economy this week not much has changed japan just gets worse and europe is getting weaker which means the us will have to lead the world out of a global recession but our consumers are saving dramatically more and spending less manufacturing is down as is capacity utilization etc etc long bonds are back to new highs same old same old but the cavalry is on the way the fed cuts again and again and pumps  into the economy in a few weeks congress is likely to provide significant fiscal stimulus and travel and business are starting to pick up again i can hear the bugles but i don’t see the troops yet it is still not safe to get out of the fort but it is time to make plans for the future… we are now in a new type of war the enemy is a few thousand individuals in  countries hidden in communities of millions unknown to  of their neighbors sympathized with and supported by nations and peoples who hate us for reasons most of america does not comprehend they intend to first destabilize us then demoralize us and finally provoke attacks upon various countries and groups within the islamic world they will try to tell the poor of these countries that an attack upon muslim terrorists is an attack upon all muslims turning their terror into a religious war they hope to stir the islamic masses to overthrow any moderate governments and install governments based upon the terrorists’ radical religious beliefs faced with an enemy which is both deadly and disperse with goals that don’t value the lives of either their enemies or themselves and with a methodology of war that is unlike anything we have experienced in this country we are now having to develop new strategies for conducting this war the rules of engagement for warfare have changed i think it is fair to say that our nation if not much of the world has realized that what would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago is now promoted as necessary and wise by almost all parts of the political equation it is clear that our military leaders are hoping to avoid the most costly and typical of all military mistakes using the tactics of the last war to fight the current one all’s turbulent on the investment front i am going to suggest that the rules of engagement as it were for investing are changing as well the advent of this war is going to accelerate that change what has worked for the last  years is now going to frustrate those who want to use the old investing rules to fight the next investment war if you do not see and adjust to these changes in my opinion you will not be happy with your investment returns over the next decade   history versus the fed october    longtime readers know i am a big fan of history central bankers businessmen and investors continually try to beat history to a pulp and often win a few early rounds like mohammed ali and his ropeadope strategy history lets his opponents wear themselves out throwing ineffective jab after futile blow in the end my man history always wins in the final rounds betting against history can look good for the first few rounds as history looks drugged but the outcome is always the same history told us there would be a recession in the fall of  because of the inverted yield curve in the fall of  which i wrote about in august and october of  an inverted yield curve is always followed a year later by recession greenspan and the fed fought back by aggressively lowering rates they lost hopefully they can do better fighting deflation… a little deflation is not the end of the world if the fed can “reflate” the economy prolonged systemic deflation will not be good however it will lead to lower home values which will hurt the housing market which will hurt jobs which will hurt consumption and trigger a serious recession the fed increasingly understands this dallas fed research director harvey rosenblum notes that “there is a distinct possibility inflation could morph into deflation” greg weldon notes a recent strange comment by the richmond fed president “the fed knows what to do if the feds fund rate has been pushed to zero and prices are falling” as weldon points out that must mean that at least a few people in the fed system think this is a distinct possibility there is a huge discussion on this issue going on inside the walls of the fed at least some of the leadership understands the problem they need to act now if greenspan lets deflation get away from him the next sword at his neck will not be the queen knighting him if the fed has to forestall deflation by printing even more money we are clearly told it will do so but eventually history will weigh in inflation will come back much stronger than it would have if the dollar had remained one of the main mechanisms to fight deflation this is the true implication of the problem with devaluing the dollar as when inflation does come back the fed will raise rates to stop it and thus bring on a serious recession think volcker and  we are between the proverbial rock and the hard place   the nature of change october   my career path echoes that of a million other entrepreneurs and businessmen and women we all deal with change in fact the amount of change that i have had to deal with is rather unremarkable there are millions of people who go through far more abrupt changes some of the changes were forced upon me some of them i willingly embraced i have told my friends that i hope this is the last time i have to “reinvent” myself i succumb to the fantasy that most investors have that the trends of today will continue and yet i know that this is not likely the field in which i plow and reap is changing rapidly and it is unlikely that in  years it will look the same at all… when i began  years ago there were no faxes no overnight delivery and phone service was expensive computers not until  years ago and they were toys compared to today’s machines it cost a lot of money to deliver a newsletter until just a few years ago now the marginal cost is almost nothing one or one million is pretty much the same to me research was a visit to the library to pour through books plus a few magazines and newsletters now i get scores of letters and articles every day delivered to my “mailbox” plus an almost infinite amount of data at my fingertips using something called google i have almost five gigabytes of research and other articles from just the past few years stored on my computer which i can search with a few strokes to write a letter like this even ten years ago would take a week after a month of research now i can access huge amounts of data each week and i write the letter on a computer in about five hours on friday afternoon… international readers very few ever graced my musings in the last decade now i have thousands of international readers often from some amazingly remote locations soon i am told my words may be translated into mandarin in short the changes have been dramatic at times i complain that it has been hard to adjust a lot of times those changes were just plain not fun some of them were very expensive lessons… since i plan to write for another  years i will probably witness another  cycles i will see yet another secular bull market in which longonly funds will be precisely where you should put your money some new technology will drive a fundamental change in the world things will change we’ll end up in  or whenever with a new cast of characters telling us that “this time is different” nanotechnology andor artificial intelligence andor cold fusion andor whatever alchemy we invent in the coming decades will be predicted to somehow repeal the business and investment cycle that has prevailed since the medes were trading with the persians it will be interesting to see if i can recognize when the “times are a’changing”… i am not certain about much but i am certain about this the future will be different than we think it will be today we can plan and dream but more than ever we need to think about plan b and c and d the odds are your personal world is going to change dramatically in the next ten years how you cope with the change and even use it to make your life better will be the measure of how well you thrive it is the unique ability of americans to deal with change that makes me an optimist we are going to have to face some very difficult changes which given the acceleration of change will be even more challenging than what we have already faced but coping with change is in our dna it is what we do i hope i can be part of your “let’s think about the future” planning for a long long time and i bet you we find the future far more fascinating and fun than we can even begin to imagine   horse racing and the cia october   this week we explore in depth an essay on how we think from that bastion of investment analysis the us central intelligence agency we look at the rookie mistakes made even by pros i describe one of my own more embarrassing rookie moments and how it highlights an investment principle that the bestperforming professionals always keep in mind i finish with a note on what you can give me and your friends for my birthday it should make for a lively letter… jim williams founder of the williams inference center recently sent me a pile of fascinating research which i am wading through one of the first articles i read was an essay by richards j heuer jr entitled “do you really need more information” it was published in a book called inside cia’s private world declassified articles from the agency’s internal journal  buried among articles on how and how not to to spy is this rather straightforward piece on what to do with the information you get and the problems with objective and accurate analysis that are caused by our human thought process the essay is quite timely even though it was written in the spring of  while reading the critique one could not help but wish that it would be required reading at the cia today perhaps we could have avoided a few problems but that is a topic for someone else our beat today is thinking about money i am guilty mea culpa i am constantly researching looking at sometimes obscure data trying to discern patterns and trends but what to do with all of it how do we filter it into useful and investable ideas this article challenges the often implicit assumption that lack of information is the principal obstacle to accurate intelligence estimates once an experienced analyst has the minimum information necessary to make an informed judgment obtaining additional information generally does not improve the accuracy of his estimates additional information does however lead the analyst to become more confident in his judgment to the point of overconfidence horse racing and the cia heuer describes a study done about betting on horse races they took eight professional handicappers someone who sets the betting odds based on calculations of the outcome of a contest especially a horse race and asked them to rank  different pieces of data about a horse race as to what they thought was most important do you factor in the jockey’s record as well as the recent record of the horse the weather the competition how much weight is the horse carrying what is the length of the race there are scores of variables then the handicappers were given what they felt were the five most important pieces of data and asked to project the winner of a race actual names and races were not given so as to not bias the projections they were also asked to rank their confidence about their predictions now it gets interesting they were then given   or  pieces of what they had individually considered to be the most important information three of the handicappers actually showed less accuracy as the amount of information increased two improved their accuracy and three were unchanged but as a group their accuracy did not improve and in fact was slightly down but with each increase in information their confidence went up in fact by the end their confidence had in fact doubled if they had actually been at the track and were betting would they have doubled their bets as they became more confident human nature says yes they would but that confidence would not have made them any better predictors they just doubled their bets which magnified their gains or losses think of it like adding leverage to your stock portfolio “a series of experiments to examine the mental processes of medical doctors diagnosing illness found little relationship between thoroughness of data collection and accuracy of diagnosis” another study was done with psychologists and patient information and diagnosis again increasing knowledge yielded no better results but significantly increased confidence the inference is clear and quite important “experienced analysts have an imperfect understanding of what information they actually use in making judgments they are unaware of the extent to which their judgments are determined by a few dominant factors rather than by the systematic integration of all available information analysts use much less available information than they think they do”   ah brave new world october   last week we looked at how technology has the potential to slow and possibly reverse aging within the next two decades marvelous cures for the main causes of death including cancer heart disease dementia and alzheimer’s not to mention the potential to manage weight are in our future amazing innovations in communications are rapidly coming at us too as is an increased ability to process information hunger and malnutrition are in our sights as we increase the ability to bring in harvests that yield more as well as develop biotech and nanotech processes to manufacture food further down the road the ability to manipulate molecules at the quantum level will mean we can produce the materials we need at much lower costs as we map and reverse engineer the software that runs our brains powerful new software can be developed on machines which can aid in the development of whole new technologies as well as allow us to directly access information and communicate with each other it will mean i can get rid of this annoying keyboard which is bouncing around as the plane i am on hits a little turbulence at the end of the letter i will speculate about how we invest in these trends next week we get back to our usual beat of finance but judging from the letters i am getting a lot of you are enjoying the speculation about the future ray kurzweil in his latest book the singularity is near writes of an almost utopian future for him as well as others such a future of marvels cannot come too soon they see a transition to a world where we merge with our machines allowing us to think and work at far faster speeds than our unaided biological “wetware” is capable of and we’ll do it from bodies that do not succumb to disease or aging there are many objections to his work from a variety of quarters to his credit he does not dodge or ignore them he spends almost a hundred pages in singularity outlining the various criticisms of his views of the future and then rebutting them ray sees us approaching a “singularity” or point in the future where humanity and machines evolve into something we would call distinctly posthuman at that point things change in ways we cannot predict or presently even comprehend… ray sees this event as happening around  with life extension from biotech and nanotech happening in the s and s   the inflation of expectations october   this week we had two more federal reserve members repeat what has become the theme for their chorus but not one the market seems to be paying much attention to it should be the market believes the fed will soon start to cut rates perhaps as early as first quarter of next year it is not altogether clear that this will be the case i must admit to being somewhat baffled as to the apparent disregard by the stock market for what i view as a tough environment in the medium term with either a slowdown or a mild recession being suggested by numerous factors i was forecasting a recession the next month due to the yield curve along with other factors while there are a lot of positive features to the economy to me the risk to the economy still seems to be to the downside i take small comfort in the fact that this perspective is shared by fed vice chairman donald kohn a very solid economist and financial market observer… the need to raise rates rumor has it that kohn was greenspan’s preferred choice to follow him in any event he is closely tied to bernanke i think it is highly likely that bernanke shares his sentiments but they are not nearly as hawkish as the speech on thursday by new philadelphia federal reserve president charles plosser in a speech peppered with stern antiinflation warnings and echoing the sentiments expressed by dallas fed president fisher which we discussed at length about a few weeks ago plosser said the us central bank’s very credibility was at stake when it came to keeping prices under control… quick aside ben bernanke spoke this week as well as cleveland fed president sandra pianalto in addition to the previous two fed members they all acknowledged that the slowing housing market is a concern but that the rest of the economy seems to be doing fine count them at least publicly in the slowdown and no recession camp… the fed has a very interesting problem they acknowledge the economy is slowing but at least publicly think the slowdown will be mild if that is the case then it may not bring inflation down below  or even close if that is the case do they raise rates at some point next year as plosser suggested not just to maintain their credibility but to stave off inflation expectations a slowing labor market central to their problem is the employment rate and consumer spending housing is definitely slowing down at the height of the housing market consumers on a national basis were borrowing almost  of their income as mortgage equity withdrawals this cashout refinancing added over  and maybe as much as  to gdp such refinancing has dropped to under  and looks like it is in freefall on the charts bernanke said in his speech that a slowing housing market could shave  off of gdp gdp last quarter was  between housing and lower consumer spending due to less borrowing it doesn’t take a lot to get that down to the  range there is a close correlation between housing prices and consumer confidence and thus consumer spending consumer spending does not have to contract it just has to slow down for it to have economic repercussions when home building is going to slow down over at least the next two quarters housing prices peaked in mid and by dec  we were officially in a recession   the slow motion recession october   let’s recall what john hussman said earlier about recessions being caused by a mismatch between the goods and services supplied to the economy and the demand for them in past recessions this has generally come to a culmination where employment turns down relatively quickly and profits take a dive let me offer a scenario where it might be different this time in past recessions there were generally some portions of the economy that grew beyond the respective demand for their products or services andor a bubble in some sector burst such an event happened relatively quickly and it took some time for there to be a shift of employment to other sectors and for the economy to start growing again if we see a recession now it is going to be because of the bursting of the housing bubble but housing is different there is no “marktomarket” pricing you can’t look up the value of your house on a computer screen like you can your stocks or bonds people tend to think their houses are special they know how much time and effort they put into maintaining the house and experience has taught them that over time if they are patient they will get a good price for their home they become reluctant to sell at a reduced price enter reality home values are starting to fall and in some areas by a lot for several reasons first because homebuilders are cutting prices in order to move inventory off the market they have to raise cash in order to pay back loans even if it means losing money on the sale of houses they are in survival mode a story on bloomberg notes that some smaller home builders are selling homes at a  discount in order to raise cash dr horton put  condominiums up for auction in san diego local real estate agent steven moran said “i ran the numbers and the condos sold for between  cents and  cents on the dollar based on the original asking prices” the fact that some homebuilders may lose money is not a problem for the general economy the problem is that anyone trying to sell or refinance a home in one of those neighborhoods is now going to see the value of their home come down – perhaps substantially – in the appraisal they will need for the mortgage appraisers look at recent sales of comparable homes to come up with a value for the home if your neighbor’s home sells for  less then your appraisal is going to come down  as well and the amount of money you can borrow on your home depends upon that appraisal ok then you can just stay in the home and make that mortgage payment and if you made a conventional loan that’s what you would do you might not like the fact that your home is worth less but you won’t go through bankruptcy and risk your other assets by not making the payments except for about  home buyers who did not get conventional mortgages says good friend gary shilling subprimes leaped to  trillion or  of all adjustable rate mortgages arms in the first quarter a  times jump from  and  of mortgage broker customers with arms were unable to refinance into new loans in august given their low initial down payments and falling prices that have put their equity in negative territory estimates are that the cumulative loss on subprime mortgages will be  billion in home equity and cost financial institutions  billion   the curve in the road october   the “bailout plan” was passed will it work the answer depends on what your definition of “work” is if by work you mean no more government intervention and no further costly programs and a functioning market then the answer is no but there are things it will do this week i try to help you see what might lie ahead around the curve in the road we look at how the rescue plan will function see what is happening in the economy and finally muse as to whether muddle through is really in our future… first let’s look at the “rescue plan” as passed by congress as i pointed out last week this is a bad bill but it was necessary to pass something and soon earlier this week i sent out a report that reviewed a study of  major baking crises the conclusion navigating them successfully depended upon quick action as everyone should know the credit markets are almost completely frozen libor is bidonly no offers commercial paper markets are imploding and what is trading is often at rates that are much higher than they were a few months ago corporations are being strangled on high rates corporations have little or no access to normal credit markets and they will face massive problems when it comes time for them to roll over shortterm debt… as i have said repeatedly for months the problem is that financial institutions are having to deleverage they have massive losses and simply have to raise capital in order to survive if you can’t raise equity capital and most can’t one of the ways you get by is by making fewer loans and taking less risk you also charge more for the loans you do make larger institutions cannot raise capital on competitive terms ge is an aaarated company yet they had to pay warren buffett  to get  billion plus inthemoney warrants worth at least another  buffett is likely to double his money on this deal over  years a short while ago ge could get shortterm commercial paper for a few percentage points that difference is going to significantly impact ge’s bottom line but they had no real choice they took the money as did goldman sachs yet another buffett  billion preferredshare purchase with more warrants at a rate that even goldman will find it hard to make money on but they had to raise capital quickly and they had little choice… if ge and goldman are paying  what do you think it costs a firm with “only” a b rating  more junk bond yields have simply gone ballistic firms that used the credit market to access capital are simply shut out now if they are a small public company they can go to what are known as pipe hedge funds private investment in public equity that sell equity at usurious rates which is what buffett does but on a larger scale but a small or mediumsized private company it is a hard time to go looking for money left alone for the markets to work out the economy of the us and the world would be in a depression within two quarters and would need years to recover think japan… necessary but not sufficient now for the bad news the “rescue plan” was necessary but not sufficient to fix the crisis there is going to have to be more heavy lifting i’m afraid let me offer a few ideas about what possible actions might be taken in the future i am not advocating these actions i am simply telling you what might happen these are possible because authorities will do whatever they deem necessary to avoid a systemic economic meltdown and a potential depression… i had a lot of readers write me very nice letters this week starting out with how much they like my letter my insights etc then they mostly – but not all – and politely launched on me for backing the rescue plan many of you had much better ideas than what was passed by congress which is not surprising i really do hate the idea of having to support a rescue plan it goes against my every instinct but i also know that doing nothing would result in an economy that would blow right through  unemployment within a few quarters and take years to recover the stock markets and the savings of millions of retirees would be wiped out home values would really go into a tailspin being right in theory is not worth seeing that kind of devastation… oops we did see  unemployment and it took years to recover in the next few weeks and months i think you can count on more extraordinary actions by the fed and treasury to try and jumpstart the credit markets actions that were highly improbable a few months ago will be on the table will the fed open its balance sheet to nonbanks possibly if they can guarantee money markets will there be a scheme to insure commercial paper at some price not out of the question will european governments take more equity in large european banks very likely will the fed andor the treasury invest even more capital in larger financial institutions given that we the people now own  of aig and  of fannie and freddie it is certainly within the realm of possibility that we will be the proud owners of even more formerly private institutions again this is not just a us issue we will likely see similar actions in europe and some of the developing world this is a worldwide crisis and the response will be from central banks all over the world… next week we will explore the economic landscape in detail but let me provide a few thoughts as i have said for a long time we will be talking about deflation this time next year recessions are by definition deflationary events given that we have had two bubbles burst housing and credit there is even more potential for deflationary pressures add into the mix the deleveraging process which will take years to finally abate and the recent bout of price inflation caused by energy and food will pass as demand destruction for oil will hold oil prices in check as i have said for a long time the next move of the fed is likely to be a cut we are now close to such an action a  fed funds rate is again a real possibility i am not sure it will help as much as some market participants think but i think it likely the fed will move before the end of the year if not much sooner europe and japan are also probably in recession and it is likely we are going to see a worldwide global slowdown it would be nice if the european central bank the bank of england and the fed could coordinate a joint rate cut to signal that they are working together on the problems i would not want to be short the markets that day at the beginning of the year i was predicting a small recession with a lengthy and slow recovery period i now think that the recession could be deeper than a  contraction i think we could see a rather lengthy recession quite simply the credit crisis has been allowed to spin out of control that congress almost failed to act is beyond belief given the above circumstances it is not out of the realm of possibility that a recession lasts through the middle of  as recessions go that is a long time but trust me on this it will pass the recovery will be a slow muddle through affair though it will be a few years before we are growing at a sustained    another finger of instability october   here is an extended excerpt from perhaps the most popular letter i ever wrote note that i wanted to talk not just about sandpiles but about fundamental risks to the economy the credit crisis happened because of greenspan’s monetary policy or maybe it was a collective mania or any number of things just as the proverbial butterfly flapping its wings in the amazon triggers a storm in europe maybe an investor in st louis triggered the credit crisis crazy maybe not today we will look at what complexity theory tells us about the reasons for earthquakes tornados and the movement of markets then we look at how the world and that investor in st louis are all tied together in a critical state of course what state and how critical are the issues ubiquity complexity theory and sandpiles we are going to start our explorations with excerpts from a very important book by mark buchanan called ubiquity why catastrophes happen i highly recommend it to those of you who like me are trying to understand the complexity of the markets not directly about investing although he touches on it it is about chaos theory complexity theory and critical states it is written in a manner any layman can understand there are no equations just easytograsp wellwritten stories and analogies as kids we all had the fun of going to the beach and playing in the sand remember taking your plastic buckets and making sandpiles slowly pouring the sand into an ever bigger pile until one side of the pile started an avalanche imagine buchanan says dropping one grain of sand after another onto a table a pile soon develops eventually just one grain starts an avalanche most of the time it is a small one but sometimes it builds on itself and it seems like one whole side of the pile slides down to the bottom well in  three physicists named per bak chao tang and kurt weisenfeld began to play the sandpile game in their lab at brookhaven national laboratory in new york now actually piling up one grain of sand at a time is a slow process so they wrote a computer program to do it not as much fun but a whole lot faster not that they really cared about sandpiles they were more interested in what are called nonequilibrium systems they learned some interesting things what is the typical size of an avalanche after a huge number of tests with millions of grains of sand they found that there is no typical number “some involved a single grain others ten a hundred or a thousand still others were pilewide cataclysms involving millions that brought nearly the whole mountain down at any time literally anything it seemed might be just about to occur” the piles were indeed completely chaotic in their unpredictability now let’s read this next paragraph from buchanan slowly it is important as it creates a mental image that helps me understand the organization of the financial markets and the world economy emphasis mine to find out why such unpredictability should show up in their sandpile game bak and colleagues next played a trick with their computer imagine peering down on the pile from above and coloring it in according to its steepness where it is relatively flat and stable color it green where steep and in avalanche terms ‘ready to go’ color it red what do you see they found that at the outset the pile looked mostly green but that as the pile grew the green became infiltrated with ever more red with more grains the scattering of red danger spots grew until a dense skeleton of instability ran through the pile here then was a clue to its peculiar behavior a grain falling on a red spot can by dominolike action cause sliding at other nearby red spots if the red network was sparse and all trouble spots were well isolated one from the other then a single grain could have only limited repercussions but when the red spots come to riddle the pile the consequences of the next grain become fiendishly unpredictable it might trigger only a few tumblings or it might instead set off a cataclysmic chain reaction involving millions the sandpile seemed to have configured itself into a hypersensitive and peculiarly unstable condition in which the next falling grain could trigger a response of any size whatsoever something only a math nerd could love scientists refer to this as a critical state the term critical state can mean the point at which water goes to ice or steam or the moment that critical mass induces a nuclear reaction etc it is the point at which something triggers a change in the basic nature or character of the object or group thus and very casually for all you physicists we refer to something being in a critical state or use the term critical mass when there is the opportunity for significant change but to physicists the critical state has always been seen as a kind of theoretical freak and sideshow a devilishly unstable and unusual condition that arises only under the most exceptional circumstances in highly controlled experiments in the sandpile game however a critical state seemed to arise naturally through the mindless sprinkling of grains thus they asked themselves could this phenomenon show up elsewhere in the earth’s crust triggering earthquakes or as wholesale changes in an ecosystem – or as a stock market crash “could the special organization of the critical state explain why the world at large seems so susceptible to unpredictable upheavals” could it help us understand not just earthquakes but why cartoons in a thirdrate paper in denmark could cause worldwide riots buchanan concludes in his opening chapter there are many subtleties and twists in the story  but the basic message roughly speaking is simple the peculiar and exceptionally unstable organization of the critical state does indeed seem to be ubiquitous in our world researchers in the past few years have found its mathematical fingerprints in the workings of all the upheavals i’ve mentioned so far earthquakes ecodisasters market crashes as well as in the spreading of epidemics the flaring of traffic jams the patterns by which instructions trickle down from managers to workers in the office and in many other things at the heart of our story then lies the discovery that networks of things of all kinds  atoms molecules species people and even ideas  have a marked tendency to organize themselves along similar lines on the basis of this insight scientists are finally beginning to fathom what lies behind tumultuous events of all sorts and to see patterns at work where they have never seen them before… now let’s couple this idea with a few other concepts first nobel laureate hyman minsky points out that stability leads to instability the more comfortable we get with a given condition or trend the longer it will persist and then when the trend fails the more dramatic is the correction the problem with longterm macroeconomic stability is that it tends to produce unstable financial arrangements if we believe that tomorrow and next year will be the same as last week and last year we are more willing to add debt or postpone savings in favor of current consumption thus says minsky the longer the period of stability the higher the potential risk for even greater instability when market participants must change their behavior and three years later we can now all see that truth but it was not as obvious to a lot of people in  relating this to our sandpile the longer that a critical state builds up in an economy or in other words the more “fingers of instability” that are allowed to develop a connection to other fingers of instability the greater the potential for a serious “avalanche”… a second related concept is from game theory the nash equilibrium named after john nash is a kind of optimal strategy for games involving two or more players whereby the players reach an outcome to mutual advantage if there is a set of strategies for a game with the property that no player can benefit by changing his strategy while if the other players keep their strategies unchanged then that set of strategies and the corresponding payoffs constitute a nash equilibrium a stable disequilibrium so we ended up in a critical state of what paul mcculley calls a “stable disequilibrium” we have players of this game from all over the world tied inextricably together in a vast dance through investment debt derivatives trade globalization international business and finance each player works hard to maximize their own personal outcome and to reduce their exposure to “fingers of instability” but the longer we go on asserts minsky the more likely and violent an “avalanche” is the more the fingers of instability can build the more that state of stable disequilibrium can go critical on us… so where are the fingers of instability today where are the fault lines that could trigger another crisis are there any early warning signs i see two possibilities one positive and one negative chad starliper sent me the following graph it shows the debttogdp ratio for the us adding in various levels of debt for instance the ratio of debt to gdp for all levels of government debt is  but if you add household and business debt along with the gse governmentsponsored enterprises like fannie and freddie the ratio rises to  and if you add in future benefits of social security and medicare the number becomes more like    just as i was writing in  about the potential for a crisis and yet the party went on for quite some time i think the party can limp along now but there will come a point when the party is over interest rates on the long end will rise precipitously forcing mortgages up and making the deficit even worse it will be an even worse crisis than the one we have just gone through and there will be fewer options for policy makers and none of them will be good or pleasant and it will take most people unawares they will see the current trend and project it into the future and they will be hit hard can we avoid this calamity yes we can wrestle the us budget deficit back under some kind of control close to nominal gdp or on a clear trajectory to get there within a reasonable time say a few years as noted above we can run deficits close to nominal gdp almost forever but there is no political willpower to do that now and so the market will at some point force the hand of the political class that investor in st louis or china or  will decide not to buy government debt at such low rates the avalanche will start and everyone will be surprised at the ferocity of the crisis except you gentle reader you have been warned   the ride of the keynesian cowboys october   to ease or not to ease that is the question we will take up this week and if we do get another round of quantitative easing qe will it make any difference as i asked last week what if they threw an inflation party and no one came the fed is basically down to one bullet in its policy gun it cannot lower rates beyond zero although it can pull down longerterm rates if it so chooses but lower rates have not so far been the answer to creating jobs and inflation all lesssubtle instruments of monetary policy have been tried the final option is massive quantitative easing the monetization of us government debt as the saying goes if all you have is a hammer all the world looks like a nail and after the last fomc meeting the markets have openly embraced quantitative easing… the keynesian cowboys are saddling their qe horses and they intend to ride they have no idea what the end of the trail looks like this is all a guess based on pure theory and models like the broken money multiplier and i really question whether the result they hope for is worth the risk of the unintended consequences as i wrote a few weeks ago if it is because they don’t have enough capital then adding liquidity to the system will not help that if it is because they don’t feel they have creditworthy customers do we really want banks to lower their standards isn’t that what got us into trouble last time if it is because businesses don’t want to borrow all that much because of the uncertain times will easy money make that any better as someone said “i don’t need more credit i just need more customers” how much of an impact would  trillion in qe give us not much according to former fed governor larry meyer who according to morgan stanley  maintains a largescale macroeconometric model of the us economy that is widely used in the private sector and in public policymaking circles these types of models are good for running “what if” simulations meyer estimates that a  trillion asset purchase program would  lower treasury yields by bp  increase gdp growth by pp in  and pp in  and  lower the unemployment rate by pp by the end of  and pp by the end of  however meyer admits that these may be “highend estimates”… it is clear at least from the speeches i read that if the economy continues to sputter and looks like it may fall into recession that the need to do something will overwhelm all caution not trying the last tool in the box if the economy is rolling over is just not something that will be considered by those of the keynesian persuasion never mind that congress is getting ready to raise taxes and has already done so in the case of obamacare to the tune of almost  of gdp in the face of a slowing economy the fed is going to step in and try to do something let me be clear we do not have a monetary problem and whatever solutions we need are not monetary this is on congress and the administration the fed needs to step aside   an irish haircut october   just as only four short years ago it was all subprime all the time and then it was the credit crisis now it is europe when will greece default and which banks will implode as a result is there another banking crisis in our future i just came back from a whirlwind fourcountry visit to europe and i will try to offer a few insights… here is the issue for europe the amount of money needed for ireland is going to be a lot more than they now think or at least are willing to admit when eurozone politicians worry about “contagion” or one country wanting the debt relief that another country gets it is a very real worry and rightfully so as voters in portugal or spain or gasp italy who are burdened by debt that is seemingly intractable will also want relief it is not just an irish condition it is a human trait and the money that europe needs will overwhelm the € billion esfs fund stratfor and others think it will take at least € trillion the boston consulting group put out a report that suggests the total number at the end of the day will need to be drum roll wait for it over € trillion i don’t like their proffered solutions but their analysis of the debt and the need for relief is sobering whatever the figure it is staggering and one the eurozone is not willing to pay at this moment when the crisis hits who knows but now that much is not on the table there is talk of leveraging the esfs up to € trillion but that seems odd as normally you have to have equity to leverage more debt the esfs is debt created by promises to pay by the member governments are we now at the point where we need to leverage our leverage it seems to me that is what got us into the problems to begin with france is at risk of losing its aaa rating from my farremoved seat i think it is almost a certainty they will as the amount they will have to raise for french banks is enormous add another few hundred billion euros for bailout funds for spain and italy and the idea of aaa euro debt goes right out of window to keep the current aaa a majority of guarantees needs to be from aaa countries that is a very touchy issue right now read the following quote from angela merkel chancellor of germany and someone who is a believer in a strong united europe this is from a supporter of europe mind you while stepping up her rejection of a greek default she merkel said that issuance of shared debt by euro countries isn’t the solution to the problem spilling from greece even though some may long for the ‘big bang’ to end the debt crisis “whoever believes that has no clue about the economy” she said “no one can say with certainty” what would happen if greece defaults she said “before i make a nifty step into an adventure i have to ask whether we can really handle this and can we oversee what we are doing” merkel said that her “entire council” of economic advisers says greek debt should be restructured advice that she is not prepared to take “if we tell a country ‘we cancel half of your debt’ that’s a great deal” she said “then the next guy will immediately show up and say he wants the same” “you can open any newspaper and see there’s a broad international debate” she said “i’m not an economist or a theorist i and the german government have to consider the consequences of what we do” greece will only get more promises and more funds until merkel gets a call from her accountants who tell her they have figured out which banks need government funds the next day she will call papandreou and tell him to hold a conference announcing the haircut that greece will get it will all be orchestrated to the color of their socks from what i heard europeans banks are worse than even the dire reports you read in the papers spreads are widening and liquidity is drying up drexia is the tip of the iceberg i really have to wonder how much france can do in regards to its bank debt will the ecb lend them enough money the answer is yes but we are talking a great deal of debt for a country with serious fiscal deficits and where government spending is already  of gdp with rising healthcare and pension costs think french politicians will try and get their unions and public workers to take a  pay cut the french will not be civilized and stoical like the irish they will take to the streets we are now in the final innings of the endgame greece is likely to default no later than the end of this year if not by the end of this month which for all intents and purposes they have already done if you can’t get the market to finance you that means you can’t pay your bills without the kindness of strangers if greece were an individual or a company it would be in bankruptcy proceedings it is now just a matter of time can the euro survive the short answer is yes but not without a lot of pain on the part of a lot of people the drive for a united europe is strong and may indeed overcome the drive that would tear the union apart i actually hope so but it will not be done without a lot of sacrifice i think the valuation of the euro is at serious risk and while european markets look cheap on a relative and historicalvaluation basis one needs to ask compared to what long european stocks short the euro maybe especially if the germans turn the ecb loose as a way to keep and pay the price for the european union i heard no consensus there are dozens of different plans enough to make any politician’s head swim stay tuned   economic singularity october   this is one of my alltime favorite letters you can click on the link above to read the entire letter but i’ll excerpt portions there is considerable disagreement throughout the world on what policies to pursue in the face of rising deficits and economies that are barely growing or at stall speed both the austerity and stimulus sides look at the same set of realities and yet draw drastically different conclusions both sides marshal arguments based on rigorous mathematical models “proving” the correctness of their favorite solution and both sides can point to counterfactuals that show the other side to be insincere or just plain wrong… both sides have arguments that are intellectually appealing yet both cannot be right at the same time what i think we need to consider is the possibility that there is something that is happening outside of traditional economic theories which will mean that following either traditional policy solution could lead to disaster but is there a third alternative if we want to find one the first thing we need to do is to properly diagnose the problem in today’s letter we begin to explore why the models aren’t working sometimes the best way to understand a complex subject is to draw an analogy so with an apology to all the true mathematicians among my readers today we will look at what i will call the economic singularity and maybe we’ll have a little fun on the way… singularity was originally a mathematical term for a point at which an equation has no solution in physics it was proven that a large enough collapsing star would eventually become a black hole so dense that its own gravity would cause a singularity in the fabric of spacetime a point where many standard physics equations suddenly have no solution beyond the “event horizon” of the black hole the models no longer work in general relativity an event horizon is the boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer in a black hole it is the “point of no return” ie the point at which the gravitational pull becomes so great that nothing can escape… i think we can draw a rough parallel between a black hole and our current global economic situation for physicists this will be a very rough parallel indeed but work with me please an economic bubble of any type but especially a debt bubble can be thought of as an incipient black hole when the bubble collapses in upon itself it creates its own black hole with an event horizon beyond which all traditional economic modeling breaks down any economic theory that does not attempt to transcend the event horizon associated with excessive debt will be incapable of offering a viable solution to an economic crisis even worse it is likely that any proposed solution will make the crisis more severe the minsky moment debt leverage can be a very good thing when used properly for instance if debt is used to purchase an incomeproducing asset whether a new machine tool for a factory or a bridge to increase commerce then debt can be netproductive hyman minsky one of the greatest economists of the last century saw debt in three forms hedge speculative and ponzi roughly speaking to minsky hedge financing occurred when the profits from purchased assets were used to pay back the loan speculative finance occurred when profits from the asset simply maintained the debt service and the loan had to be rolled over and ponzi finance required the selling of the asset at an ever higher price in order to make a profit minsky maintained that if hedge financing dominated then the economy might well be an equilibriumseeking wellcontained system on the other hand the greater the weight of speculative and ponzi finance the greater the likelihood that the economy would be what he called a deviationamplifying system thus minsky’s financial instability hypothesis suggests that over periods of prolonged prosperity capitalist economies tend to move from a financial structure dominated by stable hedge finance to a structure that increasingly emphasizes unstable speculative and ponzi finance… “a fundamental characteristic of our economy” minsky wrote in  “is that the financial system swings between robustness and fragility and these swings are an integral part of the process that generates business cycles” wikipedia but a businesscycle recession is a fundamentally different thing than the end of a debt supercycle such as much of europe is tangling with japan will soon face and the us can only avoid with concerted action in the first part of the next year a businesscycle recession can respond to monetary and fiscal policy in a more or less normal fashion but if you are at the event horizon of a collapsing debt black hole monetary and fiscal policy will no longer work the way they have in the past or in a manner that the models would predict there are two contradictory forces battling in a debt black hole expanding debt and collapsing growth without treading again on ground covered in many past letters let’s take it as a given that if you either cut government spending or raise taxes you are going to reduce gdp over the short run academic studies suggest the short run is  quarters to argue that raising taxes or cutting spending has no immediate effect on the economy flies in the face of mathematical reality note that i’m not arguing for one approach or the other just simply stating that there will be consequences either way the country might be better off with higher taxes andor more spending or the opposite but those choices are going to have consequences in both the short and long term second there is a limit to how much money a government can borrow that limit clearly varies from country to country but to suggest there is no limit puts you clearly in the camp of the delusional the event horizon in our analogy the event horizon is relatively easy to pinpoint it is what rogoff and reinhart call the “bang” moment when a country loses the confidence of the bond market for russia it came at  of debttogdp in  japan is at  of debttogdp and rising even as its population falls – the bang moment approaches obviously greece had its moment several years ago spain lost effective access to the bond market last year minus european central bank intervention other countries will follow… the policy problem is how do you counteract the negative pull of a black hole of debt before it’s too late how do you muster the “escape velocity” to get back to a growing economy and a falling deficit – or dare we say even a surplus to pay down the old debt how do you reconcile the competing forces of insufficient growth and too much debt while deficit spending can help bridge a national economy through a recession normal business growth must eventually take over if the country is to prosper keynesian theory prescribed deficit spending during times of business recessions and the accumulation of surpluses during good times in order to be able to pay down debts that would inevitably accrue down the road the problem is that the model developed by keynesian theory begins to break down as we near the event horizon of a black hole of debt… deficit spending can be a useful tool in countries with a central bank such as the us but at what point does borrowing from the future and our children constitute a failure to deal with our own lack of political will in regards to our spending and taxation policies there is a difference as i think hyman minsky would point out between borrowing money for infrastructure spending that will benefit our children and borrowing money to spend on ourselves today with no future benefit in my mind i am playing reruns of old star trek episodes with capt kirk shouting “dammit scotty you’ve got to give me more power” as they try to escape a looming black hole except in our national version it’s paul krugman playing capt kirk badly demanding that ben bernanke provide even more qe and congress more stimulus spending i should note that paul krugman like myself is a science fiction aficionado that may be the one philosophical point a singularity if you will that we agree on of course the republicans romney are playing the part of scotty yelling back at kirk “captain i cannot give ye any more power the engines are going to blow” the deficit has to be controlled of course to continue on the current path will only feed our black hole of debt even more “mass” making it that much harder to escape from but to try and power away cutting the deficit radically all at once will blow the engines of the economy suddenly reducing the deficit by  of gdp either by cutting spending or raising taxes is a prescription for an almost immediate depression it’s just basic math as i outline in my book endgame shameless plug each country has to find its own path but it’s clear that spain like greece is simply going to have to default on part of its debt so will ireland and portugal japan will resort to printing money in amounts that will boggle the imagination and terrify the world as they finally come to grips with the fact that they must deal with their deficit spending the glide path the us still has the chance to pursue what i call the “glide path” option we can reduce the deficit slowly by say  a year while aggressively pursuing organic growth policies such as unleashing the energy and biotechnology sectors providing certainty to small businesses about government healthcare policies reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses and encouraging new business startups creating a competitive corporate tax environment a much lower corporate tax with no deductions for anything including oildepletion allowances implementing a progrowth tax policy etc we can balance the budget within five years if the bond market perceived that the us was clearly committed to a balanced budget rates would remain low the dollar would be stronger and we would steam away from the black hole i would like to see something like simpsonbowles with an even more radically restructured tax policy healthcare is clearly the challenge but a compromise can be crafted as has been demonstrated by the several bipartisan proposals that have been sponsored by conservative republicans and liberal democrats the key word is compromise the crucial outcome in the wake of the upcoming election will not be whether we end up with a republican or a democratic budget but whether we can achieve the compromise that will be needed to get us on a glide path to a balanced budget if a compromise is not crafted in  how will one be crafted in  which is an election year  may be too late as the bond market will watch europe and japan implode and wonder why the us is any different remember the event horizon is determined by the confidence of the bond market in the willingness and ability of a country to pay its debts with a currency that has a value that can be maintained trilliondollar deficits for the next three years will call into question the value of the dollar that will mean higher interest rates which will mean a much bigger more deadly black hole i should note that something similar to the glide path was tried during the clinton administration spending growth was controlled and the economy was allowed to grow its way out of debt while the us economy is fundamentally weaker today than it was then it should be possible for the us freemarket economy to once again become an engine of growth i think the analogy of an economic singularity is a good one the black hole of debt simply overwhelms the ability of current economic theories to craft solutions based on past performance each country will have to find its own unique way to achieve escape velocity from its own particular black hole that can be through a combination of reducing the debt the size of the black hole and fostering growth even countries that do not have such a problem will have to deal with the black holes in their vicinity as an example finland is part of the eurozone and finds itself gravitationally affected by the black holes of debt created by its fellow eurozone members and china has recently seen its exports to europe drop by almost  i would imagine that has been more or less the experience of most countries that export to europe in science fiction novels a spaceship’s straying too close to a black hole typically results in no spaceship there are also hundreds of examples of what happens to nations that drift too close to the black hole of debt none of the instances are pretty they all end in tears for countries that have been trapped in the gravity well of debt there is only the pain that comes with restructuring it is all too sad   the road to a new medical order october   there is no doubt that the single most contentious topic i can bring up in a small group discussion or speech is the affordable care act otherwise known as obamacare you can feel the tension rise as everyone has an opinion they want to express – most of them based essentially on preconceived philosophical positions nearly all of which are seen through their own eyes as reasonable and consistent with civilized behavior and the facts that can be trotted out to support their positions pro and con could fill up a document almost as long as the original  page bill i have avoided writing about the affordable care act aca for a variety of reasons but primarily because it is so difficult for us to get our heads around the economic implications today i will try though some of my readers may conclude that i have failed to avoid coming to political conclusions about the aca instead i will aim to dwell simply on the economic ramifications of the implementation of the bill as it exists today we are changing the plumbing on  of the us gdp in profound ways many if not most of the changes are absolutely necessary this letter has grown out of a rather lengthy ongoing conversation i have had with my very close friend and personal doctor mike roizen about his perceptions of changes that his institution the cleveland clinic and others like it have to make concerning the delivery of medicine in the near future and the clinics expectations regarding the income they will receive for providing their services… i asked mike if he would be willing to provide me with some notes concerning the future of healthcare in our nation and the clinics own future he kindly obliged and i have edited and expanded upon what he wrote and shared with me in our conversations… we want to make something very clear right at the beginning the us healthcare system as it stands is dysfunctional and can no longer continue as it currently operates with or without obamacare profound change is required to deal with the dysfunctionality and that change will happen one way or another obamacare is simply one method for “encouraging” that necessary change the us currently spends  of its total gdp on health services httpdataworldbankorgindicatorshxpdtotlzs this figure is projected to rise in the near future by about another  due to the population’s aging and a further  due to the growing incidence of chronic illnesses anticipated increases would raise the nation’s healthcare costs to an unsustainable  of gdp crowding out spending for other goods and services by contrast the netherlands spends  of its gdp on healthcare switzerland germany france and canada about  new zealand  sweden  and the united kingdom  as we travel through these countries there is frequently a clear if anecdotal perception that people are healthier than in the us and the data backs up that perception the us spends more money on healthcare because we are in fact far less healthy on average than the rest of the developed world this difference is in large part due to poor lifestyle choices but the good news is there are programs that have clearly and conclusively demonstrated that this difference is reversible changing behavior while it will be difficult can result in significant cost savings in fact changing behavior may allow us to spend more on education social programs and even defense… we are changing the health care plumbing perhaps the best way to illustrate the problem is by means of a rough analogy let’s imagine an older story office building in a big city new office buildings have grown up all around it and the business tenants are beginning to vacate because of the lower rents available to individuals people have started renting space and converting it into apartments but as is typical in office buildings there are very few bathrooms and no showers to speak of so residents rework the plumbing to provide bathroom and kitchen supply water and drains for their living spaces on a small scale it works one floor after another soon converts until the building is now an apartment complex but at some point the plumbing becomes a huge problem not everybody can get enough water at the same time sewage backs up on some floors at inconvenient moments and if someone flushes a toilet someone else gets scalded by hot water in the shower depending solely on where you live in the building you may have access to much better service while others get none because of the plumbing problems resulting from poor infrastructure many of the apartments no longer receive adequate water or get it only on an emergency basis and at great expense and trouble the cost of maintaining the system becomes significant so the residents get together and decide that the building must have a completely new plumbing system no one wants to keep the old plumbing but everyone has a different idea about how to go about creating a new system and what it should accomplish and how much it should cost and who will pay for it do you do one floor at a time all the kitchen sinks at once and can there be different sinks or must one type fit all do you separate the water for the toilets from the potable water in a very contentious vote the occupants of the building narrowly decide on a plan that requires all of the plumbing in the building to be changed simultaneously walls will be knocked out and new pipes and equipment will be installed the new system is going to be a marvel of technology and efficiency but the process has the potential to be very messy as the alltoohuman occupants will be going about their daytoday business in the midst of the construction they will need fresh water and sewage disposal even as the plumbing is being reworked the united states by analogy is changing the plumbing of its healthcare system in describing the plumbing changes we will focus primarily in this letter on the financial aspects and specifically on money flows from patients to providers and from providers to their staffs how do we go about paying the doctors and nurses and covering other hospital costs as it turns out a more efficient system will mean that each apartment hospital will actually get less water money and will have to organize itself to deal with that again the fundamental changes that are necessary in the us healthcare system are going to happen with or without obamacare the system is simply dysfunctional aca is just accelerating the process with a few noncontroversial we hope exceptions we are not going to be making suggestions about what to do to improve the healthcare system or the new healthcare law the following is simply an analysis of the economic and business challenges that will occur as a result of the affordable care act as it is currently understood this is the business reality that hospitals
