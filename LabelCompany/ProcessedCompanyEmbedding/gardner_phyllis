the find link tool for suggestions february  a  woodcut by phyllis gardner of irish wolfhound hy niall phyllis gardner  october  –  february  was a writer artist and noted breeder of irish wolfhounds her and rupert brooke had on her side at least a passionate relationship she attended the slade school of fine art and was a suffragette when they met their conflicting politics and his conflicted feelings led the relationship to end biographyedit gardner spent some of her early childhood in athens where her father professor ernest arthur gardner was director of the british school of archaeology the gardner family which consisted of mary phylliss mother delphis her sister and christopher her brother moved according to professor gardners career they settled in tadworth surrey in a large house called farm corner which was situated close to the surrey hills gardner attended the progressive saint felix school in southwold suffolk between  in  gardner enrolled at the slade school of fine art and specialised in the craft of wood carving but also had a fondness for drawing and painting animals she exhibited a screen and wood carvings at the arts and crafts society eleventh exhibition in  in later years phyllis and delphis carved intricate chess sets one of which forms part of the metropolitan museum collection gardner spotted the figure of rupert brooke in a tearoom in kings cross station in  and phyllis her mother and brooke shared a train compartment on their journey to cambridge during the journey gardner felt compelled to sketch a likeness of brooke and upon arrival in cambridge gardner was determined to discover who this young blonde haired man was and how she could meet him gardners memoir about her relationship with brooke along with their letters to one another were deposited by delphis in the british library in  and closed to access for  years due to the subjected closure period of the collection and the secretive way brooke referred to gardner in his own letters the importance of their relationship was not acknowledged in preceding biographies of brooke in which gardner hardly gets a mention at all brookes letters to gardner depict a cruel side which his literary executor edward marsh tried to hide indeed brookes circle felt that marshs depiction of a exemplary young man cut down in his prime was a misleading portrayal of a more complex figure after brookes death in  gardner devoted her time to a local hospital which treated soldiers from the front gardner found it difficult to cope with the loss of brooke and found the hospital a welcome distraction in later life her family successfully bred irish wolfhounds and opened a kennel called coolafin in maidenhead gardner wrote a well regarded history of the breed and also produced illustrations for the volume herself referencesedit  the rupert brooke society  secret memoir uncovers the real life and loves of doomed war poet rupert brooke  in the guardian  lorna c beckett  the

criminal court judges the authority to jail persons on contempt and the process is outlined in the rules of proceedure  activist moses was denied bail attorney and phone calls when placed in shelby county sheriff custody       while in shelby county sheriffs custody moses was severely injured and sustained head neck and significant permanent injuries officers forcibly removed her from the regional medical center and denied her medical treatment   moses was denied a due process hearing and bond gardner used outdated writs to have moses illegally confined against chief jailers objections  gardner then placed indefinite holds in the court and jail computer system to keep moses hidden and falsely imprisoned  gardner then took vacation where no other judge could draft an order for her to be released from jail the commercial appeal covered a story regarding gardners continual absences from the bench it is a fact moses is not the st person to be officially oppressed by this corrupt
