important west coast plant was located at coos bay coos county oregon from  to  the company founder edward steptoe evans was a selfmade man who had worked as a printer a store clerk a cowhand a librarian and an author when finally at age thirtyfive he developed a product that made him a fortune  in  he created the evans block a small wooden device that made loading and shipping automobiles by rail more efficient  evanss involvement in the car industry led him naturally to produce another product for the automobile battery separators dozens of thin shields were needed to separate the numerous positive and negative plates inside storage batteries while allowing for the flow of the battery acids evanss research and development personnel found that port orford cedar was an ideal material for these separators evans opened a manufacturing plant on coos bay in  near the convergence of the coalbank and isthmus sloughs in order to be near the best stands of port orford cedar at various times evans products operations were also located in gold beach lebanon corvallis winchester and portland with the onset of world war ii battery separators for military vehicles tanks and submarines were in high demand and the coos bay plant produced over  million separators in  alone the heyday of operations was in the early s when over  laborers with an annual payroll of over three million dollars found work at the coos bay plant even during the great depression evans had hundreds of women workers in an industry that was traditionally male known as lumber jinneys a spinoff of the familiar term lumber jack these women predated the familiar rosie the riveter by at least a decade the evans company had a reputation for innovation and diversification besides battery separators it produced railroad ties fence posts and broom sticks in the s it also was the leading producer of high quality port orford cedar venetian blinds upon his fathers death in  edward s evans jr headed the company and continued with new product lines in response to the need for postwar housing the evans company manufactured lumber for prefabricated homes using  feet of fir lumber for framing wall panels cupboards and shelves the company claimed it could complete an evans house on a poured foundation in fortyeight hours by the s the company was an important producer of plywood it developed wooden stadium seats that were installed in the newly constructed marshfield high school gym and made high quality wooden furniture one author claims that the term wood products came into common use in the s and s as a result of the companys prominence the evans products company plant closed its doors in coos bay in the spring of  newspaper editorials at the time speculated the closure was due to the growing scarcity of port orford cedar increased foreign competition and the creation of other materials that replaced traditional wood products after a failed attempt to restart the business the city of coos bay burned the old evans buildings in  a section of highway  near the old plant site was designated evans boulevard one of the few reminders of this once important coos bay business

available search go nov   by ingrid evans  share california variable annuity attorney kickbacks attorney newsletter commissions and kickbacks in the annuity market an oftquoted truism in the financial industry is that some products are “sold not bought” this is especially true of annuities a type of product that often seems to provide more of a benefit to the ¬¬company than to the consumer in recent years the annuity has changed from a rocksolid financial product that promised guaranteed returns based on treasury bonds into a host of diverse complex and feeladen products that promise market rate returns with “no risk” a red flag for investors since few retirees looking for financial security are likely to seek out a “variable” “indexed” “hybrid” or other annuity type insurance companies rely on their broker to explain the dubious virtues of these products and to convince their brokers to sell them insurance companies offer high commissions and lavish gifts including ipads cruises and vacations to exotic pacific islands this side of the annuity industry was the topic of a report issued by senator elizabeth warren which documented the tactics that insurance companies and marketing companies were using to reward brokers who sold the largest number of these highpriced policies our california variable annuity attorneys have investigated many of these policies which notably refrain from mentioning the financial rewards the broker receives for selling them which can be as much as  of the total sale price in addition the practice of lavishing nonmonetary gifts on high producers is not something that insurance companies tend to publicize variable annuities indexed annuities and numerous other varieties sold throughout california have any number of flaws that might end up harming seniors and retirees often they contain surrender charges liquidity fees management fees and other costs and rules that are hidden in the  page contract that policyholders have to sign while it is the broker’s job to explain the policy to the client the aforementioned rewards aren’t likely to induce them to be forthcoming about potential problems with the policy or to recommend less lucrative alternatives in response to this problem a new department of labor rule requires that brokers who earn commissions on annuity sales have to assume a fiduciary responsibility to their client essentially this requires that they act in their clients best financial interest while many consumers have be surprised to learn that brokers weren’t already required to do that many annuity brokers and insurance companies in california and throughout the country are fighting back against this rule either by suspending annuity sales working around commissions or drafting new language into their contract hopefully a few are actually going to improve training and reduce sales pressure on their brokers to ensure that they can meet the demands of fiduciary responsibility some of the major
