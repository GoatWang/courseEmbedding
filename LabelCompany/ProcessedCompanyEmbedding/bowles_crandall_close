anymore bowles and the close family cashed out most of its equity in springs global this year as the company went public in a  million brazilian stock offering the family kept only  of the textile giant that was founded in  in fort mill by bowles greatgreat grandfather samuel elliott white and great grandfather leroy springs enlarge crandall bowles bowles resigned from her position as cochief executive at springs global handing power to her brazilian partner josue christiano gomes da silva in the current stock offering my family will sell a significant portion of our springs global holdings i will continue to serve on the board of springs global bowles said in july i will leave knowing that our company has survived radical change and emerged with solid market value i have great confidence in my coceo and successor josue gomes and the rest of the management team the process that led to bowles departure started in january  when springs industries inc merged with brazilian textile giant coteminas forming springs global the merger combined springs sheet and towel operations with coteminas fabric production making the consolidated company the worlds largest homefurnishings manufacturer in the end the merger that formed springs global us put the company in a position to survive the dramatic decline of the us textile industry industry analysts say what did springs get out of the deal the lowcost production capabilities of its brazilian partner coteminas bowles had become the fifth generation of the springs family to run the company in  she served  years as chief executive of an independent springs industries at the time of her appointment industry watchers speculated that she was brought in to make the tough decisions cutting jobs and closing plants as the nation in  saw an end to the international textile quota system which had limited imports from lowwage countries when the nations borders were thrown open to inexpensive hometextile imports springs pillowtex corp jp stevens and other us textile companies couldnt compete in the first of bowless strategies to stay afloat in a sea of inexpensive homefashion textile imports the family formed a partnership with an investment fund to take the company private springs formed its first alliance with coteminas in  as more production moved off shore springs global began rapidly shuttering us plants starting in  with the closing of the lyman plant in lyman sc and the wamsutta plant in anderson sc eliminating  jobs it concluded with the end of all manufacturing in its home state in  as production was halted at the grace plant in lancaster and the close plant in fort lawn the closing of these plants reflects the global nature of the textile industry which has made us textile manufacturing uncompetitive bowles said in a prepared statement at the time the final closings were announced though inevitable for the company this move is a sad and difficult one for my family and the people and communities involved we would like to express our deepest appreciation to all the associates for their years of commitment and productive efforts for this company in between was the loss of  jobs at the frances and elliott plants in fort lawn and the katherine plant in chester in  springs employed  in south carolina now  springs global workers remain in south carolina mostly at distribution centers in fort lawn and lancaster and at the former springs industries headquarters in fort mill although she remains on the springs global board bowles has started a parttime post as a senior advisor to the nc department of commerce her job is to monitor nc businesses competitiveness in various industry sectors bowless husband former charlotte investment banker erskine bowles is the president of the campus unc system despite bowles and the close familys virtual departure from springs global both will be forever linked to the fort mill area where family land holdings count in the thousands of acres on plus acres between interstate  and the catawba river the family built a successful neotraditional neighborhood called the village of baxter it was one a series of villages

recently discussed the challenges of leadership as part of the leaders in action speakers series at queens university of charlottes mccoll graduate school of business edited excerpts of an interview afterward follow what kinds of leaders were your father and grandfather most leaders end up being strong one way or another both started working in the plants my grandfather being the founder knew everything about the business he was very visionary in where he saw the company going he also had a group of men who he relied on my father had an expanded group of people he worked with and was more relationshiporiented he was a better delegator i would say he understood where the company was going and had the opportunity to expand in the s he took the company public he also had the courage to bring in the first outsider peter scotese to serve as president he brought the company more into the modern corporate world i once read that your first job was at the peach stand a market and restaurant in fort mill did you learn anything there about working with people that serves you today i made  cents an hour i certainly learned the discipline of knowing to be on time its more about dealing with different people than anything else its part of a process that teaches you that the customer is always right how do you describe your leadership style my leadership style has evolved its collaborative i came into the textile business later in my career there were people who knew more about the business and i rely more on their experience and judgment i bring a logic and a willingness to challenge preconceived notions and the way things have always been done ive had to lead through tremendous change in the industry at queens i talked about leading a company through a transition that had a lot of difficult or negative connotations for the people that are working in this area do you feel there are unique leadership skills that are required in the textile industry have the skills you use changed as the industry has changed you have to be willing to change you get kind of dragged along and you cant be in denial you have to be willing to see that things have to change and cant operate in the same way your husband is a prominent leader as well do you ever discuss leadership strategies at home not really he has a different approach and one thats objective we talk about being on different boards hes got a lot of leadership opportunities and is following two very strong leaders as unc system president dick spangler and bill friday bizspace spotlight sponsor listing
