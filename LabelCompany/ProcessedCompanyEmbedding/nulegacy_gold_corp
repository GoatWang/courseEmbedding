returned assays of  gramstonne of gold including  meters  feet of  gramstonne gold and including  meters  feet of  gramstonne gold this new discovery is hosted in a long interval of the very favorable horse canyon formation located in a northwest striking crossfaulted structure location link both of which are classic characteristics of the major gold deposits of the corteztrend such as the neighboring goldrush cortez hills and pipeline deposits said derick unger chief geologist for nulegacy gold the target drilled in in is at the structural intersection of the eastwest striking long

western slope faultanomaly some  meters further west  reported july   was identified in gravimetric and magnetic geophysics surveys and confirmed by recent csamt geophysics surveys nulegacy will promptly locate and drill several followup holes to better assess the magnitude of this discovery  as stated in our nr of feb   nulegacys objectives for the springsummer exploration program has been drilling wildcat holes into several remote possibly high impact targets as well as conducting extensive geophysical and geochemical surveys throughout the sq km sq mile red hill property to find additional gold deposits beyond the iceberg this new discovery is one of the results of that ongoing effort wildcat drilling of geophysical andor geochemically generated targets throughout our square km property continues additional significant results will be released as they are received drilling to further define and expand the gold content of the iceberg gold deposit will resume in the fall about nulegacy gold corporation nulegacy is a nevada exploration company focused on discovering additional carlinstyle gold deposits on its premier district scale sq km  sq mile red hill project in the prolific cortez gold trend of nevada to date nulegacy has discovered the icebergi and the avocado carlinstyle gold deposits and has identified four more highly prospective exploration targets that are being drilled this year nulegacys red hill project is located on trend and adjacentiii to three multimillion ounce carlintype gold deposits the pipeline cortez hills and goldrush deposits that are amongst barrick golds largest lowest cost and politically safest gold minesiii sampling methodology chain of custody quality control and quality assurance all sampling was conducted under the supervision of the companys project geologists and the chain of custody from the project to the sample preparation facility was continuously monitored a blank or certified reference material was inserted approximately every th sample the samples were delivered to american assay labs preparation facility in sparks nv the samples were crushed pulverized and sample pulps were analysed by american assay labs certified laboratory in sparks nv pulps were digested and analyzed for gold using fire assay fusion and an atomic absorption spectroscopy aas finish on a  gram split all other elements were determined by icp analysis data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results the reported intercepts are not necessarily true widths as there is insufficient data at this time with respect to the shape of the mineralization to calculate its true orientation i an established exploration target of  million tonnes of  to  grams of gold per tonne these figures are conceptual in nature and derived from a compilation of  historic and  nulegacy drill holes to date there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource ii the similarity and proximity of these deposits in the cortez trend is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in nulegacys red hill project iii as extracted from barricks q
