obrien march   bob huret and his wife emerson trustee judy huret ma  are pictured at the entrance of a garden at emerson los angeles that was named in their honor in february photo by michelle kwong  faculty members sam binkley and robert todd have been named recipients of this year’s judy and bob huret faculty excellence award which supports tenured faculty research creative projects and innovative pedagogies “my commitment to emerson is first and foremost to the faculty” said emerson trustee judy huret ma ’ who makes the generous award possible “if we didn’t have great faculty we wouldn’t attract great students “our product really is to graduate students who shape the world based on their experiences at emerson” said huret a trustee since  who obtained her master’s degree from emerson in communication sciences and disorders huret vice chairperson of investment firm huret rothenberg and co has enjoyed a successful career that has encompassed management consulting private investing and work in the field of communication disorders including clinical therapy the judy and bob huret faculty excellence award is a reimagined version of the huret faculty development award the former award provided nontenured faculty with funds to complete creative and scholarly work toward attaining tenure the new award is targeted toward tenured faculty—specifically associate professors—who are working on career advancement “our goal is to encourage more senior faculty to move toward full professorships which would be more akin with other colleges” huret said binkley an associate professor in the institute for liberal arts and interdisciplinary studies who focuses on sociology and cultural studies is using his award to write his third book antiracism as a way of life diversity and multiculturalism as conduct and counterconduct based on three articles under review the book will investigate how the questions of race either as racism or antiracism create specific forms of selfinquiry todd an associate professor and associate chair in the visual and media arts department will use his award to begin production on his featurelength film matter with many awardwinning short films in his portfolio this award allows todd to create a film that according to todd “sets up analogies between the intricacies of organic life and those of complex inorganic elemental structures such as ice sandstone formations natural and manmade sources of fire and air currents” that will be shown on film “the deans and i are very grateful for judy and bob’s longstanding support of our faculty and their scholarship research and creative work” said michaele whelan chief academic officer “we see their new award as pivotal to faculty career advancement at emerson the potential impact of this faculty excellence award over time is transformational” huret has provided generous gifts to emerson college over the years including funding toward the harry l huret and ellen marr spector gallery in  she and her husband bob recently had an entry garden at the new emerson college los angeles named in their honor judy huret recalls enrolling at emerson as a graduate student in the late s “i’ll never forget how the head of the communication disorders department sat down with me on these childsized chairs in the thayer lindsley nursery to look at me eyetoeye” she said “it was quintessential emerson it was a personalized intimate meaningful interaction “i was exposed to worldclass faculty in the classroom and my internship was of such high quality” huret continued “i felt it was incredible and i wanted to make that opportunity happen for others” faculty may find more information on internal grant programs through the office of research

just blow us away of the wine access clients who have devoured this  vintage   have rated it a perfect  stars luckily eric titus gave us one last allocation but when these  cases are gone so is this valuestunner from parker’s “game changer” vintage  we’ve known phil titus for  years and his marine biologist brother eric for a decade the story of their father lee is a piece of st helena folklore lee was drawn to napa valley by his north beachbred wife ruth traverso the daughter of italian immigrants when lee finally started purchasing vineyard property west of the silverado trail in  few napa valley growers understood what to plant on the rocky volcanic soils of st helena his land was planted to obscure grapes like mondeuse burger and golden chasselas in a farsighted decision that would pay massive dividends lee replaced those alpine varieties with bordeaux grapes everything changed phil and eric run titus now producing wines exclusively from their st helena vineyards not surprisingly the dry and steady conditions that produced robert parker’s “greatest vintage in  years” were incredibly kind to the bordeaux varieties planted on the titus estate the result is a gentle beast of a wine that has to be tasted to be believed tasting notes  titus andronicus proprietary red wine access dark inky and powerful this voluptuous bordeaux blend features gorgeous aromas of crushed black fruits black cherry graphite and tobacco terrifically concentrated dense and almost chewy in texture the core is just packed with black fruit and mountain blueberry preserves even as the
