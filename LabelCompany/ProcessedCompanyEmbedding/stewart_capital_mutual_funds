proposed that this filing will become effective check appropriate box    immediately upon filing pursuant to paragraph b x on may   pursuant to paragraph b     days after filing pursuant to paragraph a    on date pursuant to paragraph a     days after filing pursuant to paragraph a    on date pursuant to paragraph a of rule  if appropriate check the following box    this posteffective amendment designates a new effective date for a previously filed post effective amendment                  fund summary   investment objective   the stewart capital mid cap fund the “fund” seeks longterm capital appreciation   fund fees and expenses   this table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund   annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment management fees  distribution andor service b fees  other expenses  acquired fund fees and expenses   total annual fund operating expenses  expense reductionreimbursement   total annual fund operating expenses after expense reductionreimbursement     the operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio in the fund’s financial highlights because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the fund  the fund’s adviser has contractually agreed to reduce fees and absorb expenses of the fund until april   to ensure that total annual operating expenses of the fund do not exceed  of the fund’s average net assets exclusive of interest taxes transaction costs such as brokerage commissions and expenses relating to dividends on short sales acquired fund fees and expenses fees and expenses of any counsel or other persons or services retained by the fund’s independent trustees or extraordinary or nonrecurring fund expenses including but not limited to litigation and indemnification costs expenses of any reorganization restructuring or merger of the fund or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of another fund expenses associated with special meetings of fund shareholders expenses of converting to a new custodian transfer agent or other service provider or any other expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the fund’s business the agreement may be terminated by the fund’s board of trustees on  days’ written notice to the adviser   example   this example is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be   one year three years five years ten years                portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover may result in higher transaction costs and higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund’s performance during the most recent fiscal year the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio   principal investment strategies   under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus borrowings in equity securities of midcapitalization companies the equity securities in which the fund invests consist primarily of common stock for these purposes “midcapitalization companies” are those that at the time of purchase have market capitalizations that fall within the market capitalization range of companies within the russell midcap® value index as of february   market capitalizations of companies in the russell midcap® value index ranged from approximately  million to  billion with an average market capitalization of  billion   the fund typically invests in  to  companies whose stock prices the adviser believes are lower than the actual value of the companies in analyzing value the adviser focuses on whether the stock prices of these companies are priced at a discount to the present values of their future cash flows   the adviser prefers to invest in companies that do not need to rely on large amounts of leverage to execute their business plans in selecting investments the adviser uses a number of criteria including but not limited to   ■ industries and companies with high barriers to entry   ■ industries and companies with high returns on invested capital   ■ industries and companies with favorable demographics   ■ industries and companies participating in major longterm trends and   ■ companies with strong management teams   the fund will invest in foreign companies that are traded on a us exchange and through depositary receipts depositary receipts which can include american depositary receipts “adrs” represent ownership of securities in foreign companies and are held in banks and trust companies   the fund may sell securities for a variety of reasons such as to secure gains limit losses or redeploy assets into more promising opportunities              principal risks   the fund is designed for investors seeking capital appreciation in their investment over the longterm those investors should be willing to assume the risks of share price fluctuations that are typical for a fund focusing on equity investments the fund is not a complete investment program there is no assurance the fund will achieve its investment objective and the loss of your money is a risk of investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency   market risk   this is the risk that the value of the fund’s investments will fluctuate as the stock or bond markets fluctuate and that prices overall will decline over short or longterm periods   focused portfolio risk although the fund is a diversified fund because the fund invests in a limited number of companies it may have more risk because changes in the value of a single security may have a more significant effect either negative or positive on the fund’s net asset value   mid cap risk the fund invests primarily in undervalued midcap stocks and therefore is subject to the possibility that value stocks or midcap stocks may temporarily fall out of favor or perform poorly relative to other types of investments   management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio the adviser will apply its investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund but there is no guarantee that its decisions will produce the intended result and there can be no assurance that the fund’s investment objective will be achieved   allocation risk this is the risk that the allocation of the fund’s investments among economic sectors may have a more significant effect on the fund’s net asset value when one of these sectors is performing more poorly than the others   foreign investment risk foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic

investment objective investment strategies and related risks   this section of the prospectus provides a description of the fund’s investment objective principal strategies and risks there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective and an investor may lose money by investing in this fund except as noted i the fund’s investment objective is “fundamental” and cannot be changed without a shareholder vote and ii the fund’s investment policies are not fundamental and thus can be changed without a shareholder vote where an investment policy or restriction has a percentage limitation such limitation is applied at the time of investment generally changes in the market value of securities in the fund’s portfolio after they are purchased by the fund will not cause the fund to be in violation of such limitation   investment objective   the fund’s investment objective is longterm capital appreciation the fund’s board of trustees may not change this objective without shareholder approval   principal investment strategies   under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its total assets in equity securities of midcapitalization companies the equity securities in which the fund invests consist primarily of common stock equity securities of midcapitalization companies in which the fund invests include common stocks publiclytraded units of master limited partnerships mlps securities convertible into common or preferred stocks such as convertible bonds and debentures options on common stocks and trust units ie real estate income trust units royalty trust units etc and other securities with equity characteristics for these purposes “midcapitalization companies” are those that at the time of purchase have market capitalizations that fall within the market capitalization range of companies within the russell midcap® value index this index measures the performance of the  smallest companies in the russell ® index which is made up of the  largest us companies based on total market capitalization as of february   market capitalizations of companies in the russell midcap® value index ranged from approximately  million to  billion with an average market capitalization of  billion the range of market capitalizations of companies in the russell midcap® value index will change from time to time to the extent that at the time of investment a company’s market capitalization falls within the range in effect at that time the investment will be considered within the  limitation if after the initial investment the company’s market capitalization falls outside of the range as adjusted from time to time subsequent purchases will not be considered within the  limitation but still may be made to the extent fund has capacity with respect to the remaining  of its net assets the fund’s policy of investing at least  of its net assets in equity securities of midcapitalization companies may be changed only upon  days’ notice to shareholders              the fund typically invests in  to  companies whose stock prices the adviser believes are lower than the actual value of the companies in analyzing value the adviser focuses on whether the stock prices of these companies are priced at a discount to the present values of their future cash flows it is the fund’s policy not to concentrate its investments in one industry or groups of related industries   the adviser prefers to invest in those companies that do not need to rely on large amounts of leverage to execute their business plans in selecting investments the adviser uses a number of criteria including but not limited to   ■ industries and companies with high barriers to entry   ■ industries and companies with high returns on invested capital   ■ industries and companies with favorable demographics   ■ industries and companies participating in major longterm trends and   ■ companies with strong management teams   in pursuing the fund’s investment objective the adviser has the discretion to purchase some securities that do not meet its normal criteria as described above when it perceives an unusual opportunity for gain these special situations could arise when the adviser believes a security has the potential to increase in value for a variety of reasons including a change of management an extraordinary corporate event or a temporary imbalance in the supply of or demand for the securities   the fund will invest in foreign companies that are traded on a us exchange and through depositary receipts depositary receipts represent ownership of securities in foreign companies and are held in banks and trust companies they can include adrs which are traded on us exchanges and are us dollardenominated although adrs do not eliminate the risks inherent in investing in the securities of foreign issuers which include market political currency and regulatory risk by investing in adrs rather than directly in stocks of foreign issuers the fund may avoid currency risks during the settlement period for purchases or sales in general there is a large liquid market in the us for many adrs   the fund may sell securities for a variety of reasons such as to secure gains limit losses or redeploy assets into more promising opportunities   principal risks   market risk this is the risk that the value of the fund’s investments will fluctuate as the stock or bond markets fluctuate and that prices overall will decline over short or longterm periods   focused portfolio risk although the fund is a diversified fund because the fund invests in a limited number of companies it may have more risk because changes in the value of a single security may have a more significant effect either negative or positive on the fund’s net asset value   mid cap risk the fund invests primarily in undervalued midcap stocks and therefore is subject to the possibility that value stocks or midcap stocks may temporarily fall out of favor or perform poorly relative to other types of investments with value investing there is the risk that the market will not              recognize that the securities selected are undervalued and they might not appreciate in value in the way the adviser anticipates while stocks of midcap companies may be slightly less volatile than those of smallcap companies they still involve substantial risk midcap companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and they may be dependent on a limited management group stocks of midcap companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than those of larger more established companies or the market averages in general   management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio the adviser will apply its investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund but there is no guarantee that its decisions will produce the intended result and there can be no assurance that the fund’s investment objective will be achieved   allocation risk this is the risk that the allocation of the fund’s investments among economic sectors may have a more significant effect on the fund’s net asset value when one of these sectors is performing more poorly than the others   foreign investment risk foreign investing involves risks not typically associated with us investments including adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values adverse political social and economic developments less liquidity greater volatility less developed or less efficient trading markets political instability and differing auditing and legal standards investing in emerging markets imposes risks different from or greater than risks of investing in foreign developed countries   value investing risk value investing attempts to identify companies selling at a discount to their intrinsic value value investing is subject to the risk that a company’s intrinsic value may never be fully realized by the market or that a company judged by the adviser to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced   certain nonprincipal investment strategies and techniques and related risks   this section provides information about some investment strategies and techniques that the adviser might use or uses only to a very limited extent the adviser might not use all of the different types of techniques and investments described below you should be aware that the fund may also use strategies and invest in securities that are not described in this prospectus but that are described in the fund’s statement of additional information “sai”   master limited partnerships mlp a mlp is an investment that combines the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publiclytraded securities the risks of investing in a mlp are generally those involved in investing in a partnership as opposed to a corporation for example state law governing partnerships is often less restrictive than state law governing corporations accordingly there may be fewer protections afforded investors in a mlp than investors in a corporation investments held by mlps may be relatively illiquid limiting the mlps’ ability to vary their portfolios promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions mlps may have limited financial resources their securities may trade infrequently and in limited volume and they may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than securities of larger or more broadlybased companies            the fund’s investment in mlps also subjects the fund to the risks associated with the specific industry or industries in which the mlps invest in addition mlps may be subject to state taxation in certain jurisdictions which will have the effect of reducing the amount of income paid by the mlp to its investors additionally since mlps generally conduct business in multiple states the fund may be subject to income or franchise tax in each of the states in which the partnership does business which will have the effect of reducing the amount of income paid by the mlp to its investors the additional cost of preparing and filing the state tax returns and paying the related taxes may adversely impact the fund’s return on its investment in mlps   convertible securities convertible securities are hybrid securities that combine the investment characteristics of bonds and common stocks convertible securities typically consist of debt securities or preferred stock that may be converted within a specified period of time typically for the entire life of the security into a certain amount of common stock or other equity security of the same or a different issuer at a predetermined price convertible securities entitle the holder to receive interest paid or accrued on debt or dividends paid or accrued on preferred stock until the security matures or is redeemed converted or exchanged the market value of a convertible security generally is a function of its “investment value” and its “conversion value” a security’s “investment value” represents the value of the security without its conversion feature ie a comparable nonconvertible fixedincome security at any given time investment value is dependent upon such factors as the general level of interest rates the yield of similar nonconvertible securities the financial strength of the issuer and the seniority of the security in the issuer’s capital structure a security’s “conversion value” is determined by multiplying the number of shares the holder is entitled to receive upon conversion or exchange by the current price of the underlying security if the conversion value of a convertible security is significantly below its investment value the convertible security’s market value will not be influenced greatly by fluctuations in the market price of the underlying security into which it can be converted instead the convertible security’s price will tend to move in the opposite direction from interest rates conversely if the conversion value of a convertible security is significantly above its investment value the market value of the convertible security will be more heavily influenced by fluctuations in the market price of the underlying stock in that case the convertible security’s price may be as volatile as that of the common stock   illiquid securities these securities include private placements that are sold directly to a small number of investors usually institutions unlike public offerings such securities are not registered with the sec although certain of these securities may be readily sold for example under rule a others may have resale restrictions and be illiquid the sale of illiquid securities may involve substantial delays and additional costs and the fund may only be able to sell such securities at prices substantially less than what the fund believes they are worth the fund will not invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities   temporary defensive investments  from time to time for temporary defensive purposes to attempt to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions the fund may reduce its position in equity securities and invest in without limitation certain types of shortterm liquid highgrade or highquality debt securities “highgrade or highquality debt securities” generally consist of bonds rated “a” or higher by moody’s sp or fitch or if unrated for purposes of the fund’s investment            policies securities as may be determined by the adviser to be of equivalent quality securities the fund may invest in for temporary defensive purposes may include us government securities qualifying bank deposits money market instruments prime commercial paper and other types of shortterm debt securities including notes and bonds while the fund is investing for temporary defensive purposes it may not meet its investment objective   disclosure of portfolio holdings   the fund’s portfolio holdings are included in semiannual and annual reports that are distributed to

professionals   pricing of fund shares   the price for fund shares is the net asset value “nav” per share the nav is determined at the close of regular trading hours normally  pm eastern time of the new york stock exchange “nyse” each day the nyse is open it is not calculated on days the nyse is closed for trading the nyse is open for trading monday through friday except new year’s day dr martin luther king jr day president’s day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day additionally if any of the aforementioned holidays falls on a saturday the nyse will not be open for trading on the preceding friday and when any such holiday falls on a sunday the nyse will not be open for trading on the succeeding monday unless unusual business conditions exist such as the ending of a monthly or the yearly accounting period your purchase and redemption requests are priced at the next nav calculated after receipt of a properly completed purchase or redemption request the nav per share is determined by dividing the total value of the fund’s securities and other assets less its liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding   the fund uses the following methods to value securities held in its portfolio   ■ securities listed on us stock exchanges or the nasdaq® stock market are valued at the last sale price on such market or if such a price is lacking for the trading period immediately preceding the time of determination such securities are valued at their current bid price   ■ securities that are traded in the overthecounter market are valued at their current bid price   ■ shortterm investments may be valued using amortized cost which approximates fair value and   ■ securities for which market quotations are not readily available shall be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the fund’s board of trustees   the market value of the securities in the fund’s portfolio changes daily and the nav of fund shares changes accordingly              fair value pricing   the fund normally invests in common stock of domestic issuers listed on the nyse or the nasdaq® stock market the substantial majority of which are midcapitalization highly liquid securities nonetheless these securities may at times not have market quotations readily available including but not limited to such instances where the market quotation for a security has become stale sales of a security have been infrequent or where there is a thin market in the security to address these situations the board of trustees has adopted and approved a fair value pricing policy for the fund when a security is fair valued it is priced at the amount that the owner of the security might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale   because fair value pricing is subjective in nature there can be no assurance that the fund could purchase or sell a portfolio security at the price used to calculate the fund’s nav there can be significant deviations between a fair value price at which a portfolio security is being carried and the price at which it is purchased or sold furthermore changes in the fair valuation of portfolio securities may be less frequent and of greater magnitude than changes in the price of portfolio securities valued using market quotations   the fund’s board of trustees reviews

shares if in its opinion such action would prevent the fund from becoming a personal holding company as defined in the internal revenue code   market timing   the fund is designed for longterm investors the fund discourages and does not accommodate frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares referred to as “market timing” investors who engage in market timing may dilute the value of fund shares interfere with the efficient management of the fund’s portfolio and increase the fund’s brokerage and administrative costs management of the fund believes that its investment strategy is not attractive to market timing investors because its portfolio holdings are primarily of domestic issuers which eliminates “timezone arbitrage” that may be associated with funds having significant holdings in foreign securities traded on foreign exchanges “timezone arbitrage” involves attempts by investors to take advantage of the differences              in value of foreign securities that might result from events that occur after the close of the foreign securities markets on which a foreign security is traded and the nyse that day when the fund’s nav is calculated in addition the fund invests primarily in midcap companies that historically have exhibited a relatively low level of the shortterm volatility usually sought by market timing investors as a result the fund does not currently impose redemption fees on fund shareholders   in an effort to discourage market timing the fund’s board of trustees has adopted the following policy and related procedures regarding such market timing the fund is not to be used as a vehicle for shortterm trading or market timing and therefore the fund will not honor requests for purchases or exchanges by shareholders who identify themselves as market timers or are identified by the fund as engaging in a pattern of frequent trading potentially injurious to the funds “frequent trading potentially injurious to the fund” is defined as a sale of fund shares exceeding a designated monetary threshold within  days of the purchase of such fund shares   the fund reserves the right to restrict reject suspend limit or terminate without prior notice the purchase of fund shares by any investor or any financial intermediary firm who appears to be employing a frequent trading or markettiming strategy or for any other reason   the fund maintains surveillance procedures to detect frequent trading or market timing of fund shares as part of this surveillance process the fund’s agents examine the purchase and subsequent sale of fund shares exceeding the monetary threshold for transactions within a day period to the extent that transactions exceeding the monetary threshold within a day period are identified the fund will place a “block” on the account and may also block the accounts of clients of the particular adviser or broker considered responsible for the trading the fund may modify its surveillance procedures and criteria from time to time without prior notice subject to board of trustees approval as necessary or appropriate to improve the detection of frequent trading or to address specific circumstances in the case of financial intermediaries the application of the surveillance procedures will be subject to the limitations of the intermediaries’ monitoring systems andor ability to provide sufficient information from which to detect patterns of frequent trading potentially injurious to the fund the fund also may consider the history of trading activity in all accounts known to be under common ownership control or influence   management of the fund has determined that certain shortterm purchases and redemptions are not disruptive or harmful to the fund’s longterm shareholders such as transactions conducted through systematic investment or withdrawal plans and therefore such transactions generally are not subject to the surveillance procedures additional exceptions may be granted where extraordinary or unique circumstances indicate that a transaction or series of transactions does not adversely affect the fund or its shareholders and is not part of a frequent trading or markettiming strategy any exceptions are subject to advance approval by the fund’s president and are subject to oversight by the fund’s chief compliance officer and the board of trustees   shareholders are subject to the fund’s policy prohibiting frequent trading or market timing regardless of whether they invest directly with the fund or indirectly through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer a bank an investment advisor or an administrator or trustee of a k retirement plan            that maintains an omnibus account with the fund for trading on behalf of its customers although the fund monitors accounts of financial intermediaries and will seek to require or otherwise encourage financial intermediaries to apply the fund’s policy prohibiting frequent trading or market timing to their customers who invest indirectly in the fund the fund is limited in its ability to monitor the trading activity or enforce the fund’s policy prohibiting frequent trading with respect to customers of financial intermediaries certain financial intermediaries may be limited with respect to their monitoring systems andor their ability to provide sufficient information from which to detect patterns of frequent trading potentially injurious to a fund for example should it occur the fund may not be able to detect frequent trading or market timing that may be facilitated by financial intermediaries or it may be more difficult to identify such trading in the omnibus accounts used by those intermediaries for aggregated purchases exchanges and redemptions on behalf of all their customers in certain circumstances financial intermediaries such as k plan providers may not have the technical capability to apply the fund’s policy prohibiting frequent trading to their customers reasonable efforts will be made to identify the financial intermediary customer engaging in frequent trading transactions placed through the same financial intermediary that violate the policy prohibiting frequent trading may be deemed part of a group for purposes of the fund’s policy and may be rejected in whole or in part by the fund brokers maintaining omnibus accounts with the fund have agreed to provide shareholder transaction information to the extent known to the broker to the fund upon request   confirmations statements and reports   umbfs will send you a confirmation

continue to qualify at all times as a regulated investment company “ric” under subchapter m of the internal revenue code by qualifying as a ric and satisfying certain other requirements the fund will not be subject to federal income or excise taxes to the extent the fund distributes its net investment income and realized capital gains to its shareholders   the tax characteristics of distributions from the fund are the same whether paid in cash or in additional shares for federal income tax purposes distributions of net investment income are taxable as ordinary income to the recipient shareholders and distributions designated as the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss are generally taxable as longterm capital gain to the recipient shareholder regardless of the length of time the shareholder held the fund’s shares in the case of noncorporate shareholders certain dividend distributions may be classified as qualified dividend income taxable

security number or other tax identification number provided is correct and that the prospective shareholder is not subject to a percentage backup withholding for previous underreporting of income to

each share represents a proportionate interest in the fund’s assets all shares have the same voting and other rights and preferences the shares have noncumulative voting rights for elections of members of the board this gives holders of more than  of the shares the ability to elect all of the members of the board if this happens holders of the remaining shares entitled to vote will not be able to elect anyone to the board the fund does not intend to hold annual shareholder meetings and is not required to do so the fund may hold special meetings however for matters requiring shareholder approval a special meeting may also be called by the board and certain officers in their discretion investment strategies and risks generally the policies and restrictions discussed in this sai and in the prospectus apply when the fund makes an investment in most cases the fund is not required to sell a security because circumstances change and the security no longer meets one or more of the fund’s policies or restrictions except in the case of borrowing or illiquid securities if a percentage restriction or limitation is met at the time of investment a later increase or decrease in the percentage due to a change in the value or liquidity of portfolio securities will not be considered a violation of the restriction or limitation if a bankruptcy or other extraordinary event occurs concerning a particular security the fund owns the fund may receive stock real estate or other investments that the fund would not or could not buy if this happens the fund intends to sell such investments as soon as practicable while trying to maximize the return to shareholders the fund has adopted certain investment restrictions as fundamental policies a fundamental policy may only be changed if the change is approved by i more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares or ii  or more of the fund’s shares present at a shareholder meeting if more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares are represented at the meeting in person or by proxy whichever is less the following investment policies and restrictions supplement those set forth above and in the prospectus whenever any investment restriction other than restrictions related to borrowing and to illiquid securities states a maximum percentage of the fund’s assets which may be invested in any security or other asset it is intended that such maximum percentage limitation be determined immediately after and as a result of the fund’s acquisition of such securities or other assets accordingly any later increase or decrease in percentage beyond the specified limitation resulting from a change in values or net assets will not be considered a violation of any such maximum  other investment practices while the fund does not anticipate utilizing them on a regular basis the fund may from time to time employ the following investment practices illiquid securities the fund will limit its investment in illiquid securities to no more than  of fund net assets for this purpose illiquid securities are securities restricted as to disposition under federal securities laws and include among others a direct placements or other securities which are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or for which there is no readily available market eg trading in the security is suspended or in the case of unlisted securities market makers do not exist or will not entertain bids or offers and b repurchase agreements not terminable within seven days securities that have legal or contractual restrictions on resale but have a readily available market are not deemed illiquid for purposes of this limitation this restriction will not apply to securities purchased pursuant to rule a   historically illiquid securities have included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” and securities which are otherwise not readily marketable securities which have not been registered under the securities act are referred to as private placements or restricted securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary market mutual funds do not typically hold a significant amount of these restricted securities or illiquid securities because of the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation limitations on resale may have an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities and a mutual fund might be unable to dispose of restricted securities or illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and may thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days a mutual fund may also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them resulting in additional expense and delay adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities in recent years however a large institutional market has developed for certain securities that are not registered under the securities act including foreign securities institutional investors depend on an efficient institutional market in which the unregistered security can be readily resold or on an issuer’s ability to honor a demand for repayment the fact that there are contractual or legal restrictions on resale to the general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative of the liquidity of such investments rule a under the securities act allows a broader institutional trading market for securities otherwise subject to restriction on resale to the general public rule a establishes a “safe harbor” from the registration requirements of the securities act for resales of certain securities to qualified institutional buyers an insufficient number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing certain restricted securities held by the fund however could affect adversely the marketability of such portfolio securities and the fund might be unable to dispose of such securities promptly or at reasonable prices the adviser acting under the supervision of the board will monitor the liquidity of restricted securities in the fund’s portfolio that are eligible for resale pursuant to rule a in reaching liquidity decisions the adviser will consider among others the following factors  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers making quotations to purchase or sell the security  the number of other potential purchasers of the security  the number of dealers undertaking to make a market in the security  the nature of the security including its unregistered nature and the nature of the marketplace for the security eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer and  any applicable sec interpretation or position with respect to such type of securities  covered options the fund may purchase put and call options on securities stock indices interest rate indices commodity indices andor foreign currencies these transactions will be undertaken only for the purpose of reducing risk to the fund that is for “hedging” purposes the total market value of securities covering call or put options may not exceed  of the fund’s total assets no more than  of the fund’s total assets will be committed to premiums when purchasing call or put options the fund will write options only if they are “covered” in the case of a call option on a security the option is covered if the fund owns the security underlying the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or if additional cash consideration is required cash or other liquid assets in such amount are segregated upon conversion or exchange of the securities held by the fund for a call option on an index or currency the option is covered if the fund segregates liquid assets in an amount equal to the contract value of the index or currency a call option is also covered if the fund holds a call on the same security index or currency as the call written where the exercise price of the call held is i equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or ii greater than the exercise price of the call written provided the difference is maintained by the fund in segregated liquid assets a put option on a security currency or index is covered if the fund segregates liquid assets equal to the exercise price a put option is also covered if the fund holds a put on the same security currency or index as the put written where the exercise price of the put held is i equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put written or ii less than the exercise price of the put written provided the difference is maintained by the fund in segregated liquid assets a straddle will be covered when sufficient assets are deposited to meet the fund’s immediate obligations the fund may use the same liquid assets to cover both the call and put options where the exercise price of the call and put are the same or the exercise price of the call is higher than that of the put in such cases the fund will also segregate liquid assets equivalent to the amount if any by which the put is “in the money” if an option written by the fund expires unexercised the fund realizes a capital gain equal to the premium received at the time the option was written if an option purchased by a fund expires unexercised the fund realizes a capital loss equal to the premium paid prior to the earlier of exercise or expiration an exchange traded option may be closed out by an offsetting purchase or sale of an option of the same series type exchange underlying security currency or index exercise price and expiration there can be no assurance however that a closing purchase or sale transaction can be effected when the fund desires the fund may sell put or call options it has previously purchased which could result in a net gain or loss depending on whether the amount realized on the sale is more or less than the premium and other transaction costs paid on the put or call option which is sold prior to exercise or expiration an option may be closed out by an offsetting purchase or sale of an option of the same series a fund will realize a capital gain from a closing purchase transaction if the cost of the closing option is less than the premium received from writing the option or if it is more the fund will realize a capital loss if the premium received from a closing sale transaction is more than the premium paid to purchase the option the fund will realize a capital gain or if it is less the fund will realize a capital loss the principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand interest rates the current market price of the underlying security currency or index in relation to the exercise price of the option the volatility of the underlying security currency or index and the time remaining until the expiration date the premium paid for a put or call option purchased by the fund is an asset of the fund the premium received for an option written by the fund is recorded as a deferred credit the value of an option purchased or written is marked to market daily and is valued at the closing price on the exchange on which it is traded or if not traded on an exchange or no closing price is available at the mean between the last bid and asked price there are several risks associated with options transactions for example there are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events during the option period the covered call writer has in return for the premium on the option given up the opportunity to profit from a price increase in the underlying security above the exercise price but as long as its obligation as a writer continues has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill it obligations as a writer of the option once an option writer has received an exercise notice it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price if a put or call option purchased by the fund is not sold when it has remaining value and if the market price of the underlying security remains equal to or greater than the exercise price in the case of a put or remains less than or equal to the exercise price in the case of a call the fund will lose its entire investment in the option also where a put or call option on a particular security is purchased to hedge against price movements in a related security the price of the put or call option may move more or less than the price of the related security there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position if the fund were unable to close out an option that it had purchased on a security it would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option may expire worthless if the fund were unable to close out a covered call option that it had written on a security it would not be able to sell the underlying security unless the option expired without exercise if trading were suspended in an option purchased by the fund the fund would not be able to close out the option if restrictions on exercise were imposed the fund might be unable to exercise an option it had purchased except to the extent that a call option on an index written by the fund is covered by an option on the same index purchased by the fund movements in the index may result in a loss to the fund however such losses may be mitigated by changes in the value of the fund’s securities during the period the option was outstanding  stock index futures the fund may purchase and sell stock index futures contracts a stock index assigns relative values to the common stocks comprising the index a stock index futures contract is a bilateral agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of liquid assets equal to a specified dollar amount multiplied by the difference between the stock index value at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the futures contract is originally struck no physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index is made the fund will not purchase and sell options on stock index futures contracts in connection with its purchase of stock index futures contracts the fund will deposit in a segregated account with the fund’s custodian an amount of liquid assets equal to the market value of the futures contracts less any amounts maintained in a margin account with the fund’s broker the fund has claimed an exclusion from the definition of “commodity pool operator” under the commodity exchange act and therefore is not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under that act convertible securities and warrants the fund may invest in debt or preferred equity securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities traditionally convertible securities have paid dividends or interest at rates higher than common stocks but lower than nonconvertible securities they generally participate in the appreciation or depreciation of the underlying stock into which they are convertible but to a lesser degree some convertibles combine higher or lower current income with options and other features warrants are options to buy a stated number of shares of common stock at a specified price anytime during the life of the warrants generally two or more years warrants can be highly volatile have no voting rights and pay no dividends prior to conversion convertible securities have the same general characteristics as nonconvertible debt securities which generally provide a stable stream of income with yields that are generally higher than those of equity securities of the same or similar issuers the price of a convertible security will normally vary with changes in the price of the underlying equity security although the higher yield tends to make the convertible security less volatile than the underlying equity security as with debt securities the market value of convertible securities tends to decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates decline while convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible debt securities of similar quality they offer investors the potential to benefit from increases in the market price of the underlying common stock convertible debt securities that are rated baa or lower by moody’s or bbb or lower by sp or fitch and comparable unrated securities as determined by the adviser may share some or all of the risks of nonconvertible debt securities with those ratings  real estate investment trusts “reits” when deemed appropriate by the adviser the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in securities of reits reits are publicly traded corporations or trusts that specialize in acquiring holding and managing residential commercial or industrial real estate a reit is not taxed at the entity level on income distributed to its shareholders or unit holders if it distributes to shareholders or unit holders at least  of its taxable income for each taxable year and complies with regulatory requirements relating to its organization ownership assets and income equity reits will be affected by changes in the values of and incomes from the properties they own while mortgage reits may be affected by the credit quality of the mortgage loans they hold reits are subject to other risks as well including the fact that reits are dependent on specialized management skills which may affect their ability to generate cash flow for operating purposes and to make distributions to shareholders or unit holders reits may have limited diversification and are subject to the risks associated with obtaining financing for real property a reit can pass its income through to shareholders or unit holders without any tax at the entity level if it complies with various requirements under the internal revenue code there is the risk that a reit held by the fund will fail to qualify for this taxfree passthrough treatment of its income by investing in a reit indirectly through a fund in addition to bearing a proportionate share of the expenses of the fund you will also indirectly bear similar expenses of the reit in which the fund invests lending of portfolio securities the fund may seek to increase income by lending portfolio securities under present regulatory policies such loans are required to be secured continuously by collateral consisting of liquid assets maintained in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned a principal risk in lending portfolio securities as with other collateralized extensions of credit consists of the possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower fail financially in addition the fund will be exposed to the risk that the sale of any collateral realized upon the borrower’s default will not yield proceeds sufficient to replace the loaned securities the fund has the right to call such a loan and obtain the securities loaned or equivalent securities at any time on five days’ notice during the existence of a loan the fund will receive the income earned on investment of the collateral any such investment on collateral will be subject to the fund’s investment risks the

demand of the investment company’s shares on the exchange upon which their shares are traded indexbased investments may not replicate or otherwise match the composition or performance of their specified index due to transaction costs among other things shares of etfs have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds in addition their market value is expected to rise and fall as the value of the underlying index or bond rises and falls the market value of their shares may differ from the net asset value the “nav” of the particular fund as a shareholder in an investment company including an etf the fund would bear its ratable share of that entity’s expenses including its advisory and administration fees at the same time the fund would continue to pay its

statements assistance and consultation in connection with tax matters sec filings and review of the annual income tax returns filed on behalf of the fund portfolio transactions brokerage allocations and other practices as a fiduciary the adviser has an obligation to seek to obtain the best execution of client transactions under the circumstances of the particular transaction generally equity trading orders are processed and executed in the order received the adviser provides investment advisory services to many different types of client accounts certain portfolio management decisions may affect more than one account for example when the adviser decides to take an investment action with respect to all of the accounts they manage this results in multiple trading orders relating to the same security but for different client accounts in these cases the adviser may combine or aggregate purchase or sale orders for more than one client when the adviser believes such aggregation is consistent with its duty to seek best execution such aggregation may be able to reduce commission costs or market impact on a pershare and perdollar basis because larger orders tend to have lower commission costs the decision to aggregate is only made after the adviser determines that it does not intentionally favor any account over another it does not systematically advantage or disadvantage any account the adviser does not receive any additional compensation or remuneration solely as the result of the aggregation and each participating account will receive the average share price and will share pro rata in the transaction costs however there may be occasions when clients may pay disparate transaction costs due to minimum charges per account imposed by either the broker effecting the transaction or the client’s custodian if there is an open order and a subsequent similar order for the same security for a different account is received by the adviser’s trading desk such subsequent order will generally be aggregated with any remainder of the original order consistent with the considerations set forth above  from time to time an aggregated order involving multiple accounts does not receive sufficient securities to fill all of the accounts if an aggregated order cannot be filled in one day a “partial fill” the executed portion of the order is allocated to the participating accounts pro rata on the basis of order size subject to certain exceptions the adviser may determine that an order will not be aggregated with other orders for a number of reasons these reasons may include the account’s governing documents do not permit aggregation a client has directed that trades be executed through a specific brokerdealer aggregation is impractical because of specific trade directions received from the portfolio manager eg a limit order the order involves a different trading strategy or if the adviser otherwise determines that aggregation is not consistent with seeking best execution when the adviser determines that multiple orders cannot be aggregated the adviser has adopted procedures that seek to ensure that client account orders are treated fairly and equitably over time this includes requiring that client order instructions be transmitted to the executing broker at the same time the adviser may use other methods to ensure fair and equitable treatment over time including rotating the execution order of different categories aggregated client orders from time to time the adviser places overthecounter “otc” transactions with a broker which executes the trade as an agent rather than as a marketmaker in the security the adviser will retain a broker on an otc trade when the adviser cannot trade directly with a marketmaker or if it is justified under the circumstances and will result in the best price on the trade to make this determination the adviser will contact several sources including a marketmaker for price quotations to determine if the broker’s price really is the most favorable under the circumstances under no circumstances does the adviser “interposition” a broker in such trades for the purpose of generating a commission for such broker on occasion a mistake may occur in the execution of a trade as a fiduciary the adviser owes clients duties of loyalty and trust and as such must treat trade errors in a fair and equitable manner errors may occur for a number of reasons including human input error systems error communications error or incorrect application or understanding of a guideline or restriction examples of errors include but are not limited to the following buying securities not authorized for a client’s account buying or selling incorrect securities buying or selling incorrect amounts of securities and buying or selling in violation of one of our policies in correcting trade errors the adviser does not make the client account absorb any financial loss due to the trade error use soft dollars or directed trades to fix the error or attempt to fix the error using another client account to the extent correction of the error results in a loss to the client’s account the adviser reimburses the account to the extent correction of the error results in a gain to the client’s account the adviser allows the client to keep the benefit it is the adviser’s policy to seek the best execution of client security orders at the best security price available with respect to each transaction in light of the overall quality of brokerage and research services provided to it or its clients the best price means the best net price without regard to the mix between purchase or sales price and commissions  with respect to a specific order the adviser seeks to choose the broker most capable of providing the brokerage services necessary in seeking to obtain the best available price and most favorable execution the adviser notes the particular characteristics of a security to be traded including relevant market factors the adviser will also consider other factors such as ability to minimize trading costs level of trading expertise infrastructure ability to provide information or services financial condition confidentiality provided by brokerdealer competitiveness of commission rates evaluations of execution quality promptness of execution past history ability to prospect for and find liquidity difficulty of trade and security’s trading characteristics size of order liquidity of market block trading capabilities quality of settlements specialized expertise overall responsiveness and willingness to commit capital all of these considerations and others as relevant guide the adviser in selecting the appropriate venue eg an electronic communications network “ecn” or alternative trading system “ats” a traditional broker a crossing network etc in which to place an order and the proper tactics with which to trade in selecting a broker the adviser may also consider research or brokerage services provided by the brokerdealer consistent with the requirements of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “securities exchange act” and related interpretative guidance subject to the criteria of section e of the securities exchange act and regulatory guidance from the sec the adviser may pay a broker a brokerage commission in excess of that which another broker might have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the broker in other words the adviser may use client commissions or “soft dollars” to obtain research or brokerage services that benefit the adviser and its accounts because the use of client commissions to pay for research or brokerage services for which the adviser would otherwise have to pay presents a conflict of interest the adviser has adopted policies and procedures concerning soft dollars which addresses all aspects of its use of client commissions and requires that such use be consistent with section e provide lawful and appropriate assistance to us in the investment decisionmaking process and that the adviser determine that the value of the research or brokerage service obtained be reasonable in relation to the commissions paid the adviser may use client commissions to pay for research prepared by brokerdealers who execute client transactions “proprietary research” research prepared by third parties but for which executing brokerdealers are obligated to pay “thirdparty research” and certain other research or brokerage services the fund used no fund commissions for such purposes during the fiscal period ended december   research services provided by brokers may include information on the economy industries groups of securities individual companies technical market information risk measurement analyses performance analyses and analyses of corporate responsibility issues such research services may be received in the form of written reports telephone contacts and personal meetings with securities analysts in addition such research services may be provided in the form of access to various types of computergenerated data meetings arranged with corporate and industry spokespersons economists academicians and government representatives it is possible that research services received for a particular order will not inure to the direct benefit of the client eg the fund for which an order is placed the adviser has concluded however that the aggregate benefits received from all orders will benefit all of its clients also to facilitate best execution of trades the adviser may take advantage of order and report processing services offered by brokers who otherwise meet the adviser’s selection criteria the adviser reviews all such research and brokerage services annually to determine the reasonableness of the brokerage allocation andor price for such services receipt of products or services other   than brokerage or research is not a factor in allocating brokerage  where the adviser receives both administrative benefits and research and brokerage services from the services provided by brokers a good faith allocation between the administrative benefits and the research and brokerage services will be made and the adviser will pay for any administrative benefits with cash in making good faith allocations between administrative benefits and research and brokerage services a conflict of interest may exist by reason of the allocation by the adviser of the costs of such benefits and services between those that primarily benefit the adviser and those that primarily benefit clients the adviser may enter into informal arrangements with various brokers whereby in consideration for providing research services and subject to section e the adviser will allocate brokerage to those firms provided that the value of any research and brokerage services is reasonable in relation to the amount of commission paid and subject to best execution in no case will the adviser make binding commitments as to the level of the brokerage commissions it will allocate to a broker nor does the adviser “backstop” or otherwise guarantee any broker’s financial obligation to a third party for such research or services under no circumstances does the adviser consider the marketing efforts of brokerdealers on its or the fund’s behalf or investment opportunities offered by brokerdealers in selecting brokerdealers to execute client trades the adviser also has policies and procedures in place to limit and monitor gifts and entertainment received from third parties including brokerdealers that do business with the adviser or wish to do business with the adviser

shares placed through financial intermediaries the applicable public offering price will be the nav as so determined but only if the financial intermediary receives the order prior to the close of regular trading on the exchange the financial intermediary is responsible for transmitting such orders by a prescribed time to the fund if the financial intermediary fails to do so the investor will not receive that day’s nav if the financial intermediary receives the order after the close of regular trading on the exchange the price received by the investor will be based on the nav determined as

kind” ie in exchange for securities rather than cash the securities tendered as part of an inkind purchase must be included in the index tracked by the fund such securities must also be liquid securities that are not restricted as to transfer and have a value that is readily ascertainable as evidenced by a listing on the american stock exchange the exchange or nasdaq securities accepted by the fund will be valued as set forth in the fund’s prospectus as of the time of the next determination of nav after such acceptance shares of the fund are issued at the nav determined as of the same time all dividend subscription or other rights that are reflected in the market price of accepted securities at the time of valuation become the property of the fund and must be delivered to the fund

will not accept securities in exchange for its shares unless  such securities are at the time of the exchange eligible to be held by the fund  the transaction will not cause the fund’s weightings to become imbalanced with respect to the weightings of the securities included in the fund’s target index  the investor represents and agrees that all securities offered to the fund are not subject to any restrictions upon their sale by the fund under the securities act or otherwise restricted  such securities are traded in an unrelated transaction with a quoted sales price on the same day the exchange valuation is made and  the quoted sales price used as a basis of valuation is representative eg one that does not involve a trade of substantial size that artificially influences the price of the security investors interested in purchasing fund shares in kind should contact the fund at   tax matters the following is intended to be a general summary of certain us federal income tax consequences of investing in the fund it is not intended to be a complete discussion of all such federal income tax consequences nor does it purport to deal with all categories of investors this discussion reflects applicable tax laws of the united states as of the date of this sai which tax laws may change or be subject to new interpretation by the courts or the irs possibly with retroactive effect investors are therefore advised to consult with their own tax advisers before making an investment in the fund it is a policy of the fund to make distributions of substantially all of its net investment income and any net realized capital gains any capital gains realized during each fiscal year as defined by the code are normally declared and payable to shareholders in december but if necessary may be distributed at other times as well the fund declares and makes annual distributions of income if any if you buy shares when the fund has realized but not yet distributed income or capital gains you will be buying a dividend by paying the full price for the shares and then receiving a portion of the price back in the form of a taxable distribution to the extent the fund does not distribute or is not deemed to distribute all of its taxable income the fund will have to pay a corporate federal income tax on such income after deducting the amount of any deductible dividend distributions in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  federal excise tax at the fund level the fund has qualified and intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by satisfying certain requirements prescribed by subchapter m of the internal revenue code if the fund failed to qualify as a regulated investment company in any taxable year the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates in addition all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would generally be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income but may at least in part qualify for the dividends received deduction applicable to corporations or the reduced rate of taxation applicable to noncorporate holders for “qualified dividend income” in addition the fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains pay taxes and interest and make distributions before requalifying as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment  all income dividends and capital gains distributions if any on the fund’s shares are reinvested automatically in additional shares of the same class of shares of the fund at the nav determined on the first business day following the record date some foreign securities purchased by the fund may be subject to foreign taxes which could reduce the yield on such securities if the amount of foreign taxes is significant in a particular year and the fund qualifies under section  of the code it may elect to pass through such taxes to shareholders if such election is not made by the fund any foreign taxes paid or accrued will represent an expense to the fund which will reduce its investment company taxable income certain of the fund’s transactions involving derivatives and other similar transactions if any may be subject to special provisions of the code that among other things may affect the character amount and timing of distributions to shareholders in general you will recognize a gain or loss on the sale or redemption of

reflected in an upward adjustment to the basis of the shares acquired in general any gain or loss arising from the sale or redemption of shares of the fund will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the shares were held for longer than one year any capital loss arising from the sale or redemption of shares held for six months or less however is treated as a

security and the close of the normal trading session of the exchange a fund may value the security at its fair value valuing securities at fair value involves greater reliance on judgment than securities that have readily available market quotations there can be no assurance that a fund could obtain the fair value assigned to a security if it were to sell the security at approximately the time at which the fund determines its nav per share the fund prices foreign securities in terms of us dollars at the official exchange rate alternatively it may price these securities at the average of the current bid and asked price of such currencies against the dollar last quoted by a major bank that is a regular participant in the foreign exchange market or on the basis of a pricing service

of this code the covered officers are the funds principal executive officer principal financial officer principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the fund or by a third party at the date set forth in the caption of this code the covered officers of the fund are identified on exhibit a part two of this code also applies to members of each covered officers immediate family who live in the same household as the covered officer therefore for purposes of interpretation each obligation requirement or prohibition that applies to a covered officer also applies to such immediate family members for this purpose the term immediate family has the meaning set forth in section c of part one of this code b purpose the purpose of part two of this code is to deter wrongdoing and to promote  honest and ethical conduct including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships  full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that a registrant files with or submits to the sec and in other public communications made by the fund  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations  the prompt internal reporting of violations of part two of this code to the fund’s cco and  accountability for adherence to part two of this code c defined terms capitalized terms which are used in part two of this code and which are not otherwise defined in part two have the meanings assigned to them in part one of this code  covered officers should handle actual and apparent conflicts of interest ethically a general a conflict of interest occurs when a covered officers private interest interferes with the interests of or his or her service to the fund for example a conflict of interest would arise if a covered officer or a member of his or her immediate family living in the same household received improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the fund  certain conflicts of interest to which covered officers may be subject arise out of the relationships between covered officers and the fund and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the  act and the investment advisers act for example under the  act covered officers may not individually engage in certain transactions such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property with the fund because of their status as affiliated persons of the fund the funds and its advisers compliance policies and procedures are designed to prevent or identify and correct violations of these provisions part two of this code does not and is not intended to repeat or replace these policies and procedures and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of part two although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit conflicts also may arise from or as a result of the contractual relationships between the fund and other entities of which the covered officers are also officers or employees as a result the code recognizes that the covered officers may in the normal course of their duties for the fund and such other entities be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on the fund and such other entities the participation of the covered officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the fund and such other entities and is consistent with the performance by the covered officers of their duties as officers of the fund thus if performed in conformity with the provisions of the  act and to the extent applicable the investment advisers act such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically in addition it is recognized by the funds board that the covered officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other codes other conflicts of interest to which covered officers are subject are covered by part two of this code even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the  act and the investment advisers act the following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under part two of this code but covered officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive the overarching principle is that the personal interest of a covered officer should not be placed before the interest of the fund each covered officer must  not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the fund whereby the covered officer would benefit personally  not cause the fund to take action or fail to take action for the individual personal benefit of the covered officer rather than the benefit of the fund and  not intentionally or recklessly take or direct any action or failure to act that results in any sec filing or other public communication by the fund being materially misleading while personally benefiting such covered officer  b gifts and entertainment a covered officer must not solicit allow him or herself to be solicited or accept gifts entertainment or other gratuities intended to or appearing to influence decisions or favors toward the funds business to or from any client potential client fund vendor or potential vendor a covered officer may not give or accept gifts with a value exceeding  even if the gift does not oblige or influence the covered officer or is not intended to influence another notwithstanding this a covered officer may accept or provide reasonable business meals and entertainment if the client potential client fund vendor or potential vendor is physically present at the business meal or entertainment in the event that any such business meal or entertainment has a value exceeding  per person the covered officer must promptly report the meal or entertainment to fund compliance which shall maintain a record of such meals and entertainment and shall report such matter to the board of the fund at or before the next regular meeting of the board  disclosure and compliance a familiarity with disclosure requirements each covered officer shall familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the fund b avoiding misrepresentations each covered officer shall not knowingly misrepresent or knowingly cause others to misrepresent facts about the fund to others whether within or outside the fund including to the funds board auditors or counsel or to governmental regulators or selfregulatory organizations c promoting accurate disclosure each covered officer shall to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility consult with other officers and employees of the fund and their service providers with the goal of promoting full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the fund file with or submit to the sec and in other public communications made by the fund d promoting compliance each covered officer shall to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility promote compliance with the funds compliance policies and procedures adopted pursuant to rule a under the  act and with the laws rules and regulations applicable to the fund  reporting amendment and waivers a acknowledgement of part two upon first becoming subject to part two of this code and annually at the end of each calendar year each covered officer shall affirm in writing to the fund’s cco that he or she has received read and understands part two of this code b reporting of violations each covered officer shall report any violation of part two of this code of which he or she becomes aware whether committed by himself or herself or by another covered officer to the cco promptly after becoming aware of such violation the fund’s cco shall report any material violation of part two of this code of which it becomes aware whether though a report by a covered officer or otherwise to the board of the fund at or before the next regular meeting of the board together with fund compliances recommendation for the action if any to be taken with respect to such violation the board of the fund may
