pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th investment practices the prospectus contains information concerning each funds investment objective and principal investment strategies and risks this sai provides additional information concerning certain securities and strategies used by the funds and their associated risks in pursuing its investment objective each fund will invest as described below and in the prospectus convertible securities convertible securities include any corporate debt security or preferred stock that may be converted into underlying shares of common stock the common stock underlying convertible securities may be issued by a different entity than the issuer of the convertible securities convertible securities entitle the holder to receive interest payments paid on corporate debt securities or the dividend preference on a preferred stock until such time as the convertible security matures or is redeemed or until the holder elects to exercise the conversion privilege as a result of the conversion feature however the interest rate or dividend preference on a convertible security is generally less than would be the case if the securities were issued in nonconvertible form the value of convertible securities is influenced by both the yield of nonconvertible securities of comparable issuers and by the value of the underlying common stock the value of a convertible security viewed without regard to its conversion feature ie strictly on the basis of its yield is sometimes referred to as its investment value the investment value of the convertible security typically will fluctuate inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates however at the same time the convertible security will be influenced by its conversion value which is the market value of the underlying common stock that would be obtained if the convertible security were converted conversion value fluctuates directly with the price of the underlying common stock if because of a low price of the common stock the conversion value is substantially below the investment value of the convertible security the price of the convertible security is governed principally by its investment value if the conversion value of a convertible security increases to a point that approximates or exceeds its investment value the value of the security will be principally influenced by its conversion value a convertible security will sell at a premium over its conversion value to the extent investors place value on the right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed income security holders of convertible securities have a claim on the assets of the issuer prior to the common stockholders but may be subordinated to holders of similar nonconvertible securities of the same issuer synthetic convertible securities the funds may create a synthetic convertible security by combining fixed income securities with the right to acquire equity securities in creating a synthetic security the fund may pool a basket of fixedincome securities and a basket of warrants or options that produce the economic characteristics similar to a convertible security within each basket of fixedincome  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th securities and warrants or options different companies may issue the fixedincome and convertible components which may be purchased separately and at different times more flexibility is possible in the assembly of a synthetic convertible security than in the purchase of a convertible security although synthetic convertible securities may be selected where the two components are issued by a single issuer the character of a synthetic convertible security allows the combination of components representing distinct issuers when management believes that such a combination would better promote the funds investment objective a synthetic convertible security also is a more flexible investment in that its two components may be purchased separately for example the fund may purchase a warrant for inclusion in a synthetic convertible security but temporarily hold shortterm investments while postponing the purchase of a corresponding bond pending development of more favorable market conditions the convertible funds holdings of synthetic convertible securities are considered convertible securities for purposes of the funds policy to invest at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings in convertible securities a holder of a synthetic convertible security faces the risk of a decline in the price of the security or the level of the index involved in the convertible component causing a decline in the value of the call option or warrant purchased to create the synthetic convertible security should the price of the stock fall below the exercise price and remain there throughout the exercise period the entire amount paid for the call option or warrant would be lost because a synthetic convertible security includes the fixedincome component as well the holder of a synthetic convertible security also faces the risk that interest rates will rise causing a decline in the value of the fixedincome instrument the funds may also purchase synthetic convertible securities manufactured by other parties including convertible structured notes convertible structured notes are fixed income debentures linked to equity and are typically issued by investment banks convertible structured notes have the attributes of a convertible security however the investment bank that issued the convertible note assumes the credit risk associated with the investment rather than the issuer of the underlying common stock into which the note is convertible debt securities in pursuing its investment objective each fund may invest in convertible and nonconvertible debt securities including lowerrated securities ie securities rated bb or lower by standard  poors corporation a division of the mcgrawhill companies sp or ba or lower by moodys investor services inc moodys and securities that are not rated but are considered by the investment adviser to be of similar quality there are no restrictions as to the ratings of debt securities acquired by a fund or the portion of a funds assets that may be invested in debt securities in a particular ratings category except that no fund other than the high yield fund will acquire a security rated below c securities rated bbb or baa are considered to be medium grade and to have speculative characteristics lowerrated debt securities are predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal investment in medium or lowerquality debt securities involves greater investment risk including the possibility of issuer default or  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th bankruptcy an economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for such securities and adversely affect the value of such securities in addition lowerquality bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than higherquality instruments and generally are more sensitive to adverse economic changes or individual corporate developments during a period of adverse economic changes including a period of rising interest rates issuers of such bonds may experience difficulty in servicing their principal and interest payment obligations achievement by each fund of its investment objectives will be more dependent on the investment advisers credit analysis than would be the case if the fund were investing in higherquality debt securities because the ratings of rating services which evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments not market risks are used only as preliminary indicators of investment quality the investment adviser employs its own credit research and analysis these analyses may take into consideration such quantitative factors as an issuers present and potential liquidity profitability internal capability to generate funds debtequity ratio and debt servicing capabilities and such qualitative factors as an assessment of management industry characteristics accounting methodology and foreign business exposure medium and lowerquality debt securities may be less marketable than higherquality debt securities because the market for them is less broad the market for unrated debt securities is even narrower during periods of thin trading in these markets the spread between bid and asked prices is likely to increase significantly and the fund may have greater difficulty selling its portfolio securities the market value of these securities and their liquidity may be affected by adverse publicity and investor perceptions rule a securities each fund may purchase securities that have been privately placed but that are eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified institutional buyers such as the funds under rule a under the securities act of  the investment adviser under the supervision of the trusts board of trustees will consider whether securities purchased under rule a are illiquid and thus subject to the funds restriction of investing no more than a specified percentage of its net assets in illiquid securities a determination of whether a rule a security is liquid or not is a question of fact in making this determination the investment adviser will consider the trading markets for the specific security taking into account the unregistered nature of a rule a security in addition the investment adviser may consider the  frequency of trades and quotes  number of dealers and potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market and  nature of a security and of marketplace trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer the liquidity of rule a securities will be monitored and if as a result of changed conditions it is determined that a rule a security is no longer liquid the funds holdings of illiquid securities would be reviewed to determine what if any steps are required to assure that the fund does not invest more than  or  in the case of global growth and income fund of its assets in illiquid securities investing in rule a securities could have the effect of increasing the amount of the funds assets invested in illiquid securities if qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to purchase such securities  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th foreign securities global growth and income fund may invest all of its net

securities are denominated in foreign currencies a funds investment performance is affected by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar against those currencies for example if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall see discussion of transaction hedging and portfolio hedging below under currency exchange transactions investors should understand and consider carefully the risks involved in foreign investing investing in foreign securities which are generally denominated in foreign currencies and utilization of forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain considerations comprising both risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in us securities these considerations include fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies possible imposition of exchange control regulation or currency restrictions that would prevent cash from being brought back to the united states less public information with respect to issuers of securities less governmental supervision of stock exchanges securities brokers and issuers of securities lack of uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards lack of uniform settlement periods and trading practices less liquidity and frequently greater price volatility in foreign markets than in the united states possible imposition of foreign taxes and sometimes less advantageous legal operational and financial protections applicable to foreign subcustodial arrangements although the funds intend to invest in companies and government securities of countries having stable political environments there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation seizure or nationalization of foreign bank deposits or other assets establishment of exchange controls the adoption of foreign government restrictions or other adverse political social or diplomatic developments that could affect investment in these nations  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th each fund other than global growth and income fund expects that substantially all of its foreign investments will be in developed nations however each fund may invest in the securities of emerging countries the securities markets of emerging countries are substantially smaller less developed less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets of the us and other more developed countries disclosure and regulatory standards in many respects are less stringent than in the us and other major markets there also may be a lower level of monitoring and regulation of emerging markets and the activities of investors in such markets and enforcement of existing regulations has been extremely limited economies in individual emerging markets may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product rates of inflation currency depreciation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments positions many emerging market countries have experienced high rates of inflation for many years which has had and may continue to have very negative effects on the economies and securities markets of those countries currency exchange transactions currency exchange transactions may be conducted either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling currency prevailing in the foreign exchange market or through forward currency exchange contracts forward contracts forward contracts are contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specified currency at a specified future date or within a specified time period and price set at the time of the contract forward contracts are usually entered into with banks foreign exchange dealers and brokerdealers are not exchange traded and are usually for less than one year but may be renewed forward currency exchange transactions may involve currencies of the different countries in which the funds may invest and serve as hedges against possible variations in the exchange rate between these currencies currency exchange transactions are limited to transaction hedging and portfolio hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except to the extent described below under synthetic foreign money market positions transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward contracts with respect to specific receivables or payables of a fund accruing in connection with the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of dividends or interest thereon portfolio hedging is the use of forward contracts with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in a particular foreign currency portfolio hedging allows a fund to limit or reduce its exposure in a foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to sell such foreign currency or another foreign currency that acts as a proxy for that currency at a future date for a price payable in us dollars so that the value of the foreign denominated portfolio securities can be approximately matched by a foreign denominated liability a fund may not engage in portfolio hedging with respect to the currency of a particular country to an extent greater than the aggregate market value at the time of making such sale of the securities held in its portfolio denominated or quoted in that particular currency except that the fund may hedge all or part of its foreign currency exposure through the use of a basket of currencies or a proxy currency where such currencies or currency act as an effective proxy for other currencies in such a case the fund may enter into a forward contract where the amount of the foreign currency to be sold exceeds the value of the securities denominated in such currency the use of this basket hedging technique may be more efficient  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th and economical than entering into separate forward contracts for each currency held in the fund no fund may engage in speculative currency exchange transactions if a fund enters into a forward contract the funds custodian will segregate liquid assets of the fund having a value equal to the funds commitment under such forward contract at the maturity of the forward contract to deliver a particular currency the fund may either sell the portfolio security related to the contract and make delivery of the currency or it may retain the security and either acquire the currency on the spot market or terminate its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing an offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it to purchase on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency it is impossible to forecast with absolute precision the market value of portfolio securities at the expiration of a forward contract accordingly it may be necessary for a fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market and bear the expense of such purchase if the market value of the security is less than the amount of currency the fund is obligated to deliver and if a decision is made to sell the security and make delivery of the currency conversely it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the currency received upon the sale of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the amount of currency the fund is obligated to deliver if a fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting currency transaction the fund will incur a gain or a loss to the extent that there has been movement in forward contract prices if the fund engages in an offsetting currency transaction it may subsequently enter into a new forward contract to sell the currency should forward prices decline during the period between the funds entering into a forward contract for the sale of a currency and the date it enters into an offsetting contract for the purchase of the currency the fund will realize a gain to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to sell exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase should forward prices increase the fund will suffer a loss to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to sell a default on the contract would deprive the fund of unrealized profits or force the fund to cover its commitments for purchase or sale of currency if any at the current market price hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines hedging transactions also preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency should rise moreover it may not be possible for a fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates the cost to a fund of engaging in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as the currency involved the length of the contract period and prevailing market conditions because currency exchange transactions are usually conducted on a principal basis no fees or commissions are involved synthetic foreign money market positions each fund may invest in money market instruments denominated in foreign currencies in addition to or in lieu of such direct investment a fund may construct a synthetic foreign money market position by a purchasing a money market instrument denominated in one currency generally us dollars and b concurrently entering into a forward contract to deliver  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a corresponding amount of that currency in exchange for a different currency on a future date and at a specified rate of exchange for example a synthetic money market position in japanese yen could be constructed by purchasing a us dollar money market instrument and entering concurrently into a forward contract to deliver a corresponding amount of us dollars in exchange for japanese yen on a specified date and at a specified rate of exchange because of the availability of a variety of highly liquid shortterm us dollar money market instruments a synthetic money market position utilizing such us dollar instruments may offer greater liquidity than direct investment in foreign currency and a concurrent construction of a synthetic position in such foreign currency in terms of both income yield and gain or loss from changes

may enter into interest rate currency index credit default and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars each fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the

the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices a credit default swap is an agreement to transfer the credit exposure of fixed income products between parties the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values a fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with the fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments inasmuch as a fund will segregate assets or enter into offsetting positions to cover its obligations under swaps calamos advisors llc calamos advisors and the trust believe such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the investment company act of  and

certain other investments this type of restructuring involves the deposit with or purchase by an entity such as a corporation or trust of specified instruments and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities structured products backed by or representing interests in the underlying instruments the term structured products as used herein excludes synthetic convertibles see investment practices  synthetic convertible securities the cash flow on the underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured products to create securities with different investment characteristics such as varying maturities payment priorities and interest rate provisions and the extent of the payments made with respect to structured products is dependent on the extent

each fund may also invest in other types of structured products including among others baskets of credit default swaps referencing a portfolio of highyield securities a structured product may be considered to be leveraged to the extent its interest rate varies by a magnitude that exceeds the magnitude of the change in the index rate because they are linked to their underlying markets or securities investments in structured products generally are subject to greater volatility than an investment directly in the underlying market or security total return on the structured product is derived by linking return to one or more characteristics of the underlying instrument because certain structured products of the type in which a fund may invest may involve no credit enhancement the credit risk of those structured products generally would be equivalent to that of the underlying instruments a fund may invest in a class of structured products that is either subordinated or unsubordinated to the right of payment of another class subordinated structured products typically have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated structured products although a funds purchase of subordinated structured products would have similar economic effect to that of borrowing against the underlying securities the purchase will not be deemed to be leverage for purposes of

is authorized to purchase and sell write exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option otc options are purchased from or sold to counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparties in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties a fund will only sell write otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to the fund at a formula price within seven days the funds expect generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although they are not required to do so the staff of the securities and exchange commission the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by a fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it or the amount of assets equal to the formula price for the repurchase of the option if any less the amount by which the option is in the money are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets or  in the case of global growth and income fund in illiquid securities each fund may also purchase and sell write options on securities indices and other financial indices options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option or an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making upon the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a fund will sell write call options and put options only if they are covered for example a call option written by a fund will require such fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by a fund on an index will require such fund to own portfolio securities that correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by a fund requires such fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price otc options entered into by a fund and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when a fund sells writes these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by a fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when a fund sells writes a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price such fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by a fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and such fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery if an option written by a fund expires such fund realizes a capital gain equal to the premium received at the time the option was written if an option purchased by a fund expires such fund realizes a capital loss equal to the premium paid a fund will realize a capital gain from a closing purchase transaction if the cost of the closing option is less than the premium received from writing the option or if it is more such fund will realize a capital loss if the premium received from a closing sale transaction is more than the premium paid to purchase the option a fund will realize a capital gain or if it is less such fund will realize a capital loss the principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand interest rates the current market price of the underlying security or index in relation to the exercise price of the option the volatility of the underlying security or index and the time remaining until the expiration date a put or call option purchased by a fund is an asset of such fund valued initially at the premium paid for the option the premium

depend on the investment advisers ability to predict pertinent market investments which cannot be assured a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller writer of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms if a fund were unable to close out an option that it has purchased on a security it would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option would expire and become worthless if a fund were unable to close out a covered call option that it had written on a security it would not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expired as the writer of a covered call option on a security a fund foregoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price of the call as the writer of a covered call option on a foreign currency a fund foregoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from currency appreciation the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty as described above under options on securities indexes and currencies fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly calamos advisors must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied each fund may purchase and sell write call options on securities indices and currencies all calls sold by a fund must be covered even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes such fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to

including but not limited to us treasury bonds us treasury notes eurodollar certificates of deposit and foreign currencies other index and financial instrument futures contracts are available and it is expected that additional futures contracts will be developed and traded each fund may enter into such contract if in the investment advisers opinion such contract meets the investment parameters of the fund each fund may purchase and write call and put futures options futures options possess many of the same characteristics as options on securities indexes and foreign currencies discussed above a futures option gives the holder the right in return for the premium paid to assume a long position call or short position put in a futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option upon exercise of a call option the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite short position in the case of a put option the opposite is true the fund might for example use futures contracts to hedge against or gain exposure to fluctuations in the general level of stock prices anticipated changes in interest rates or currency fluctuations that might adversely affect either the value of the funds securities or the price of the securities that the fund intends to purchase although other techniques could be used to reduce or increase the funds exposure to stock price interest rate and currency fluctuations the fund may be able to achieve its desired exposure more effectively and perhaps at a lower cost by using futures contracts and futures options a fund will only enter into futures contracts and futures options that are standardized and traded on an exchange board of trade or similar entity or quoted on an automated quotation system the success of any futures transaction depends on the investment adviser correctly predicting changes in the level and direction of stock prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other factors should those predictions be incorrect the funds return might have been better had the transaction not been attempted however in the absence of the ability to use   a futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was originally written although the value of a securities index is a function of the value of certain specified securities no physical delivery of those securities is made  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th futures contracts the investment adviser might have taken portfolio actions in anticipation of the same market movements with similar investment results but presumably at greater transaction costs when a purchase or sale of a futures contract is made by a fund the fund is required to deposit with its custodian or broker if legally permitted a specified amount of cash or us government securities or other securities acceptable to the broker initial margin the margin required for a futures contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified during the term of the contract although a funds broker may require margin deposits in excess of the minimum required by the exchange the initial margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the futures contract which is returned to the fund upon termination of the contract assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied the fund expects to earn interest income on its initial margin deposits a futures contract held by the fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of the exchange on which it is traded each day the fund pays or receives cash called variation margin equal to the daily change in value of the futures contract this process is known as markingtomarket variation margin paid or received by the fund does not represent a borrowing or loan by the fund but is instead settlement between the fund and the broker of the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract had expired at the close of the previous day in computing daily net asset value the fund will marktomarket its open futures positions the fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin with respect to put and call options on futures contracts written by it such margin deposits will vary depending on the nature of the underlying futures contract and the related initial margin requirements the current market value of the option and other futures positions held by the fund although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities usually these obligations are closed out prior to delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts same exchange underlying security or index and delivery

an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price the fund engaging in the transaction realizes a capital gain or if it is less the fund realizes a capital loss the transaction costs must also be included in these calculations risks associated with futures there are several risks associated with the use of futures contracts and futures options a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract in trying to increase or reduce market exposure there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures contract and in the portfolio exposure sought in addition there are significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between the markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives the degree of imperfection of correlation depends on circumstances such as variations in speculative market demand for futures futures options and the related securities including technical influences in futures and futures options trading and differences between the securities markets and the securities underlying the standard contracts available for trading for example in the case of index futures contracts the composition of the index including the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th issuers and the weighing of each issue may differ from the composition of the funds portfolio and in the case of interest rate futures contracts the interest rate levels maturities and creditworthiness of the issues underlying the futures contract may differ from the financial instruments held in the funds portfolio a decision as to whether when and how to use futures contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected stock price or interest rate trends futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day the daily limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous days settlement price at the end of the current trading session once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit the daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions for example futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses stock index futures contracts are not normally subject to such daily price change limitations there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a fund seeks to close out a futures or futures option position the fund would be exposed to possible loss on the position during the interval of inability to close and would continue to be required to meet margin requirements until the position is closed in addition many of the contracts discussed above are relatively new instruments without a significant trading history as a result there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or continue to exist limitations on options and futures if other options futures contracts or futures options of types other than those described herein are traded in the future a fund may also use those investment vehicles provided the board of trustees determines that their use is consistent with the funds investment objective a fund will not enter into a futures contract or purchase

options on specific securities in its portfolio the value of those securities will be deducted from the current market value of the securities portfolio in order to comply with commodity futures trading commission cftc regulation  and thereby avoid being deemed a commodity pool operator a fund may use commodity futures or commodity options contracts for either risk management or speculative purposes without any limitation on the notional value of such positions the funds have qualified for an exemption from registration as commodity pool operators pursuant to cftc regulation  and therefore are not subject to registration or regulation under the commodity exchange act as amended taxation of options and futures if a fund exercises a call or put option that it holds the premium paid for the option is added to the cost basis of the security purchased call or deducted from the proceeds of the security sold put for cash settlement options and futures options exercised by the

the unrealized gains on the securities covering the option may be subject to deferral until the securities covering the option have been sold a futures contract held until delivery results in capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the price at which the futures contract was entered into and the settlement price on the earlier of delivery notice date or expiration date if the fund delivers securities under a futures contract the fund also realizes a capital gain or loss on those securities for federal income tax purposes a fund generally is required to recognize as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses as of the end of the year on futures futures options and nonequity options positions yearend marktomarket generally any gain or loss recognized with respect to such positions either by yearend marktomarket or by actual closing of the positions is considered to be  longterm and  shortterm without regard to the holding periods of the contracts however in the case of positions classified as part of a mixed straddle the recognition of losses on certain positions including options futures and futures options positions the related securities and certain successor positions thereto may be deferred to a later taxable year sale of futures contracts or writing of call options or futures call options or buying put options or futures put options that are intended to hedge against a change in the value of securities held by the fund  will affect the holding period of the hedged securities and  may cause unrealized gain or loss on such securities to be recognized upon entry into the hedge if a fund were to enter into a short index future short index futures option or short index option position and the funds portfolio were deemed to mimic the performance of the index underlying such contract the option or futures contract position and the funds stock positions would be deemed to be positions in a mixed straddle subject to the abovementioned loss deferral rules in order for a fund to continue to qualify for federal income tax treatment as a regulated investment company at least  of its gross income for a taxable year must be derived from qualifying income ie dividends interest income derived from loans of securities and gains from the sale of securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures or forward contracts any net gain realized from futures or futures options contracts will be considered gain from the sale of securities and therefore be qualifying income for purposes of the  requirement each fund distributes to shareholders annually any net capital gains that have been recognized for federal income tax purposes including yearend marktomarket gains on options and futures transactions such distributions are combined with distributions of capital gains realized on the funds other investments and shareholders are advised of the nature of the payments warrants each fund may invest in warrants a warrant is a right to purchase common stock at a specific price usually at a premium above the market value of the underlying common stock at time of issuance during a specified period of time a warrant may have a life ranging from less  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd than a year to twenty years or longer but a warrant becomes worthless unless it is exercised or sold before expiration in addition if the market price of the common stock does not exceed the warrants exercise price during the life of the warrant the warrant will expire worthless warrants have no voting rights pay no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation issuing them the percentage increase or decrease in the value of a warrant may be greater than the percentage increase or decrease in the value of the underlying common stock portfolio turnover although the funds do not purchase securities with a view to rapid turnover there are no limitations on the length of time that portfolio securities must be held portfolio turnover can occur for a number of reasons including calls for redemption general conditions in the securities markets more favorable investment opportunities in other securities or other factors relating to the desirability of holding or changing a portfolio investment the portfolio turnover rates may vary greatly from year to year a high rate of portfolio turnover in a fund would result in increased transaction expense which must be borne by that fund high portfolio turnover may also result in the realization of capital gains or losses and to the extent net shortterm capital gains are realized any distributions resulting from such gains will be considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes portfolio turnover for each fund is shown under financial highlights in the prospectus short sales each fund may attempt to hedge against market risk and to enhance income by selling short against the box that is  entering into short sales of securities that it currently has the right to acquire through the conversion or exchange of other securities that it owns or to a lesser extent entering into short sales of securities that it currently owns and  entering into arrangements with the brokerdealers through which such securities are sold short to receive income with respect to the proceeds of short sales during the period the funds short positions remain open each fund other than market neutral fund may make short sales of securities only if at all times when a short position is open the fund owns an equal amount of such securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for without payment of any further consideration securities of the same issue as and equal in amount to the securities sold short in addition to selling short against the box market neutral fund may sell short securities that it currently has the right to acquire upon payment of additional consideration for instance upon exercise of a warrant or option market neutral fund would use this technique to hedge against market risk in connection with a synthetic convertible security in the same way selling short against the box hedges against market risk in connection with a true convertible security in a short sale against the box a fund does not deliver from its portfolio the securities sold and does not receive immediately the proceeds from the short sale instead the fund borrows the securities sold short from a brokerdealer through which the short sale is executed and the brokerdealer delivers such securities on behalf of the fund to the purchaser of such securities such brokerdealer is entitled to retain the proceeds from the short sale until the fund delivers to such brokerdealer the securities sold short in addition the fund is required to pay to the brokerdealer the amount of any dividends paid on shares sold short finally to secure its  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd obligation to deliver to such brokerdealer the securities sold short the fund must deposit and continuously maintain in a separate account with the funds custodian an equivalent amount of the securities sold short or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities without the payment of additional consideration the fund is said to have a short position in the securities sold until it delivers to the brokerdealer the securities sold at which time the fund receives the proceeds of the sale because the fund ordinarily will want to continue to hold securities in its portfolio that are sold short the fund will normally close out a short position by purchasing on the open market and delivering to the brokerdealer an equal amount of the securities sold short rather than by delivering portfolio securities a short sale works the same way except that the fund places in the segregated account cash or us government securities equal in value to the difference between i the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were sold short and ii any cash or us government securities required to be deposited with the broker as collateral in addition so long as the short position is open the fund must adjust daily the value of the segregated account so that the amount deposited in it plus any amount deposited with the broker as collateral will equal the current market value of the security sold short however the value of the segregated account may not be reduced below the point at which the segregated account plus any amount deposited with the broker is equal to the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were sold short market neutral fund will conduct its short sales so that no more than  of the net assets of the fund when added together will be i deposited with brokers as collateral and ii allocated to segregated accounts in connection with short sales at any time short sales may protect a fund against the risk of losses in the value of its portfolio securities because any unrealized losses with respect to such portfolio securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position however any potential gains in such portfolio securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position the extent to which such gains or losses are offset will depend upon the amount of securities sold short relative to the amount the fund owns either directly or indirectly and in the case where the fund owns convertible securities changes in the conversion premium short sale transactions of a fund involve certain risks in particular the imperfect correlation between the price movements of the convertible securities and the price movements of the underlying common stock being sold short creates the possibility that losses on the short sale hedge position may be greater than gains in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged in addition to the extent that a fund pays a conversion premium for a convertible security the fund is generally unable to protect against a loss of such premium pursuant to a short sale hedge in determining the number of shares to be sold short against a funds position in the convertible securities the anticipated fluctuation in the conversion premiums is considered a fund will also incur transaction costs in connection with short sales certain provisions of the code may limit the degree to which the fund is able to enter into short sales which limitations might impair the funds ability to achieve its investment objective see taxation  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in addition to enabling a fund to hedge against market risk short sales may afford a fund an opportunity to earn additional current income to the extent the fund is able to enter into arrangements with brokerdealers through which the short sales are executed to receive income with respect to the proceeds of the short sales during the period the funds short positions remain open the code imposes constructive sale treatment for federal income tax purposes on certain hedging strategies with respect to appreciated securities under these rules taxpayers will recognize gain but not loss with respect to securities if they enter into short sales or offsetting notional principal contracts as defined by the act or futures or forward contracts as defined by the act with respect to the same or substantially identical property or if they enter into such transactions and then acquire the same or substantially identical property the secretary of the treasury is authorized to promulgate regulations that will treat as constructive sales certain transactions that have substantially the same effect as short sales whenissued and delayed delivery securities and reverse repurchase agreements each fund may purchase securities on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis although the payment and interest terms of these securities are established at the time the fund enters into the commitment the securities may be delivered and paid for a month or more after the date of purchase when their value may have changed the fund makes such commitments only with the intention of actually acquiring the securities but may sell the securities before settlement date if calamos advisors deems it advisable for investment reasons the fund may utilize spot and forward foreign currency exchange transactions to reduce the risk inherent in fluctuations in the exchange rate between one currency and another when securities are purchased or sold on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis each fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and securities dealers a reverse repurchase agreement is a repurchase agreement in which the fund is the seller of rather than the investor in securities and agrees to repurchase them at an agreedupon time and price use of a reverse repurchase agreement may be preferable to a regular sale and later repurchase of securities because it avoids certain market risks and transaction costs at the time when a fund enters into a binding obligation to purchase securities on a whenissued basis or enters into a reverse repurchase agreement liquid assets cash us government securities or other highgrade debt obligations of the fund having a value at least as great as the purchase price of the securities to be purchased will be segregated on the books of the fund and held by the custodian throughout the period of the obligation the use of these investment strategies as well as borrowing under a line of credit as described below may increase net asset value fluctuation illiquid securities global growth and income

marketable either because they are restricted securities or for other reasons restricted securities are securities that are subject to restrictions  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th on resale because they have not been registered for sale under the securities act of  a position in restricted securities might adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of a portion of the funds portfolio and the fund might not be able to dispose of its holdings in such securities promptly or at reasonable prices in those instances where a fund is required to have restricted securities held by it registered prior to sale by the fund and the fund does not have a contractual commitment from the issuer or seller to pay the costs of such registration the gross proceeds from the sale of securities would be reduced by the registration costs and underwriting discounts any such registration costs are not included in the percentage limitation on a funds investment in restricted

category by a recognized rating agency and repurchase agreements repurchase agreements as part of its strategy for the temporary investment of cash each fund may enter into repurchase agreements pertaining to us government securities with member banks of the federal reserve system or primary dealers as designated by the federal reserve bank of new york in such securities a repurchase agreement arises when a fund purchases a security and simultaneously agrees to resell it to the vendor at an agreed upon future date the resale price is greater than the purchase price reflecting an agreed upon market rate of return that is effective for the period of time the fund holds the security and that is not related to the coupon rate on the purchased security such agreements generally

may defer receipt of all or a portion of his compensation from the trust to defer payment of income taxes or for other reasons the deferred compensation payable to the participating trustee is credited to the trustees deferral account as of the business day such compensation would have been paid to the trustee the value of a trustees deferred compensation account at any time is equal to what would be the value if the amounts credited to the account had instead been invested in shares of one or more of the funds of the trust as designated by the trustee thus the value of the account increases with contributions to the account or with increases in the value of the measuring shares and the value of the account decreases with withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the measuring shares if a participating trustee retires the trustee may elect to receive payments under the plan in a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a period of five years if a participating trustee dies any amount payable under the plan will be paid to the trustees beneficiaries each funds obligation to make payments under the plan is a general obligation of that fund no fund is liable for any other funds obligations to make payments under the plan code of ethics employees of calamos advisors and cfs are permitted to make personal securities transactions including transactions in securities that the trust may purchase sell or hold subject to requirements and restrictions set forth in the code of ethics of the trust calamos advisors and cfs the code of ethics contains provisions and requirements designed to identify and address certain conflicts of interest between personal investment activities of calamos advisors and cfs employees and the interests of investment advisory clients such as the trust among other things the code of ethics prohibits certain types of transactions absent prior approval imposes time periods during which personal transactions may not be made in certain securities and requires the submission of duplicate broker confirmations and statements and quarterly reporting of securities transactions additional restrictions apply to portfolio managers traders research analysts and others involved in the investment advisory process exceptions to these and other provisions of the code of ethics may be granted

general oversight each fund expects calamos advisors to vote proxies related to that funds portfolio securities for which the fund has voting authority consistent with the funds best economic interests calamos advisors has adopted its own proxy voting policies and procedures policies the policies address among other things conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the funds and the interests of the adviser and its affiliates the following is a summary of the policies used by calamos advisors in voting proxies to assist it in voting proxies calamos advisors has established a committee comprised of members of its portfolio management and research departments the committee andor its members will vote proxies using the following guidelines in general if calamos advisors believes that a companys management and board have interests sufficiently aligned with the funds interest calamos advisors will vote in favor of  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd proposals recommended by a companys board more specifically calamos advisors seeks to ensure that the board of directors of a company is sufficiently aligned with security holders interests and provides proper oversight of the companys management in many cases this may be best accomplished by having a majority of independent board members although calamos advisors will examine board member elections on a casebycase basis it will generally vote for the election of directors that would result in a board comprised of a majority of independent directors because of the enormous variety and complexity of transactions that are presented to shareholders such as mergers acquisitions reincorporations adoptions of antitakeover measures including adoption of a shareholder rights plan requiring supermajority voting on particular issues adoption of fair price provisions issuance of blank check preferred stocks and the creation of a separate class of stock with unequal voting rights changes to capital structures including authorizing additional shares repurchasing stock or approving a stock split executive compensation and option plans that occur in a variety of industries companies and market cycles it is extremely difficult to foresee exactly what would be in the best interests of the fund in all circumstances moreover voting on such proposals involves considerations unique to each transaction accordingly calamos advisors will vote on a casebycase basis on proposals presenting these transactions finally calamos advisors has established procedures to help resolve conflicts of interests that might arise when voting proxies for the funds these procedures provide that the committee along with calamos advisors legal and compliance departments will examine conflicts of interests with the fund of which calamos advisors is aware and seek to resolve such conflicts in the best interests of the fund irrespective of any such conflict if a member of the committee has a personal conflict of interest that member will refrain from voting and the remainder of the committee will determine how to vote the proxy solely on the investment merits of any proposal the committee will then memorialize the conflict and the procedures used to address the conflict you may obtain a copy of calamos advisors policies by calling   by visiting the funds website at wwwcalamoscom by

growth in the size of the funds would be in the best interests of shareholders because increased size would allow the funds to realize certain economies of scale in their operations and would likely reduce the proportionate share of expenses borne by each shareholder the board of trustees therefore determined that it would benefit each of the funds to have monies available for the direct distribution and service activities of cfs as the funds distributor in promoting the continuous sale of the funds shares the board of trustees including the noninterested trustees concluded in the exercise of their reasonable business judgment and in light of their fiduciary duties that there is a reasonable likelihood that the plans will benefit the funds and their shareholders the plan has

limited andor iv cause a fund to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the  distribution requirement and the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes the funds will monitor their transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent

all shares of each fund then outstanding were redesignated as class a shares of that fund under the terms of the agreement and declaration of trust the trustees may issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest without par value for each series of shares authorized by the trustees and the trustees may divide the shares of any series into two or more classes of shares of that series as of the date of this statement of additional  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd information the trust has eight series in operation all shares issued will be fully paid and nonassessable and will have no preemptive or conversion rights in the future the board of trustees may authorize the issuance of shares of additional series and additional classes of shares of any series each funds shares of a given class are entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends and other distributions declared by the funds board of trustees with respect to shares of the fund all shares of the fund of a given class have equal rights in the event of liquidation of that class under massachusetts law the shareholders of the trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the trusts obligations however the trusts declaration of trust disclaims liability of the shareholders trustees and officers of the trust for acts or obligations of the funds that are binding only on the assets and property of the fund the declaration of trust requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement obligation or contract entered into or executed by the trust or the board of trustees the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of a funds assets of all losses and expenses of any fund shareholder held personally liable for the funds obligations thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is remote because it is limited to circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the fund itself is unable to meet its obligations voting rights each share has one vote and fractional shares have fractional votes as a business trust the trust is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings however special meetings may be called for purposes such as electing or removing trustees changing fundamental policies or approving an investment advisory agreement financial statements audited financial statements

bond ratings a rating of a rating service represents the services opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer consequently calamos advisors believes that the quality of debt securities in which a fund invests should be continuously reviewed a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating should be evaluated independently ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources that they consider reliable ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons the following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by moodys investors service inc moodys and standard  poors corporation a division of the mcgrawhill companies sp moodys ratings aaabonds rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as giltedged interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure although the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such bonds aabonds rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the long term risk appear somewhat larger than in aaa bonds abonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper mediumgrade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds rated baa are considered as mediumgrade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well babonds rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class a plast�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th bbonds rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small caabonds rated caa are of poor standing such bonds may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest cabonds rated ca represent obligations that are speculative in a high degree such bonds are often in default or have other marked shortcomings sp ratings aaabonds rated aaa have the highest rating the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is extremely strong aabonds rated aa differ from aaa bonds only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is very strong abonds rated a are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is still strong bbbbonds rated bbb exhibit adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the bond bbbccccc and cbonds rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the lowest degree of speculation among such bonds and c the highest degree of speculation while such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions a rdates referenced herein � and � documents

this summary of the code of ethics and insider trading policy the code is provided for your convenience it is not a substitute for reading and understanding the code and all personnel are responsible for complying with the code as a condition of continuing employment with calamos asset management inc cam its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively calamos one of the most important assets that calamos has is its reputation clients would not retain calamos or invest in its products if they did not trust us and the code is designed to establish certain standards and procedures that will ensure that their trust is wellplaced most of the provisions of the code mirror requirements of federal securities laws or those of agencies that regulate our businesses such as the securities and exchange commission and the nasd these provisions require calamos to place the interests of its clients first at all times and not to take inappropriate advantage of the trust which our clients and others place in us the code also is designed to assure that calamos investment decisions remain independent and are not influenced by personal considerations the code addresses five main areas  restrictions on the use of material nonpublic information  confidentiality of information obtained in the course of employment  public disclosure of information about cam  the buying and selling of securities by calamos personnel including the buying and selling of securities of cam itself and  specific limitations on activity of calamos personnel imposed by various regulations the first four of these areas focus on the legal and regulatory obligations of calamos and its personnel with respect to inside information and trading on or disclosing that information the final area deals with regulatory limitations on conduct by calamos personnel that could potentially harm calamos or its customers in other ways frequently asked questions about the code  provisions of the code apply to all

pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  the de minimis exception does not exist for purchases and sales of cam securities all transactions in cam securities must be precleared  any investment in an openend mutual fund advised or subadvised by calamos must be held for at least  days exceptions must receive prior approval and will be limited to hardship or other unusual circumstances  you must preclear the purchase or sale of exchange traded funds as these securities are deemed to be covered securities under the provisions of the code  you may not purchase or sell exchange traded or

information from government agencies ask first if you have questions regarding the code or any particular securities transaction call a member of the legal and compliance department before acting  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th understanding and applying the code purpose the investment management mutual funds and financial services industries are highly regulated all are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations designed to protect investors similarly publiclytraded companies are required to meet strict standards to protect the integrity of the markets in which their securities trade calamos asset management inc cam is a publiclytraded company its subsidiaries and affiliated companies are primarily involved in the investment management mutual funds and financial services industries predictably cam is subject to a wide variety of regulations these regulations also apply to the directors officers and employees of calamos and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated in this code of ethics and insider trading policy the code the term calamos will mean cam and its subsidiaries the purpose of the code is to explain certain of the responsibilities of calamos and its personnel and to establish standards to which all calamos personnel are held the code supplements the cam code of business conduct and ethics and the calamos employee handbook scope the code applies to all directors officers and employees of calamos and other businesses effectively controlled by calamos as well as to any outsiders including agents and consultants that have access through calamos to material nonpublic information the code applies to all transactions in securities including but not limited to common stock options and other derivative instruments eg futures contracts for common stock debt securities and any other securities that cam or any other company may issue questions regarding the code or its application to specific transactions should be directed to the chief compliance officer or general counsel of calamos understanding the terms various securities laws make it illegal to buy or sell a companys securities when in possession of material nonpublic information as defined below about the issuer or its securities this conduct is known as insider trading passing on material nonpublic information to someone else who may buy or sell securities to which the information relates is also illegal this conduct is known as tipping material information information should be regarded as material if it could be important to decisions to buy sell or hold a companys securities any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of company securities should be considered material material information can be positive or negative and can relate to historical facts projections or future events material information can pertain to a company as a whole or to divisions or subsidiaries of a company during the course of their employment calamos personnel can learn material information about many companies including cam information dealing with the following subjects is likely to be found material in particular situations  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th financial related subjects  financial results  changes in earnings forecasts  unusual significant gains losses or charges  significant writedowns in assets  significant changes in revenues  significant liquidity issues  changes in dividends  stock splits  stock repurchases  changes in debt ratings  significant new equity or debt offerings corporate developments  proposals plans or agreements even if preliminary in nature involving significant mergers acquisitions divestitures recapitalizations or strategic alliances  major

to a companys distribution relationships  significant developments related to intellectual property other subjects  developments regarding significant litigation  developments regarding government agency actions  execution or termination of significant contracts this list is only illustrative and certainly is not allencompassing many other types of information may be considered material when in doubt about whether particular information about cam or another company is material exercise caution and consult with the chief compliance officer or the general counsel nonpublic information information about a company is considered nonpublic if it is not available to the general public in order for information to be considered available to the general public it must have been widely disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors this is generally done by the company issuing a national press release or making a publiclyavailable filing with the securities and exchange commission sec the circulation of rumors even if accurate and reported in the media does not constitute effective public dissemination  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th even after public disclosure of material information regarding a company an insider with knowledge of the information must wait a period of two full trading days after the publication for the information to be absorbed before that person can treat the information as public for purposes of the code a full trading day means from the opening of trading on nasdaq to the closing of trading on nasdaq on that day accordingly if an announcement is made before the commencement of trading on a tuesday an employee in possession of such information may trade in company securities starting on thursday of that week subject to any applicable blackout period and assuming the employee is not aware of other material nonpublic information at that time because two full trading days would have elapsed by then all of tuesday and wednesday if the announcement is made on tuesday after trading has begun on nasdaq an employee in possession of the information may not trade in company securities until friday if the announcement is made on friday after trading begins an employee may not trade in company securities until wednesday of the following week nasdaq holidays do not count as trading days and will impact this schedule material nonpublic information material nonpublic information is information that is not known to the general public that if known could reasonably be expected to affect the price of a companys securities or be considered important in deciding whether to buy sell or hold a security it is often referred to as inside information tipping tipping is the disclosure of material nonpublic information to another person for the purpose of trading or other unauthorized purpose tipping can result in liability for both the tipper and tippee covered security covered security means any stock bond future investment contract shares of closedend mutual funds shares of openend mutual funds for which calamos is the advisor or subadvisor exchange traded funds or any other instrument that is considered a security of the investment company act of  the term covered security is very broad and includes items you might not ordinarily think of as securities such as options on securities on indexes and on currencies limited partnerships foreign unit trusts foreign mutual funds municipal securities private investment funds hedge funds investment clubs or any right to acquire any security such as a warrant or convertible in addition purchases and sale transactions in covered securities in any k plan excluding percentage allocation changes or payroll deduction percentages are considered transactions in covered securities the term covered security does not include direct obligations of the u s government us treasury bills notes and bonds and money market instruments including bank certificates of deposit bankers acceptances commercial paper and repurchase agreements shares of openend mutual funds not advised or subadvised by calamos and units in  college savings plans beneficial interest beneficial interest shall be interpreted in the same manner as it would be under rule a of the securities exchange act of  as amended in determining whether a person is a beneficial owner of a security for the purposes of section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended and rules and regulations thereunder as a general matter beneficial interest will be attributed to a covered person where the covered person i possesses the ability to purchase or sell covered securities or ability to  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th direct the disposition of the covered securities ii possesses voting power including the power to vote or to direct the voting over such covered securities or iii receives any benefits substantially equivalent to those of ownership consequences of failure to comply with code external penalties legal penalties for trading on or tipping material nonpublic information are severe they include criminal fines civil fines of several times the profits gained or losses avoided imprisonment and private party damages the penalties also may apply to anyone who directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed the violation including the employer and its management and supervisory personnel significant penalties have been imposed even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading action by calamos in addition to these possible outside sanctions calamos personnel who violate prohibitions on insider trading or tipping will face additional action from calamos itself up to and including termination of employment compliance with the provisions of the code is a condition of employment of calamos taking into consideration all relevant circumstances management of calamos will

the code or to comply with request for information from government agencies additional information may be required to clarify the nature of particular transactions  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th restrictions on the use of confidential information by calamos personnel general prohibitions material nonpublic information is a legally very important type of confidential information but it is only one type of confidential information our customers and suppliers entrust calamos with important information relating to their personal and business matters the nature of this relationship requires strict confidentiality and trust in safeguarding the information received calamos earns the respect and further trust of our customers and suppliers all employees will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time they are hired and this agreement carries an obligation to maintain strict confidentiality even after an employees employment is terminated any violation of confidentiality seriously injures calamos reputation and effectiveness therefore personnel are not to discuss confidential calamos business with anyone who does not work for calamos and should never discuss business transactions with anyone who does not have a direct association with the transaction even casual remarks can be misinterpreted and repeated therefore employees should develop the personal discipline necessary to maintain confidentiality if an employee becomes aware of anyone breaking this trust they should report the incident to a member of management immediately if someone outside calamos or the employees department asks questions regarding confidential matters you are not required to answer instead you should refer the request to the department supervisor or a member of senior management no one is permitted to remove or make copies of any calamos records reports or documents without prior approval from management material nonpublic information about other companies calamos personnel may become aware of confidential information concerning another company this information may be material nonpublic information and as noted above trading of securities including futures or options of the company based on this information is a violation of federal securities law an employee cannot trade on this information because of its seriousness trading on or tipping of confidential information about other companies will result in immediate termination of employment trading in openend mutual funds like the calamos mutual funds is generally permitted because the pricing of shares in these funds is done daily and has greater transparency than the pricing of other securities however there may be times when such trading would be improper based upon other information material nonpublic information about calamos if a director officer employee agent or consultant of calamos has material nonpublic information relating to cam or its securities it is cams policy that neither that person nor any related person as defined below may buy sell or recommend securities of cam the prohibition applies to market purchases and sales that are part of stock option exercises it is the responsibility of each employee to make sure that transactions in any covered security by any related person complies with the provisions of the code no director officer employee agent or consultant of calamos may disclose tip material nonpublic information about cam to any other person including related persons not authorized by calamos to have such information  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in addition no director officer employee agent or consultant of calamos may make recommendations or express opinions based on material nonpublic information regarding trading in cam securities confidentiality of nonpublic information about calamos nonpublic information relating to calamos is the property of calamos and the

any such inadvertent disclosure that comes to the attention of any calamos personnel  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the purchase and sale of securities by calamos personnel persons employed throughout the financial services industry are subject to restrictions on the way in which they can buy and sell securities for their own accounts these restrictions are imposed by the sec and other regulators on the assumption that industry employees have a greater opportunity for access to material nonpublic information than do employees in other types of businesses there are additional restrictions imposed on the trading of calamos personnel in securities of cam calamos has long had such restrictions on the personal securities trading activity of its personnel such

designed to protect calamos clients against potential misuse of material nonpublic information by calamos personnel that could disadvantage the client or enrich calamos personnel at the expense of clients additional restrictions apply to transactions in cam securities by calamos personnel these restrictions are required under federal law to protect shareholders of calamos from the potential misuse of material nonpublic information about calamos itself broadly speaking the provisions of the code with respect to the purchase and sale of securities of other companies apply equally to the purchase and sale of cam securities for example covered accounts that hold cam securities must be disclosed duplicate confirmations and statements must be provided and transactions in cam securities must be precleared however trading in cam securities by cam personnel and their related persons are limited to specific periods note that the de minimis exception applicable to securities of other companies does not apply to transactions in cam securities by cam personnel and their related persons every trade in cam securities must be preapproved blackout periods and trading windows quarterly blackout periods the period leading up to cams announcement of its quarterly financial results is a particularly sensitive period of time for trading in cam securities from the perspective of complying with applicable securities laws during this period directors officers and certain employees and consultants may often possess material nonpublic information about the expected financial results for the quarter as a result directors officers and employees of cam are prohibited from trading in cam securities and entering into trading plans including but not limited to dividend reinvestments during the period beginning on the first day of the last fiscal month of each fiscal quarter and ending at the close of trading on the nasdaq national market nasdaq on the second full

section  and the regulations thereunder as amended event specific blackout periods calamos reserves the right to impose other trading blackouts from time to time on specified groups of its directors officers employees agents or consultants when in the judgment of the cams general counsel a blackout period is warranted calamos will notify those affected by such a blackout of when the blackout begins and when it ends those affected should not disclose to others the fact of such trading suspension trading windows to avoid even the appearance of impropriety the most appropriate period for transactions in cam securities by directors officers employees agents and consultants who are routinely in possession of material nonpublic information about cam is the period beginning on the third full trading day through the twelfth trading day following each quarterly earnings release this trading window is based on the concept that cams disclosures to the investing public should be up to date and complete during that period the securities markets also should have had a sufficient opportunity to digest the disclosures in the quarterly release it should be noted that even during the trading windows any person possessing material nonpublic information concerning cam should not engage in any transactions in cam securities until such information has been known publicly for at least two full trading days whether or not cam has recommended a suspension of trading to that person trading in cam securities during the trading window should not be considered a safe harbor for purposes of the insider trading laws and all directors officers employees and other persons should use good judgment at all times and contact the chief compliance officer or general counsel if there are questions certain exceptions the prohibitions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information and during blackout periods do not apply to the following types of transactions in

other grants issued under cams incentive compensation plans  acquisition or disposition of stock in a stock split reverse stock split stock dividend or other transaction affecting all shareholders in a similar manner and  any other transaction designated by the general counsel of cam as exempt from the code prohibitions as an investment philosophy cam does not believe in speculation and speculation often leads to insider trading issues accordingly directors officers and employees of cam and its affiliates are prohibited from the following activities  purchases or sales of exchangelisted or otc options on cam stock  the exercise of an option or right to purchase cam shares or the sale of cam restricted stock which has vested is generally not permitted if the final exercise date or the sale date falls within a blackout period although certain transactions may be permitted depending upon specific circumstances  short term or day trading ie purchases and sales within a  day period of cam shares  short sales of cam shares other than shorting against the box any exceptions to these restrictions must be approved in writing by both the chief compliance officer and the general counsel of cam although margining and pledging of cam securities as collateral is not prohibited it is strongly discouraged in any margin or loan account the securities used as collateral may be sold without your  pexpnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd consent to meet a margin call or to satisfy a loan if such a sale occurs during a blackout period or when you have access to material nonpublic information it may result in unlawful insider trading because of this danger it is recommended that directors officers employees agents and consultants of cam not hold cam stock in a margin account or pledge cam stock as collateral for a loan additional requirements for directors and executive officers directors including outside directors and certain officers of cam and its affiliated companies as well as other personnel with regular access to cams financial information must obtain prior clearance from the general counsel of cam before engaging in any transaction in cam securities and securities of closedend funds managed by cam this includes trades within the trading windows described above a request should be made at least two business days in advance of the

the person is not in possession of material nonpublic information once the contract instruction or plan is adopted the person must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade in short it is similar to regularly scheduled purchases and reinvestments in or withdrawals from dividend reinvestment plans or similar programs the plan must either specify the amount pricing and timing of transactions when established or delegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party usually a broker such arrangements must be approved by the legal  compliance department prior to the first transaction section  reporting and prohibitions under the requirements of section  of the securities exchange act

exceptions an officer director or principal shareholder of cam who engages in any combination of purchase and sale or sale and purchase of a cam security within any period of less than six months must turn over to cam any profit realized or loss avoided by such a combination of transactions this is an absolute penalty imposed by law and it is imposed regardless of any intention on the part of the director officer or owner cams legal department is prepared to assist these persons in determining and satisfying their obligations under section  but that assistance can be offered only if the

responsibility for the timeliness and accuracy of reports again that assistance can be offered only if the transactions are reported to cams general counsel for preapproval  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th other regulatory requirements certain other restrictions are imposed upon calamos personnel other than outside trustees unaffiliated trustees and outside directors as a result of being in a highly regulated industry outside employment what employees do outside the office on their own time is their business as long as it does not reflect negatively on the company however for fulltime employees of calamos it is expected that their position with the company is their primary employment any outside activity must not interfere with an employees ability to properly perform his or her job responsibilities personnel contemplating a second job must notify their supervisor immediately the supervisor will thoroughly discuss this opportunity with the employee to ensure it will not interfere with job performance at calamos nor pose a conflict of interest all outside business activities must be approved by the department head and reported to the chief compliance officer via the completion of the notice of outside business activities form service as a director or officer no investment person or access person may serve as a member of the board of directors or trustees or as an officer of any publiclyheld company without the prior written approval of the president or the chief compliance officer based on a determination that the board service would not be inconsistent with the interests of the clients of cam if an investment person is serving as a board member that investment person shall not participate in making investment decisions relating to the securities of the company on whose board he or she sits because of the potential for real or apparent conflicts of interests such service is strongly discouraged gifts regulators require that calamos monitor the receipt and giving of gifts the regulatory concern is that the receipt or giving of gifts or excessive entertainment or favors could interfere with fiduciary judgment accepting gifts and entertainment except as otherwise specifically stated below an investment person access person or hisher family members must not accept excessive gifts entertainment or favors from current or prospective customers or suppliers of calamos cash gifts and checks or gift certificates convertible into cash are always inappropriate and must never be accepted other gifts up to  in retail value may be accepted if the investment person or access person is certain that there is no conflict of interest or appearance of any conflict of interest raised by the gifts if an employee receives a gift over a  retail value the employee must submit a written report to the chief compliance officer reports submitted to the chief compliance officer must contain the following information name of recipient title or position department name of donor description of gift date received actual or estimated value such reports are to be prepared and submitted immediately upon receipt of such gift senior management reserves the right to require the person to return any gift if it determines such return is appropriate under the circumstances invitations for excessive or extravagant entertainment must be declined if such entertainment is accepted inadvertently it must be reported in writing in accordance with the above guidelines employees should only accept types of entertainment that they believe would be deemed appropriate no gifts should be  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th accepted by one employee from another employee if accepting such gifts would create a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof if such gifts would be considered excessive or if such gifts are inappropriate or in bad taste presenting gifts and entertainment in situations where calamos is to present a gift entertainment or other accommodation to a current or prospective customer or supplier investment persons or access persons must use careful judgment to determine that the matter is handled in good taste and without excessive expense all entertainment presented by calamos or in the name of calamos must be appropriate and in good taste employees presenting a gift entertainment or accommodation must be certain that such gift entertainment or accommodation they have selected would be appropriate if there are any questions as to whether or not a particular form of gift entertainment or accommodation is appropriate such gift entertainment or accommodation should not be presented prior approval from the chief compliance officer is required before purchasing a gift with a retail value over  or the presentation of a gift combined with other gifts given to the same client during the calendar year would exceed  reports should include name of donor title or position department name of recipient description of gift date presented and actual value investment persons or access persons sometimes obtain calamosowned tickets to sporting or cultural events etc when an investment person or access person is accompanying a customer to the event using the calamosowned tickets the use of such tickets is considered to be customer entertainment when an investment person or access person presents such tickets to a customer but does not attend the event with the customer the presentation of such calamosowned tickets is then considered a gift to the customer in either event care must be taken to ensure that such gift or entertainment is an appropriate business expense for calamos it is expected that calamosowned tickets would not be repeatedly used to entertain or be presented as gifts to the same customer identifying actual or potential conflicts of interest calamos believes that the interests of calamos and its clients can and should be aligned despite the potential for conflicts of interest in the investment adviserclient relationship in addition to being in the best interests of our clients to avoid conflicts of interest it is in the best interest of calamos itself to avoid actual and even if possible potential conflicts of interest in a company of our size and complexity it can become difficult to identify conflicts of interest and other potential problems but identification is the first and most necessary step in resolving those issues calamos believes that those dealing with the details of running its business operations are in just as good a position  often a better one  as calamos management to identify potential problems all calamos employees have an interest in identifying and solving potential problems each employee should feel free to raise questions and analyze what he or she is doing in the end calamos is paying all of us to think and use our best judgment and that includes raising questions and joining the discussion that shapes our business policies and practices if any employee is concerned about an apparent conflict of interest or any other legal or ethical question involving our businesses we want to hear from you so that we can take the appropriate action calamos recognizes that some people may feel uncomfortable raising issues especially if they question the propriety of something that is occurring although people should not be afraid to raise these points openly as an alternative calamos has established the ethicspoint program for reporting and resolving issues under the calamos standards of conduct including conflicts of interest and other legal or ethical  pexpth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th issues under the ethicspoint program any employee can report any type of actual or suspected violation on an anonymous no retaliation basis the ethicspoint program which is described more completely on the calamos intranet site

performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio   cvpro  calamos convertible fund   principal investment strategies the fund invests mainly in a diversified portfolio of convertible securities issued by both us and foreign companies without regard to market capitalization these convertible securities may be either debt securities or preferred stocks that can be exchanged for common stock under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings in convertible securities the average term to maturity of the convertible securities purchased by the fund will typically range from two to ten years the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in foreign securities but generally will invest approximately  to  of net assets in foreign securities in analyzing the appreciation potential of the underlying common stock and the default risk of the convertible security the fund generally considers the issuers financial soundness ability to make interest and dividend payments earnings and cash flow forecast and quality of management the funds investment adviser seeks to lower the risks of investing in stocks by using a topdown approach of diversification by company industry sector country and currency and focusing on macrolevel investment themes consistent with the funds investment objective and principal investment strategies the funds investment adviser views the strategies as low volatility equity strategies and attempts to achieve equitylike returns with lower than equity market risk by managing a portfolio that it believes will exhibit less volatility over full market cycles principal risks an investment in the fund is subject to risks and you could lose money on your investment in the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives the risks associated with an investment in the fund can increase during times of significant market volatility your investment in the fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the principal risks of investing in the fund include      convertible securities risk  the value of a convertible security is influenced by changes in interest rates with investment value declining as interest rates increase and increasing as interest rates decline the credit standing of the issuer and other factors also may have an effect on the convertible securitys investment value      synthetic convertible instruments risk   the value of a synthetic convertible instrument will respond differently to market fluctuations than a convertible security because a synthetic convertible instrument is composed of two or more separate securities each with its own market value in addition if the value of the underlying common stock or the level of the index involved in the convertible component falls below the exercise price of the warrant or option the warrant or option may lose all value      foreign securities risk   risks associated with investing in foreign securities include fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies that may affect the us dollar value of a security the possibility of substantial price volatility as a result of political and economic instability in the foreign country less public information about issuers of securities different securities regulation different accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and less liquidity than in us markets      equity securities risk   the securities markets are volatile and the market prices of the funds securities may decline generally the price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a companys financial condition and overall market and economic conditions if the market prices of the securities owned by the fund fall the value of your investment in the fund will decline      interest rate risk   the value of fixedincome securities generally decreases in periods when interest rates are rising in addition interest rate changes typically have a greater effect on prices of longerterm fixedincome securities than shorterterm fixedincome securities      credit risk   an issuer of a fixedincome security could be downgraded or default if the fund holds securities that have been downgraded or that default on payment the funds performance could be negatively affected      high yield risk   high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality commonly known as junk bonds are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks high yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuers continuing ability to make principal and interest payments      portfolio selection risk   the value of your investment may decrease if the investment advisers judgment about the attractiveness value or market trends affecting a particular security issuer industry or sector or about market movements is incorrect      liquidity risk   liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell the funds investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price performance the following bar chart and table indicate the risks of investing in the fund by showing changes in the funds performance from calendar year to calendar year and how the funds average annual total returns compare with those of a broad measure of market performance all returns include the reinvestment of dividends and distributions as always please note

monthly periods the aftertax returns show the impact of assumed federal income taxes on an investment in the fund return after taxes on distributions shows the effect of taxable distributions but assumes that you still hold the fund shares at the end of the period and so do not have any taxable gain or loss on your investment return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares shows the effect of taxable distributions and any taxable gain or loss that would be realized if the fund shares were purchased at the beginning and sold at the end of the specified period the aftertax returns are shown only for class a shares are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes actual aftertax returns depend on an investors tax situation and may differ from those shown and the aftertax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through taxdeferred arrangements such as k plans or individual retirement accounts aftertax returns for classes other than class a will vary from returns shown for class a return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares may be higher than other returns for the same period due to a tax benefit of realizing a capital loss upon the sale of fund shares     average annual total returns for the periods ended
