the operation of the trust you may get more specific details concerning the nature structure and risks of this product in an information supplement by calling the sponsor at   dept code  how we created the trust on the initial date of deposit we deposited a portfolio of closedend funds with the trustee and in turn the trustee delivered documents to us representing our ownership of the trust in the form of units units after the initial date of deposit we may deposit additional securities in the trust or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to buy more securities in order to create new units for sale if we create additional units we will attempt to the extent practicable to maintain the percentage relationship established among the securities on the initial date of deposit as set forth in schedule of investments adjusted to reflect the sale redemption or liquidation of any of the securities or any stock split or a merger or other similar event affecting the issuer of the securities since the prices of the securities will fluctuate daily the ratio of securities in the trust on a market value basis will also change daily the portion of securities represented by each unit will not change as a result of the deposit of additional securities or cash in the trust if we deposit cash you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment this is because prices of securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust pays the associated brokerage fees to reduce this dilution the trust will try to buy the securities as close to the evaluation time and as close to the evaluation price as possible in addition because the trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and exchange requests frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses an affiliate of the trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the trustee may retain and pay us or our affiliate to act as agent for the trust to buy securities if we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to the trust we will be subject to the restrictions under the investment company act of  as amended the  act when acting in an agency capacity we may select various brokerdealers to execute securities transactions on behalf of the trust which may include brokerdealers who sell units of the trust we do not consider sales of units of the trust or any other products sponsored by first trust as a factor in selecting such brokerdealers we cannot guarantee that the trust will keep its present size and composition for any length of time securities may be periodically sold under certain circumstances to satisfy trust obligations to meet redemption requests and as described in removing securities from the trust to maintain the sound investment character of the trust and the proceeds received by the trust will be used to meet trust obligations or distributed to unit holders but will not be reinvested however securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation or if they no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected you will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in the trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and except as described in removing securities from the trust will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust neither we nor the trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the securities however if a contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in the trust fails unless we can purchase substitute securities replacement securities we will refund to you that portion of the purchase price and transactional sales charge resulting from the failed contract on the next income distribution date any replacement security the trust acquires will be identical to those from the failed contract page  portfolio objectives the trust seeks current income with total return as a secondary objective an important part of many investors overall strategy is to minimize taxes as the end of the year approaches investors with securities in taxable accounts typically review their portfolio for potential tax losses historically when taxmotivated selling pressures occur in december closedend fund cef discounts can widen further portfolio selection criteria the trust is a unit investment trust which invests in cefs that we believe may benefit once taxmotivated selling pressures abate after the end of the year the trust invests in taxable cefs which meet the following criteria  price decline  price decline of  or greater from each cefs  high at the time the portfolio is selected  discount to nav we select funds which are trading at a discount to net asset value and we favor those which are trading at a greater discount relative to their peers  liquidity  a funds overall size must be considered as well as its average trading volume we favor larger funds and funds with higher trading volume  dividend yield we look for funds with higher dividend yields relative to comparable funds as well as those that have shown a relatively stable payment level over time  diversification  in order to cover the broadest scope of the market we diversify among fund companies and categories diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss closedend fund selection the closedend funds were selected by our research department based on a number of factors including but not limited to the size and liquidity of the closedend fund the current dividend yield of the closedend fund the quality and character of the securities held by the closedend fund and the expense ratio of the closedend fund while attempting to limit the overlap of the securities held by the closedend funds you should be aware that predictions stated herein may not be realized of course as with any similar investment there can be no guarantee that the objectives of the trust will be achieved see risk factors for a discussion of the risks of investing in the trust risk factors principal risks the following is a discussion of the principal risks of investing in the trust price volatility the trust invests in closedend funds the value of the trusts units will fluctuate with changes in the value of these securities the value of a security fluctuates for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur because the trust is not managed the trustee will not sell securities in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations as is common in managed investments as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time or that you wont lose money units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency current economic conditions the global economy continues to experience subdued growth most developed and developing economies are continuing to struggle against the lingering effects of the financial crisis which began in  grappling in particular with the challenges of taking appropriate fiscal and monetary policy actions inflation remains tame worldwide partly reflecting output gaps high unemployment and a continued financial deleveraging in major developed economies the global employment situation remains challenging as longlasting effects from the financial crisis continue to weigh on labor markets in many countries and regions prices of most primary commodities a driving force behind many emerging market economies have declined moderately in recent years mainly driven by generally weak global demand as global economic growth remains anemic the financial crisis began with problems in the us housing and credit markets many of which were caused by defaults on subprime mortgages and mortgagebacked securities eventually leading to the failures of some large financial institutions and has negatively impacted most sectors of the global economy recently falling oil and other commodity prices subdued growth in china and other emerging markets and uncertain economic forecasts for the united states and a number of developed countries have contributed to page  significant market volatility worldwide the united kingdom vote to leave the european union brexit and other recent rapid political and social change throughout europe make the extent and nature of future economic development in europe and the effect on securities issued by european issuers difficult to predict the election of a republican president and a republicancontrolled congress could result in significant changes to government policies regulatory environments and other conditions which are difficult to predict and could negatively impact certain of the issuers of the securities held by the trust due to the current state of uncertainty in the economy the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers to combat the financial crisis central banks in the united states europe and asia have held interest rates at historically low levels for several years however there is no assurance that this will continue in the future and no way to predict how quickly interest rates will rise once central banks change their current position in addition other extraordinary steps have been taken by the governments of several leading economic countries to combat the financial crisis however the impact of these measures has been mixed and in certain instances has produced unintended consequences distributions as stated under summary of essential information the trust will generally make monthly distributions of income the funds held by the trust make distributions on a monthly or quarterly basis as a result of changing interest rates refundings sales or defaults on the underlying securities held by the funds and other factors there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time closedend funds the trust invests in shares of closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue shares of common stock that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors investment in other investment companies risk because the trust holds funds unit holders are subject to the risk that the securities selected by the funds investment advisors will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds further funds may in the future invest in other types of securities which involve risk which may differ from those set forth below in addition because the trust holds funds unit holders bear both their proportionate share of the expenses of the trust and indirectly the expenses of the funds certain of the funds held by the trust may invest a relatively high percentage of their assets in a limited number of issuers as a result these funds may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers common stocks certain of the funds held by the trust invest in common stocks common stocks represent a proportional share of ownership in a company common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur common stock prices may also be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase convertible securities certain of the funds held by the trust invest in convertible securities convertible securities are bonds preferred stocks and other securities that pay interest or dividends and are convertible into common stocks as such convertible securities have some characteristics of both bonds and common stocks like a bond or some preferred stocks a convertible security typically pays a fixed rate of interest or dividends and promises to repay principal at a given date in the future however an investor can exchange the convertible security for a specific number of shares of the issuing companys common stock at a conversion price specified at the time the convertible security is issued companies that issue convertible securities often do not have high credit ratings in addition the credit rating of a companys convertible securities is typically lower than the rating of the companys conventional debt securities because convertibles are normally considered junior or subordinate securities convertible securities are predominantly highyield securities convertible securities are typically page  issued at prices which represent a premium to their conversion value accordingly the value of the convertible security increases or decreases as the price of the underlying common stock increases or decreases convertible securities typically pay income yields that are higher than the dividend yields of the issuers common stock but lower than the yields of the issuers debt securities in general a convertible security performs more like a stock when the underlying common stocks price is closer to the conversion price of the convertible security because it is assumed that it will be converted into the stock and more like a bond when the underlying common stocks price is significantly lower than the convertible securitys conversion price because it is assumed that it will not be converted for these reasons unit holders must be willing to accept the market risks of both bonds and common stocks however because convertible securities have characteristics of both common stocks and bonds they tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than bonds of comparable maturity and quality and less sensitive to stock market changes than common stocks because of these factors and the hybrid nature of convertible securities unit holders should recognize that convertible securities are likely to perform quite differently than broadlybased measures of the stock and bond markets while all markets are prone to change over time the generally high rate at which convertible securities are retired through conversion or redemption and replaced with newly issued convertible securities causes the convertible securities market to change more rapidly than other markets due to the smaller less liquid market for convertible securities the bidoffer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade bonds and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete moreover convertible securities with innovative structures such as mandatory conversion securities and equitylinked securities have increased the sensitivity of this market to the volatility of the equity markets and to the special risks of those innovations no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any convertible security because these securities generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange highyield securities certain of the funds held by the trust invest in securities rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies high yield securities or junk bonds highyield securities held by funds represent approximately  of the underlying assets of the trust high yield highrisk securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings the value of these securities will decline significantly with increases in interest rates not only because increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments highyield securities or junk bonds the generic names for securities rated below bbb by standard  poors or below baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established companies that are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed obligations rated below bbb should be considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared to investment grade issues because highyield securities are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated securities their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree the market for highyield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the overthecounter markets due to the smaller less liquid market for highyield securities the bidoffer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete investment grade securities certain of the funds held by the trust invest in investment grade securities the value of these securities will decline with increases in interest rates not only because increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments master limited partnerships mlps certain of the funds held by the trust invest in mlps mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests limited partnership units or limited liability company units are traded on securities exchanges like page  shares of common stock an mlp consists of a general partner and limited partners the general partner manages the partnership has an ownership stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive distribution the limited partners provide capital to the partnership have a limited if any role in the operation and management of the partnership and receive cash distributions the trusts investment in funds that hold mlps which are required to distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order to not be subject to entity level taxation often offers a yield advantage over other types of securities currently most mlps operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors investments in mlp interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors including commodity pricing risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk there are certain tax risks associated with mlps in which the funds held by the trust may invest including the risk that us taxing authorities could challenge the trusts treatment for federal income tax purposes of the mlps in which the funds held by the trust invest these tax risks and any adverse determination with respect thereto could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps andor the value of the trusts investments mortgagebacked securities certain of the funds held by the trust invest in mortgagebacked securities mortgagebacked securities represent direct or indirect participations in or are secured by and payable from mortgage loans secured by real property and can include single and multiclass passthrough securities and collateralized mortgage obligations mortgagebacked securities are based on different types of mortgages including those on commercial real estate or residential properties these securities often have stated maturities of up to thirty years when they are issued depending upon the length of the mortgages underlying the securities in practice however unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on the underlying mortgages may make the securities effective maturity shorter than this rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgagebacked securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates and may reduce the market value of the securities in addition mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment risk the risk that borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected particularly when interest rates decline this can reduce the funds and therefore the trusts returns because the funds may have to reinvest that money at lower prevailing interest rates options certain of the funds held by the trust invest in call options the value of an option may be adversely affected if the market for the option becomes less liquid or smaller and will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the stock subject to the option an increase in interest rates a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the common stock and the remaining time to expiration additionally the value of an option does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying stock although they generally move in the same direction however as an option approaches its expiration date its value increasingly moves with the price of the stock subject to an option the strike price for an option may be adjusted downward before an option expiration triggered by certain corporate events affecting that stock a downward adjustment to the strike price will have the effect of reducing the equity appreciation option strike prices may be adjusted to reflect certain corporate events such as extraordinary dividends stock splits merger or other extraordinary distributions or events if the value of the underlying stock exceeds the strike price of an option it is likely that the holder of that option will exercise their right to purchase the stock preferred securities certain of the funds held by the trust invest in preferred stocks preferred stocks are unique securities that combine some of the characteristics of both common stocks and bonds preferred stocks generally pay a fixed rate of return and are sold on the basis of current yield like bonds however because they are equity securities preferred stocks provide equity ownership of a company and the income is paid in the form of dividends preferred stocks typically have a yield advantage over common stocks as well as comparablyrated fixed income investments preferred stocks are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments senior loan securities senior loans certain of the funds held by the trust invest in senior loans issued by banks other financial institutions and other investors to corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts recapitalizations mergers acquisitions stock repurchases debt refinancings and to a lesser extent for general operating and other purposes an investment in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation page  of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of non payment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans are typically structured as floatingrate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment senior loans are generally below investment grade quality and may be unrated at the time of investment are generally not registered with the sec or state securities commissions and are generally not listed on any securities exchange see risk factorshighyield securities for a description of the risks involved in investing in below investment grade securities in addition the amount of public information available on senior loans is generally less extensive than that available for other types of assets foreign securities certain of the funds held by the trust invest in securities issued by foreign entities which makes the trust subject to more risks than if it only invested in funds which invest solely in domestic securities a foreign security is either directly listed on a us securities exchange is in the form of an american depositary receiptadr or a global depositary receiptgdr which trades on the overthecounter market or is listed on a us or foreign securities exchange or is directly listed on a foreign securities exchange risks of foreign securities include higher brokerage costs different accounting standards expropriation nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments currency devaluations blockages or transfer restrictions restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities inadequate financial information lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries certain foreign markets have experienced heightened volatility due to recent negative political or economic developments or natural disasters securities issued by nonus issuers may pay interest andor dividends in foreign currencies and may be principally traded in foreign currencies therefore there is a risk that the us dollar value of these interest andor dividend payments andor securities will vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates investments in debt securities of foreign governments present special risks including the fact that issuers may be unable or unwilling to repay principal andor interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt or may be unable to make such repayments when due in the currency required under the terms of the debt political economic and social events also may have a greater impact on the price of debt securities issued by foreign governments than on the price of us securities american depositary receiptsadrs global depositary receiptsgdrs and similarly structured securities may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary issuers of depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is considered material in the united states as a result there may be less information available regarding such issuers holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert shares into depositary receipts and vice versa such restrictions may cause shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts emerging markets certain of the funds held by the trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered in countries considered to be emerging markets risks of investing in developing or emerging countries are even greater than the risks associated with foreign investments in general these increased risks include among other risks the possibility of investment and trading limitations greater liquidity concerns higher price volatility greater delays and disruptions in settlement transactions greater political uncertainties and greater dependence on international trade or development assistance in addition emerging market countries may be subject to overburdened infrastructures obsolete financial systems and environmental problems for these reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative small andor mid capitalization companies certain of the funds held by the trust invest in small andor mid capitalization companies investing in stocks of such companies may involve greater risk than investing in larger companies for example such companies may have limited product lines as well as shorter operating histories less experienced management and more limited financial resources than larger companies securities of such companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable changes in price than securities of larger companies in addition small and midcap stocks may not be widely followed by the investment community which may result in low demand interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the securities held by the funds held by the trust will fall if interest rates page  increase securities typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall securities with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk credit risk is the risk that a securitys issuer is unable or unwilling to make dividend interest or principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments call risk call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher than market interest rate or if the issuer no longer needs the money for its original purpose a bonds call price could be less than the price the fund paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means a fund could receive less than the amount paid for the bond and may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in securities with as high a yield as the called bond a fund may contain bonds that have make whole call options that generally cause the bonds to be redeemable at any time at a designated price such bonds are generally more likely to be subject to early redemption and may result in the reduction of income received by the fund extension risk if interest rates rise certain obligations may be paid off by the obligor at a slower rate than expected which will cause the value of such obligations to fall leverage risk certain of the funds held by the trust employ the use of leverage in their portfolios leverage may be structural leverage through borrowings or the issuance of preferred stock or effective leverage which results from a funds investment in derivative instruments that are inherently leveraged while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a fund this leverage also subjects the fund to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the securities held by the trust will fluctuate market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securities issuer perceptions of the issuer ratings on a bond or political or economic events affecting the issuer because the trust is not managed the trustee will not sell securities in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations as is common in managed investments prepayment risk many types of debt instruments are subject to prepayment risk which is the risk that the issuer will repay principal prior to the maturity date debt instruments allowing prepayment may offer less potential for gains during a period of declining interest rates legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the trusts investments in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the value of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the trusts investments additional risks the following is a discussion of additional risks of investing in the trust short sales risk a fund may engage in short sale transactions a fund will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value a fund also may enter into a short derivative position through a futures contract if the price of the security or derivative that is the subject of a short sale increases then the fund will incur a loss equal to the increase in price from the time that the short sale was entered into plus any premiums and interest paid to a third party in connection with the short sale therefore short sales involve the risk that losses may be exaggerated potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment also there is the risk that the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms causing a loss to the fund public offering the public offering price units will be purchased at the public offering price the price per unit of which is comprised of the following  the aggregate underlying value of the securities  the amount of any cash in the income and capital accounts  dividends receivable on securities and  the maximum sales charge which combines a deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee page  the price you pay for your units will differ from the amount stated under summary of essential information due to various factors including fluctuations in the prices of the securities and changes in the value of the income andor capital accounts although you are not required to pay for your units until three business days following your order the date of settlement you may pay before then you will become the owner of units record owner on the date of settlement if payment has been received if you pay for your units before the date of settlement we may use your payment during this time and it may be considered a benefit to us subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  as amended organization costs securities purchased with the portion of the public offering price intended to be used to reimburse the sponsor for the trusts organization costs including costs of preparing the registration statement the indenture and other closing documents registering units with the sec and states the initial audit of the trusts statement of net assets legal fees and the initial fees and expenses of the trustee will be purchased in the same proportionate relationship as all the securities contained in the trust securities will be sold to reimburse the sponsor for the trusts organization costs at the earlier of six months after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period a significantly shorter time period than the life of the trust during the period ending with the earlier of six months after the initial date of deposit or the end of the initial offering period there may be a decrease in the value of the securities to the extent the proceeds from the sale of these securities are insufficient to repay the sponsor for trust organization costs the trustee will sell additional securities to allow the trust to fully reimburse the sponsor in that event the net asset value per unit of the trust will be reduced by the amount of additional securities sold although the dollar amount of the reimbursement due to the sponsor will remain fixed and will never exceed the per unit amount set forth for the trust in notes to statement of net assets this will result in a greater effective cost per unit to unit holders for the reimbursement to the sponsor to the extent actual organization costs are less than the estimated amount only the actual organization costs will ultimately be charged to the trust when securities are sold to reimburse the sponsor for organization costs the trustee will sell securities to the extent practicable which will maintain the same proportionate relationship among the securities contained in the trust as existed prior to such sale minimum purchase the minimum amount per account you can purchase of the trust is generally  worth of units  if you are purchasing units for your individual retirement account or any other qualified retirement plan but such amounts may vary depending on your selling firm maximum sales charge the maximum sales charge during the initial offering period consists of a deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee both the deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit because of this the maximum sales charge as a percentage of the public offering price will vary with changes in the public offering price at a public offering price of  per unit the maximum sales charge will be  if the price you pay for your units exceeds  per unit the maximum sales charge will be less than  if the price you pay for your units is less than  per unit the maximum sales charge will exceed  but in no event will the maximum sales charge exceed  transactional sales charge the transactional sales charge you will pay is initially comprised of solely the deferred sales charge if you purchase units after the first deferred sales charge payment has been assessed the transactional sales charge will also contain an initial sales charge as described below monthly deferred sales charge the deferred sales charge is equal to  per unit three monthly deferred sales charges of  per unit will be deducted from the trusts assets on approximately the twentieth day of each month from january   through march   if you buy units at a price of less than  per unit the dollar amount of the deferred sales charge will not change but the deferred sales charge on a percentage basis will be more than  of the public offering price but in no event will the maximum deferred sales charge exceed  if you purchase units after the first deferred sales charge payment has been assessed your maximum sales charge will consist of an initial sales charge and the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge payments the initial sales charge which you will pay at the time of purchase is equal to the difference between  of the public offering price and the sum of the maximum remaining deferred sales charge if you purchase units after the last deferred sales charge payment has been assessed your maximum sales charge will consist of a onetime initial sales charge of  of the public offering price per unit equivalent to  of the net amount invested the page  maximum sales charge will be reduced by  of  on each subsequent december  commencing december   to a minimum transactional sales charge of  creation and development fee as sponsor we will also receive and the unit holders will pay a creation and development fee see expenses and charges for a description of the services provided for this fee the creation and development fee is a charge of  per unit collected at the end of the initial offering period if you buy units at a price of less than  per unit the dollar amount of the creation and development fee will not change but the creation and development fee on a percentage basis will be more than  of the public offering price discounts for certain persons the maximum sales charge is  per unit and the maximum dealer concession is  per unit however if you invest at least

trusts or portfolio securities according to capitalization andor investment style the sponsors profits we will receive a gross sales commission equal to the maximum transactional sales charge per unit of the trust less any reduction as stated in public offering we will also receive the amount of any collected creation and development fee also any difference between our cost to purchase the securities and the price at which we sell them to the trust is considered a profit or loss see note  of schedule of investments during the initial offering period dealers and others may also realize profits or sustain losses as a result of fluctuations in the public offering price they receive when they sell the units in maintaining a market for the units any difference between the price at which we purchase units and the price at which we sell or redeem them will be a profit or loss to us the secondary market although not obligated we may maintain a market for the units after the initial offering period and continuously offer to purchase units at prices based on the redemption price per unit we will pay all expenses to maintain a secondary market except the evaluator fees and trustee

purchase units the trustee will notify us of any tender of units for redemption if our bid at that time is equal to or greater than the redemption price per unit we may purchase the units you will receive your proceeds from the sale no later than page  if they were redeemed by the trustee we may tender units we hold to the trustee for redemption as any other units if we elect not to purchase units the trustee may sell tendered units in the overthecounter market if any however the amount you will receive is the same as you would have received on redemption of the units expenses and charges the estimated annual expenses of the trust are listed under fee table if actual expenses exceed the estimate the trust will bear the excess the trustee will pay operating expenses of the trust from the income account if funds are available and then from the capital account the income and capital accounts are noninterestbearing to unit holders so the trustee may earn interest on these funds thus benefiting from their use in addition investors will also indirectly pay a portion of the expenses of the underlying funds first trust advisors lp an affiliate of ours acts as portfolio supervisor and evaluator and will be compensated for providing portfolio supervisory services and evaluation services as well as bookkeeping and other administrative services to the trust in providing portfolio

when the trust uses us or an affiliate of ours as agent in buying or selling securities as authorized by the indenture the trustee may employ a subsidiary or affiliate of the trustee to act as broker to execute certain transactions for the trust the trust will pay for such services at standard commission rates the fees payable to first trust advisors lp and the trustee are based on the largest aggregate number of units of the trust outstanding at any time during the calendar year except during the initial offering period in which case these fees are calculated based on the largest number of units outstanding during the period for which compensation is paid these fees may be adjusted for inflation without unit holders approval but in no case will the annual fee paid to us or our affiliates for providing services to all unit investment trusts be more than the actual cost of providing such services in such year as sponsor we will receive a fee from the trust for creating and developing the trust including determining the trusts objectives policies composition and size selecting service providers and information services and for providing other similar administrative and ministerial functions the creation and development fee is a charge of  per unit outstanding at the end of the initial offering period the trustee will deduct this amount from the trusts assets as of the close of the initial offering period we do not use this fee to pay distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts this fee will not be deducted from your proceeds if you sell or redeem your units before the end of the initial offering period in addition to the trusts operating expenses and those fees described above the trust may also incur the following charges  all legal expenses

custodial and transaction fees which may include compensation paid to the trustee or its subsidiaries or affiliates if any andor  all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the securities or any part of the trust the above expenses and the trustees annual fee are secured by a lien on the trust in addition if there is not enough cash in the income or capital account the trustee has the power to sell securities to make cash available to pay these charges which may result in capital gains or losses to you see tax status tax status federal tax matters this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example except as specifically provided below these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a page  brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section may not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company commonly known as a ric under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a ric and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes for federal income tax purposes you are treated as the owner of trust units and not of the assets held by the trust taxability issues are taken into account at the trust level your federal income tax treatment of income from the trust is based on the distributions paid by the trust income from the trust trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates the trusts distributions into ordinary dividends capital gains dividends and returns of capital income reported is generally net of expenses but see deductibility of trust expenses below ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from the trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from the trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a  medicare tax this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals distributions with respect to certain stock dividends ordinary income dividends received by an individual unit holder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed below provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself dividends that do not meet these requirements will generally be taxed at ordinary income rates the trust will provide notice to its unit holders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units the information statement you receive in regard to the sale or redemption of your units may contain information about your basis in the units and whether any gain or loss recognized by you should be considered longterm or short term capital gain the information reported to you is based upon rules that do not take into consideration all facts that may be known to you or your page  advisors you should consult with your tax advisors about any adjustments that may need to be made to the information reported to you capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  or  tax brackets an additional  medicare tax may also apply to gain from the sale or redemption of units of the trust subject to the income thresholds as described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from the trust and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered unrecaptured section  gain is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of  in the case of capital gains dividends the determination of which portion of the capital gains dividend if any is subject to the  tax rate will be made based on rules prescribed by the united states treasury inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units at any time prior to  business days before the trusts mandatory termination date by electing to receive an inkind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash this distribution is subject to taxation and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the irs could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by the trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income also certain individuals may also be subject to a phaseout of the deductibility of itemized deductions based upon their income investments in certain foreign corporations if the trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unit holders similarly if the trust invests in a fund a portfolio fund that invests in pfics the portfolio fund may be subject to such taxes the trust will not be able to pass through to its unit holders any credit or deduction for such taxes whenever the taxes are imposed at the trust level or on a portfolio fund the trust or the portfolio fund may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust or the portfolio fund would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust or the portfolio fund might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that

calendar year the trustee will prepare a statement which contains the following information  a summary of transactions in the trust for the year  a list of any securities sold during the year and the

unit holders of record determined as of the close of business on the record date for that distribution or if the record date is a day on which the nyse is closed the first preceding day on which the

three business days after the day you tender your units the date of tender you will receive cash in an amount for each unit equal to the redemption price per unit calculated at the evaluation time on the date of tender the date of tender is considered to be the date on which your redemption request is received by the trustee from the brokerdealer or bank through which you hold your units if such day is a day the nyse is open for trading page  however if the redemption request is received after  pm eastern time or after any earlier closing time on a day on which the nyse is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time the date of tender is the next day the nyse is open for trading any amounts paid on redemption representing income will be withdrawn from the income account if funds are available for that purpose or from the capital account all other amounts paid on redemption will be taken from the capital account the irs will require the trustee to withhold a portion of your redemption proceeds if the trustee does not have your tin as generally discussed under income and capital distributions if you tender for redemption at least  units or such larger amount as required by your brokerdealer or bank rather than receiving cash you may elect to receive an inkind distribution in an amount equal to the redemption price per unit by making this request to your

tax status for additional information the trustee may sell securities to make funds available for redemption if securities are sold the size and diversification of the trust will be reduced these

than customary weekend and holiday closings  if the sec determines that trading on the nyse is restricted or that an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practical or  for any other period permitted by sec order the trustee is not liable to any person for any loss or damage which may result from such a suspension or postponement the redemption price

any remaining deferred sales charge on the units when you redeem them will be deducted from your redemption proceeds in addition until they are collected the redemption price per unit will include estimated organization costs as set forth under fee table removing securities from the trust the portfolio of the trust is not managed however we may but are not required to direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain limited circumstances including situations in which  the issuer of the security defaults in the payment of a declared dividend  any action or proceeding prevents the payment of dividends  there is any legal question or impediment affecting the security  the issuer of the security has breached a covenant which would affect the page  payment of dividends the issuers credit standing or otherwise damage the sound investment character of the security  the issuer has defaulted on the payment of any other of its outstanding obligations  there has been a public tender offer made for a security or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security and that in our opinion the sale or tender of the security is in the best interest of unit holders  the sale of securities is necessary or advisable i in order to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or ii to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on undistributed income in the trust  the price of the security has declined to such an extent or such other credit factors exist that in our opinion keeping the security would be harmful to the trust  as a result of the ownership of the security the trust or its unit holders would be a direct or indirect shareholder of a passive foreign investment company or  the sale of the security is necessary for the trust to comply with such federal andor state securities laws regulations andor regulatory actions and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time except for instances in which the trust acquires replacement securities as described in the ft series the trust will generally not acquire any securities or other property other than the securities the trustee on behalf of the trust and at the direction of the sponsor will vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for a security such as those acquired in a merger or other transaction if such exchanged securities or property are acquired by the trust at our instruction they will either be sold or held in the trust in making the determination as to whether to sell or hold the exchanged securities or property we may get advice from the portfolio supervisor any proceeds received from the sale of securities exchanged securities or property will be credited to the capital account of the trust for distribution to unit holders or to meet redemption requests the trustee may retain and pay us or an affiliate of ours to act as agent for the trust to facilitate selling securities exchanged securities or property from the trust if we or our affiliate act in this capacity we will be held subject to the restrictions under the  act when acting in an agency capacity we may select various brokerdealers to execute securities transactions on behalf of the trust which may include brokerdealers who sell units of the trust we do not consider sales of units of the trust or any other products sponsored by first trust as a factor in selecting such brokerdealers as authorized by the indenture the trustee may also employ a subsidiary or affiliate of the trustee to act as broker in selling such securities or property the trust will pay for these brokerage services at standard commission rates the trustee may sell securities designated by us or absent our direction at its own discretion in order to meet redemption requests or pay expenses in designating securities to be sold we will try to maintain the proportionate relationship among the securities if this is not possible the composition and diversification of the trust may be changed amending or terminating the indenture amendments the indenture may be amended by us and the trustee without your consent  to cure ambiguities  to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision  to make any amendment required by any governmental agency or  to make other changes determined not to be adverse to your best interests as determined by us and the trustee termination as provided by the indenture the trust will terminate on the mandatory termination date as stated in the summary of essential information the trust may be terminated earlier  upon the consent of  of the unit holders of the trust  if the value of the securities owned by the trust as shown by any evaluation is less than the lower of  or  of the total value of securities deposited in the trust during the initial offering period discretionary liquidation amount or  in the event that units of the trust not yet sold aggregating more than  of the units of such trust are tendered for redemption by underwriters including the sponsor if the trust is terminated due to this last reason we will refund your entire sales charge however termination of the trust before the mandatory termination date for any other stated reason will result in all remaining unpaid deferred sales charges on your units being deducted from your termination proceeds for various reasons the trust may be reduced below the page  discretionary liquidation amount and could therefore be terminated before the mandatory termination date unless terminated earlier the trustee will begin to sell securities in connection with the termination of the trust during the period beginning nine business days prior to and no later than the mandatory termination date we will determine the manner and timing of the sale of securities because the trustee must sell the securities within a relatively short period of time the sale of securities as part of the termination process may result in a lower sales price than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at this time you will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining securities along with your interest in the income and capital accounts within a reasonable time after the trust is terminated the

initial date of deposit trust preferred securities an investment in trust preferred securities should be made with an understanding of the risks which such an investment entails holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities that are typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities the maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures trust preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary circumstances at any time trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks distributions on the trust preferred securities are treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes unlike most preferred stocks distributions received from trust preferred securities are not eligible for the dividends received deduction certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities include i distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made ii a corporation issuing the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up to  consecutive quarters and if such election is made distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period iii certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date iv future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes making redemption of these instruments likely v a corporation may redeem the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a stated call date vi trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights and vii payment of interest on the interestbearing notes page  preferred securities or subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation reits an investment in reits should be made with an understanding of the risks which such an investment entails generally these include economic recession the cyclical nature of real estate markets competitive overbuilding unusually adverse weather conditions changing demographics changes in governmental regulations including tax laws and environmental building zoning and sales regulations increases in real estate taxes or costs of material and labor the inability to secure performance guarantees or insurance as required the unavailability of investment capital and the inability to obtain construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable to builders and purchasers of real estate additional risks include an inability to reduce expenditures associated with a property such as mortgage payments and property taxes when rental revenue declines and possible loss upon foreclosure of mortgaged properties if mortgage payments are not paid when due reits are financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a number of investors in order to participate directly in real estate ownership or financing reits are generally fully integrated operating companies that have interests in incomeproducing real estate equity reits emphasize direct property investment holding their invested assets primarily in the ownership of real estate or other equity interests reits obtain capital funds for investment in underlying real estate assets by selling debt or equity securities in the public or institutional capital markets or by bank borrowing thus the returns on common equities of reits will be significantly affected by changes in costs of capital and particularly in the case of highly leveraged reits ie those with large amounts of borrowings outstanding by changes in the level of interest rates the objective of an equity reit is to purchase incomeproducing real estate properties in order to generate high levels of cash flow from rental income and a gradual asset appreciation and they typically invest in properties such as office retail industrial hotel and apartment buildings and healthcare facilities reits are a creation of the tax law reits essentially operate as a corporation or business trust with the advantage of exemption from corporate income taxes provided the reit satisfies the requirements of sections  through  of the internal revenue code the major tests for taxqualified status are that the reit i be managed by one or more trustees or directors ii issue shares of transferable interest to its owners iii have at least  shareholders iv have no more than  of the shares held by five or fewer individuals v invest substantially all of its capital in real estate related assets and derive substantially all of its gross income from real estate related assets and vi distributed at least  of its taxable income to its shareholders each year if a reit should fail to qualify for such tax status the related shareholders including such trust could be adversely affected by the resulting tax consequences the underlying value of reits and their ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by changes in national economic conditions changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics increased competition from other properties obsolescence of property changes in the availability cost and terms of mortgage funds the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental

event of rising interest rates reits may concentrate investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types ie hotels shopping malls residential complexes office buildings and timberlands the impact of economic conditions on reits can also be expected to vary with geographic location and property type investors should be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects reits are also subject to defaults by borrowers self liquidation the markets perception of the reit industry generally and the possibility of failing to qualify for passthrough of income under the internal revenue code and to maintain exemption from the investment company act of  a default by a borrower or lessee may cause a reit to experience delays in enforcing its right as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs related to protecting its investments in addition because real estate generally is subject to real property taxes reits may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in property tax rates and assessments or reassessments of the properties underlying reits by taxing authorities furthermore because real estate is

allow investors to purchase and sell individual etf shares among themselves at market prices throughout the day the trust will purchase and sell etf shares on these securities exchanges etfs therefore

the price of the units of a trust there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful during any period in which it is employed convertible securities the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities which invest in convertible securities convertible securities include convertible subordinated debentures and corporate bonds convertible bonds and cumulative convertible preferred stocks convertible preferred stocks convertible securities contain a conversion privilege which under specified circumstances offers the holder the right to exchange such security for common stock of the issuing corporation convertible bonds obligate the issuing company to pay a stated annual rate of interest or a stated dividend in the case of convertible preferred stocks and to return the principal amount after a specified period of time the income offered by convertible securities is generally higher than the dividends received from the underlying common stock but lower than similar quality nonconvertible debt securities convertible securities are usually priced at a premium to their conversion value ie the value of the common stock received if the holder were to exchange the convertible security the holder of the convertible security may choose at any time to exchange the convertible security for a specified number of shares of the common stock of the corporation or occasionally a subsidiary company at a specified price as defined by the corporation when the security is issued accordingly the value of the convertible obligation may generally be expected to increase decrease as the price of the associated common stock increases decreases also the market value of convertible securities tends to be influenced by the level of interest rates and tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline convertible securities rank senior to common stocks in an issuers capital structure but are junior to nonconvertible debt securities as convertible securities are considered junior to any nonconvertible debt securities issued by the corporation convertible securities are typically rated by established credit ratings agencies at one level below the rating on such corporations nonconvertible debt convertible securities are hybrid securities combining the investment characteristics of both bonds and common stock like a bond or preferred stock a convertible security pays interest at a fixed rate dividend but may be converted into common stock at a specified price or conversion rate when the conversion price of the convertible security is significantly above the price of the issuers common stock a convertible security takes on the risk characteristics of a bond at such times the price of a convertible security will vary inversely with changes in the level of interest rates in other words when interest rates rise prices of convertible securities will generally fall conversely when interest rates fall prices of convertible securities will generally rise this interest rate risk is in part offset by the income paid by the convertible securities in contrast when the conversion price of a convertible security and the common stock price are close to one another a convertible security will behave like a common stock in such cases the prices of convertible securities may exhibit the shortterm price volatility characteristic of common stocks for these reasons unit holders must be willing to accept the market risks of both bonds and common stocks however because convertible securities have characteristics of both common stocks and bonds they tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than bonds of comparable maturity and quality and less sensitive to stock market changes than fully invested common stock portfolios because of these factors and the hybrid nature of convertible securities unit holders should recognize that convertible securities are likely to perform quite differently than broadlybased measures of the stock and bond markets the market for convertible securities includes a larger proportion of small to mediumsize companies than the broad stock market as measured by such indices as the standard  poors  composite stock price index companies which issue convertible securities are often lower in credit quality typically rated below investment grade moreover the credit rating of a companys convertible issuance is generally lower than the rating of the companys conventional debt issues since the convertible security is normally a junior security securities with such ratings are considered speculative and thus pose a greater risk of default than investment grade securities highrisk securities may be thinly traded which can adversely affect the prices at which such securities can be sold and can result in high transaction costs judgment plays a greater role in valuing high risk securities than securities for which more extensive quotations and last sale information are available adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may affect the ability of outside price services to value securities page  during an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates the ability of issuers of debt to serve their payment obligations meet projected goals or obtain additional financing may be impaired convertible securities are subject to the risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the convertible securities or the general condition of the stock market or bond market may worsen and the value of the convertible securities and therefore the value of the units may decline convertible securities may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic or banking crises convertible preferred stocks are also subject to congressional reductions in the dividends received deduction which would adversely affect the aftertax return to the corporate investors who can take advantage of the deduction such reductions also might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general holders of preferred stocks have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or in some cases senior preferred stocks of such issuers convertible preferred stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income since dividends on a preferred stock must be declared by the issuers board of directors or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock the issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the convertible preferred stocks in the funds may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the date of deposit holders of convertible preferred stocks incur more risk than holders of debt obligations because preferred stockholders as owners of the entity have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of or holders of debt obligations issued by the issuer convertible bonds are typically subordinated debentures and therefore the claims of senior creditors must be settled in full before any payment will be made to holders of convertible bonds in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy senior creditors typically include all other longterm debt issuers and bank loans convertible bonds do however have a priority over common and preferred stock investors in convertible bonds pay for the conversion privilege by accepting a significantly lower yieldtomaturity than that concurrently offered by nonconvertible bonds of equivalent quality whether or not the convertible securities are listed on a national securities exchange the principal trading market for the convertible securities may be in the overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market for the convertible securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the convertible securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the convertible securities that any market for the convertible securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the convertible securities in any markets made issues of convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks generally provide that the convertible security may be liquidated either by a partial scheduled redemption pursuant to a sinking fund or by a refunding redemption pursuant to which at the option of the issuer all or part of the issue can be retired from any available funds at prices which may or may not include a premium over the involuntary liquidation preference which generally is the same as the par or stated value of the convertible security in general optional redemption provisions are more likely to be exercised when the convertible security is valued at a premium over par or stated value than when they are valued at a discount from par or stated value generally the value of the convertible security will be at a premium over par when market interest rates fall below the coupon rate fixedincome securities the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities which invest in fixedincome securities fixedincome securities in many cases do not have the benefit of covenants which would prevent the issuer from engaging in capital restructurings or borrowing transactions in connection with corporate acquisitions leveraged buyouts or restructurings which could have the effect of reducing the ability of the issuer to meet its debt obligations and might result in the ratings of the securities and the value of the underlying trust portfolio being reduced page  fixedincome securities may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the time they were purchased were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market discount of previously issued securities will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline the market discount of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount securities will be reduced a discount security held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of capital gain and less in the form of interest income than a comparable security newly issued at current market rates market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the securities fixedincome securities may be original issue discount securities or zero coupon securities under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the securities is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income the current value of an original discount security reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity the market value tends to increase in greater increments as the securities approach maturity the effect of owning deep discount zero coupon securities which do not make current interest payments is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all earnings during the life of the discount obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligations at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason the zero coupon securities are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which make regular interest payments fixedincome securities may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium securities at the time they were purchased were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable securities decrease the market premium of previously issued securities will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market premium of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of securities trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable securities of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium security at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value to the extent that the securities were purchased at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital certain fixedincome securities may be subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to optional redemption provisions sinking fund provisions or otherwise a security subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a security issue is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new security issue a security subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par or from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue prior to maturity redemption pursuant to call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur when the securities have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value page  highyield securities the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities which invest in highyield securities an investment in highyield securities should be made with an understanding of the risks that an investment in highyield highrisk fixedrate domestic and foreign securities or junk bonds may entail including increased credit risks and the risk that the value of highyield securities will decline and may decline precipitously with increases in interest rates in recent years there have been wide fluctuations in interest rates and thus in the value of fixedrate securities generally highyield securities are under most circumstances subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and principal than are investments in loweryielding higherrated securities and their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of issuers of highyield highrisk securities resulting in a higher incidence of defaults among highyield highrisk securities a slowdown in the economy or a development adversely affecting an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at the prices respectively that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements for an issuer that has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated highyield high risk securities an increase in interest rates will increase that issuers interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating however many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt this reduces exposure to increasing rates but reduces the benefit to the issuer of declining rates the sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their consequences or therefore the course or extent of any similar market fluctuations in the future highyield securities or junk bonds the generic names for securities rated below bbb by standard  poors or below baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development by established companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions the market for highyield securities is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly financial institutions highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange trading of highyield securities therefore takes place primarily in overthecounter markets which consist of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms because the highyield security market is a dealer market rather than an auction market no single obtainable price for a given security prevails at any given time prices are determined by negotiation between traders the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made not all dealers maintain markets in all highyield securities therefore since there are fewer traders in these securities than there are in investment grade securities the bidoffer spread is usually greater for highyield securities than it is for investment grade securities lowerrated securities tend to offer higher yields than higherrated securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers of lowerrated securities may not be as strong as that of other issuers moreover if a fixedincome security is recharacterized as equity by the internal revenue service for federal income tax purposes the issuers interest deduction with respect to the security will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely affect the issuers credit rating because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with lowerrated securities the yields and prices of these securities tend to fluctuate more than higherrated securities with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their issuers in addition the market value of high yield highrisk fixedincome securities may fluctuate more than the market value of higherrated securities since highyield highrisk fixedincome securities tend to reflect shortterm credit development to a greater extent than higherrated securities lowerrated securities generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higherrated securities issuers of lowerrated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than issuers of higherrated securities and especially in the case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have recently been downgraded may be subject to claims by debtholders owners of property leased to the issuer or others which if sustained would make it more difficult for the issuers to meet their payment obligations highyield highrisk securities are also affected by variables such as interest rates inflation rates and real growth in the economy therefore investors should consider carefully the relative risks associated with investment in securities which carry lower ratings should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or interest the securities in the trust may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the defaulted security because amounts if any recovered by the page  securities in the trust in payment under the defaulted security may not be reflected in the value of the securities until actually received by the securities and depending upon when a unit holder purchases or sells his or her units it is possible that a unit holder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered highyield highrisk securities are generally subordinated obligations the payment of principal and premium if any interest and sinking fund requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the issuer senior obligations generally include most if not all significant debt obligations of an issuer whether existing at the time of issuance of subordinated debt or created thereafter upon any distribution of the assets of an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution total or partial liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any payment moreover generally no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior indebtedness thus in the event of insolvency holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more ratably than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer obligations that are rated lower than bbb by standard  poors or baa by moodys respectively should be considered speculative as such ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade investors should carefully review the objective of the trust and consider their ability to assume the risks involved before making an investment in the trust senior loans the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities which invest in senior loans issued by banks other financial institutions and other investors to corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts recapitalizations mergers acquisitions stock repurchases debt refinancings and to a lesser extent for general operating and other purposes an investment by securities in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans are typically structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on securities investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment senior loans are generally below investment grade quality and may be unrated at the time of investment are generally not registered with the sec or state securities commissions and are generally not listed on any securities exchange in addition the amount of public information available on senior loans is generally less extensive than that available for other types of assets subprime residential mortgage loans the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities which invest in subprime residential mortgage loans an investment in subprime residential mortgage loans should be made with an understanding of the risks which such an investment entails including increased credit risks and the risk that the value of subprime residential mortgage loans will decline and may decline precipitously with increases in interest rates in a high interest rate environment the value of subprime residential mortgage loans may be adversely affected when payments on the mortgages do not occur as anticipated resulting in the extension of the mortgages effective maturity and the related increase in interest rate sensitivity of a longerterm investment the value of subprime mortgage loans may also change due to shifts in the markets perception of issuers and regulatory or tax changes adversely affecting the mortgage securities markets as a whole due to current economic conditions including fluctuating interest rates and declining home values as well as aggressive lending practices subprime mortgage loans have in recent periods experienced increased rates of delinquency foreclosure bankruptcy and loss and they are likely to continue to experience rates that are higher and that may be substantially higher than those experienced by mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner thus because of the higher delinquency rates and losses associated with subprime mortgage loans risks of investing in securities which hold subprime mortgage loans are similar to those which affect highyield securities or junk bonds which include less liquidity greater volatility and an increased risk of default as compared to higher rated securities tips the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities which invest in tips tips are inflationindexed fixedincome securities issued by the us department of treasury that utilize an inflation mechanism tied to the consumer price index cpi tips are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states tips are offered with coupon page  interest rates lower than those of nominal rate treasury securities the coupon interest rate remains fixed throughout the term of the securities however each day the principal value of the tips is adjusted based upon a pro rata portion of the cpi as reported three months earlier future interest payments are made based upon the coupon interest rate and the adjusted principal value in a falling inflationary environment both interest payments and the value of the tips will decline foreign issuers the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities issued by or invest in securities issued by foreign entities since certain of the securities held by the trust consist of or invest in securities issued by foreign entities an investment in the trust involves certain investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust which invests solely in the securities of domestic entities these investment risks include future political or governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities the possibility that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen both of which would contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus in the value of the units the limited liquidity and relatively small market capitalization of the relevant securities market expropriation or confiscatory taxation economic uncertainties and foreign currency devaluations and fluctuations in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer also foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers the securities of many foreign issuers are less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition fixed brokerage commissions and other transaction costs on foreign securities exchanges are generally higher than in the united states and there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries than there is in the united states however due to the nature of the issuers of the securities selected for the trust the sponsor believes that adequate information will be available to allow the supervisor to provide portfolio surveillance for the trust securities issued by nonus issuers may pay interest andor dividends in foreign currencies and may be principally traded in foreign currencies therefore there is a risk that the us dollar value of these interest andor dividend payments andor securities will vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the basis of the best information available to the sponsor at the present time none of the securities in the trust are subject to exchange control restrictions under existing law which would materially interfere with payment to the trust of dividends due on or proceeds from the sale of the securities however there can be no assurance that exchange control regulations might not be adopted in the future which might adversely affect payment to the trust the adoption of exchange control regulations and other legal restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of international securities in the trust and on the ability of the trust to satisfy its obligation to redeem units tendered to the trustee for redemption in addition restrictions on the settlement of transactions on either the purchase or sale side or both could cause delays or increase the costs associated with the purchase and sale of the foreign securities and correspondingly could affect the price of the units investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all securities at the same time because of the unavailability of any security and restrictions applicable to the trust relating to the purchase of a security by reason of the federal securities laws or otherwise foreign securities generally have not been registered under the securities act of  and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such act sales of nonexempt securities by the trust in the united states securities markets are subject to severe restrictions and may not be practicable accordingly sales of these securities by the trust will generally be effected only in foreign securities markets although the sponsor does not believe that the trust will encounter obstacles in disposing of the securities investors should realize that the securities may be traded in foreign countries where the securities markets are not as developed or efficient and may not be as liquid as those in the united states the value of the securities will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent emerging markets the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities issued by or invest in securities from certain smaller and emerging markets compared to more mature markets some emerging markets may have a low level of regulation enforcement of regulations and monitoring of investors activities those activities may include practices such as trading on material nonpublic information the securities markets of developing countries are not as large as the more established securities markets and have substantially less trading volume resulting in a lack of liquidity and high page  price volatility there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries as well as a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries these factors may adversely affect the timing and pricing of the acquisition or disposal of securities in certain emerging markets registrars are not subject to effective government supervision nor are they always independent from issuers the possibility of fraud negligence undue influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists which along with other factors could result in the registration of a shareholding being completely lost investors should therefore be aware that the trust could suffer loss arising from these registration problems in addition the legal remedies in emerging markets are often more limited than the remedies available in the united states practices pertaining to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets in large part because of the need to use brokers and counterparties who are less well capitalized and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable as a result brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher in emerging markets and the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments delays in settlement could result in investment opportunities being missed if the trust is unable to acquire or dispose of a security certain foreign investments may also be less liquid and more volatile than us investments which may mean at times that such investments are unable to be sold at desirable prices political and economic structures in emerging markets often change rapidly which may cause instability in adverse social and political circumstances governments have been involved in policies of expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization intervention in the securities market and trade settlement and imposition of foreign investment restrictions and exchange controls and these could be repeated in the future in addition to withholding taxes on investment income some governments in emerging markets may impose different capital gains taxes on foreign investors foreign investments may also be subject to the risks of seizure by a foreign government and the imposition of restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency additionally some governments exercise substantial influence over the private economic sector and the political and social uncertainties that exist for many developing countries are considerable another risk common to most developing countries is that the economy is heavily export oriented and accordingly is dependent upon international trade the existence of overburdened infrastructures and obsolete financial systems also presents risks in certain countries as do environmental problems certain economies also depend to a large degree upon exports of primary commodities and therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices which in turn may be affected by a variety of factors small andor mid capitalization companies the following section applies to individual trusts which contain securities issued by or invest in securities that hold securities issued by small andor mid capitalization companies while historically stocks of small and mid capitalization companies have outperformed the stocks of large companies the former have customarily involved more investment risk as well such companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies some of these companies may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the prices of small and mid cap company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because such companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for the trusts which contain these securities to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices page
