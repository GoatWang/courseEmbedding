of the case trial court disposition disposition motion for rehearing filed mandate issued appellee  hon tomie t green hinds county circuit court julie ann epps robert farley wilkins office of the attorney general by ladonna c holland eleanor johnson peterson criminal  felony convicted of two counts of murder and sentenced to serve two concurrent terms of life imprisonment in the mississippi department of corrections affirmed before king cj roberts and carlton jj carlton j for the court ¶ seventeenyearold james r williams iii williams was indicted for the murder of his father and stepmother james r williams jr james jr and cynthia a williams cynthia respectively he was convicted by a hinds county circuit court jury on both counts and sentenced to serve two concurrent terms of life imprisonment williams appeals and raises seven issues i whether the trial court erred in denying williams’s motion to suppress ii whether the trial court erred in failing to require the prosecution to call officer dexter johnson and officer kevin ainsworth at the suppression hearing iii whether the trial court erred in prohibiting the defense from using extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement to impeach adam white iv whether the trial court erred in limiting the defendant’s crossexamination of adam white v whether the trial court erred in requiring the defense to conduct direct examination of adam white during the prosecution’s caseinchief vi whether the trial court erred in refusing a jury instruction on accessory after the fact vii whether williams is entitled to a new trial based on cumulative error ¶ we find no error and affirm facts ¶ on december   williams and adam white white helped james jr and cynthia move into a new home on january   james jr and cynthia were reported missing officers of the jackson police department went to their house at  winfield street to investigate there they found williams who told the officers that he had last seen james jr and cynthia on the evening of december   and did not know their whereabouts no foul play was suspected until january   when police returned to the house in furtherance of their investigation and found traces of blood ¶ the investigation focused on williams who was the last person known to have seen his father and stepmother on january   williams was taken to police headquarters for questioning at approximately  pm after waiving his miranda rights williams gave the first of two statements at approximately  pm in this statement williams simply restated that he had last seen james jr and cynthia on the evening of december   and did not know where they were prior to williams’s second statement white was brought in and questioned white identified  williams as the murderer and told police that he knew where the bodies were located white then set out with officers perry tate and kent daniels to recover the bodies which were discovered at approximately  am january   ¶ meanwhile williams’s mother and stepfather sandra mcfarland sandra and steven mcfarland steven collectively “the mcfarlands” arrived at police headquarters according to the mcfarlands they told police officers in williams’s presence not to question him further without an attorney the facts pertaining to this event are discussed more fully below the mcfarlands left police headquarters at approximately  am after being assured that williams would not be questioned further ¶ shortly thereafter officers tate and daniels who had recently returned from searching for the bodies approached williams and obtained from him a second waiver of rights and a confession williams’s confession represented that on the evening of december   james jr as an extreme disciplinary measure beat him and pulled a gun on him for missing work a couple of days earlier williams claimed that james jr then sat down on the couch and he williams retrieved a gun from his room returned to the living room and shot james jr williams stated that cynthia then walked into the room and started screaming at him whereupon williams shot and killed her also ¶ in april  williams was indicted for the murders of james jr and cynthia prior to trial williams filed a motion to suppress his confession claiming among other things that it was taken in violation of his fifth amendment rights the trial judge denied williams’s motion to suppress and the case proceeded to trial at trial williams and white offered drastically different versions of the events surrounding the killings  white was charged with accessory after the fact  white’s testimony ¶ white the prosecution’s star witness testified that williams killed james jr and cynthia then williams forced him with threats of violence to help cover up the crime by disposing of the bodies and cleaning the house specifically white stated that he and williams helped james jr and cynthia move until approximately  pm williams then dropped white off at white’s grandmother’s house to eat dinner williams returned at approximately  pm and told white “we’re going to go for a ride” according to white williams stepped out of the car with a  rifle in hand unloaded the gun handed it to white and told him to “chuck it” over the fence white complied at that point white figured that williams had killed his parents because according to white williams told him the day before that he was going to kill james jr and cynthia by putting rat poison in their milk ¶ williams then drove white to james jr and cynthia’s house opened the door and said “you’re about to help me do this” white claimed that he told williams that he wanted no part of it but williams threatened him by saying “either you can be with me or you can be with them” pointing to the lifeless bodies in fear for his life white helped williams load the bodies into the back of james jr’s truck williams drove the truck and ordered white to follow in williams’s car white followed williams to a wooded area in or around brandon mississippi and stopped as williams drove the truck off of the road and into a tree according to white the two then returned to james jr and cynthia’s house in williams’s car and cleaned the scene williams’s testimony ¶ williams testified that james jr accidentally shot cynthia and white shot james jr to this end williams claimed that when white arrived at james jr and cynthia’s house to lend a hand moving he brought a mm handgun along to show williams as james jr entered the living room white hid the gun under a love seat cushion later james jr discovered the gun when he sat on the  love seat and noticed a lump according to williams james jr then accused white of planning to rob him became irate and began waving the gun around when cynthia entered the living room james jr turned and the gun haphazardly discharged in cynthia’s direction fatally wounding her williams testified that white then retrieved a  rifle from williams’s room pointed it at james jr and ordered him to drop the mm as williams tried to calm james jr and coax the gun from his hand james jr hit him in the stomach and pushed him across the room williams claimed that james jr then turned toward white and started to draw the gun at which point white shot james jr who fell on the couch according to williams white shot james jr with the  rifle until it was empty picked up the mm and shot him three more times williams testified that he helped white dispose of the bodies and clean the scene under duress from white’s threats of death ¶ at the conclusion of trial the jury found williams guilty on both counts williams’s motion for a new trial was denied aggrieved williams now appeals to this court discussion i whether the trial court erred in denying williams’s motion to suppress ¶ to be admissible a confession “must have been intelligently knowingly and voluntarily given and not a product of police threats promises or inducements” wilson v state  so d   ¶ miss  citing manix v state  so d   ¶ miss  in determining the admissibility of a confession the trial court sits as the finder of fact and we will not disturb its decision unless manifestly wrong wilson  so d at  ¶ citing glasper v state  so d   ¶ miss  ¶ at the suppression hearing the mcfarlands testified that as they were leaving police headquarters they were in a room with williams officer bret baily and officer james cornelius steven claimed that officer kevin ainsworth was also present at this time the mcfarlands testified that they told the officers not to question williams without an attorney and sandra told  williams not to sign anything or speak to anyone until they got him an attorney steven recalled that williams responded by saying “thank you so much for coming and helping me here” according to williams he responded by saying “yes ma’am i understand” steven testified that williams never requested an attorney himself ¶ officer baily testified that the mcfarlands did not request an attorney in his presence officer cornelius stated that he never encountered the mcfarlands on the night in question both officers testified that williams himself never requested an attorney both officers also stated that officer ainsworth was not at the police station on the night in question ¶ williams testified that shortly after the mcfarlands left he was presented a waiver of rights williams claimed that at first he refused to sign the waiver and requested an attorney but he later signed the waiver and confessed after repeated attempts by the police to question him he claimed that he was threatened that he would receive a lethal injection if he did not give a statement ¶ at the conclusion of the suppression hearing the trial court determined that “in the totality of the circumstances and considering all of the testimony some having conflict the court is of the opinion that the statement was voluntarily given” the trial judge denied williams’s motion to suppress ¶ williams argues that his confession was taken in violation of his fifth amendment right to counsel which he claims was sufficiently invoked when the mcfarlands in his presence told police not to question him without an attorney edwards v arizona  us    minnick v mississippi  us    williams claims that his acquiescence in or rather his failure to issue a countermand to the mcfarlands’ remarks further supports his position the state argues that the trial judge did not err because williams himself did not request an attorney and a third party cannot invoke a criminal defendant’s personal right to an attorney mcgilberry v state  so d   ¶ miss   ¶ the fifth amendment right against selfincrimination requires that before custodial interrogation may take place a criminal defendant must be advised of his right to have an attorney present miranda v arizona  us    see reuben v state  so d   miss  once the right to counsel is invoked questioning must cease unless and until an attorney is present or the defendant himself reinitiates further discussions with police edwards  us at  jacobs v state  so d   ¶ miss  where police initiate further communication with the defendant any statement given is “presumed involuntary and therefore inadmissible as substantive evidence at trial even where the suspect executes a waiver and his statements would be considered voluntary under traditional standards” mcneil v wisconsin  us    ¶ in the instant case it is undisputed that police reinitiated discussions with williams after the alleged invocation of his right to counsel thus this issue turns on whether williams’s right to counsel was invoked if so his confession was illegal under edwards ¶ as the state argues a defendant’s right to counsel is not invoked by a third party’s acting outside the presence and knowledge of the defendant see moran v burbine  us    mcgilberry  so d at  ¶ “the right to counsel must be invoked by the defendant and not by third parties acting outside the knowledge of the defendant” williams contends that the “no third party rule” does not apply to his situation because the mcfarlands made a request for counsel in his presence however in light of our supreme court’s decision in lee v state  so d   miss  we find this distinction of no consequence to the outcome of this case ¶ in lee the defendant’s sister made a statement to police regarding counsel in the defendant’s presence during the course of his arrest lee  so d at  the defendant later waived his miranda rights and gave an inculpatory statement without further indication that he wished to speak with police only in the presence of counsel id in affirming the trial court’s  decision not to suppress the confession our supreme court rejected the defendant’s contention that the right to counsel may be invoked by a thirdparty attempt made in the defendant’s presence id the court in lee stated as follows a rule allowing third parties to invoke individual constitutional rights is not required by federal case law nor mississippi case law in our opinion such a rule would be contrary to the clear implication of both federal and state cases see eg miranda v arizona  us    l ed d   s ct   if the individual states that he wants an attorney the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present id ¶ under lee for an assertion of the right to counsel to be effective it must emanate from the suspect not from a third party accordingly we find that williams’s right to counsel was not invoked by the mcfarlands’ requests for counsel notwithstanding that such a request was made in his presence we now focus our inquiry to determine whether the right to counsel was invoked when williams in response to the mcfarlands’ requests for counsel remarked “thank you so much for coming and helping me here” andor “yes ma’am i understand” ¶ in order to invoke the right to counsel and thereby the protections of edwards “the suspect must unambiguously request counsel” davis v united states  us    finding defendant’s statement “maybe i should talk to a lawyer” ambiguous and insufficient to invoke the right to counsel under davis the relevant inquiry is “‘whether the accused actually invoked his right to counsel’” davis  us at  quoting smith v illinois  us    discussing the level of clarity required the court in davis instructed that the suspect “must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney” id at  ¶ in the instant case we find that williams did not sufficiently invoke his right to counsel using the defendant’s statement in davis as a reference of measure we conclude that williams’s  remarks do not amount to an unambiguous request for counsel aside from williams’s claim to the contrary the weight of the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing established that at no point did williams make reference to an attorney or clearly articulate a desire for an attorney’s assistance where as here a statement is admitted on conflicting evidence the trial court’s decision will generally be affirmed on appeal sanders v state  so d   ¶ miss  citing dancer v state  so d   ¶ miss  ¶ as neither the mcfarlands’ requests for counsel nor williams’s conduct were sufficient to invoke his fifth amendment right to counsel we find no error in the trial judge’s denial of williams’s motion to suppress the confession this issue is without merit ii whether the trial court erred in failing to require the prosecution to call officer dexter johnson and officer kevin ainsworth at the suppression hearing ¶ williams claims that the trial court committed a violation of agee v state  so d   miss  by failing to require the state to offer the testimony of officer johnson and officer ainsworth at the suppression hearing we disagree ¶ when a defendant claims that a confession was obtained through coercion the trial court must conduct a hearing outside the jury’s presence to determine the confession’s admissibility wilson v state  so d   ¶ miss  citing thorson v state  so d   miss  the court in agee stated that when after the state has made out a prima facie case as to the voluntariness of the confession the accused offers testimony that violence threats of violence or offers of reward induced the confession then the state must offer all the officers who were present when the accused was questioned and when the confession was signed or give an adequate reason for the absence of any such witness  so d at  citing lee v state  miss    so d   miss  ¶ williams would have this court hold that agee requires the state to offer the testimony of every officer the parties recall being present at the police station at the time his statement was given  however we do not find the agee rule to require as much under agee “only those officers claimed to have induced a confession by some means of coercion are required to testify at the hearing” wilson  so d at  ¶ citing abram v state  so d   miss  see also brink v state  so d   ¶ miss ct app  agee only requires the state to offer testimony of “persons who are claimed to have induced the confession through some means of coercion” ¶ we find that the trial court’s failure to require the state to offer the testimony of officers johnson and ainsworth at the suppression hearing did not amount to an agee violation williams’s allegations of coercion were directed toward officers baily tate and daniels williams did not assert that officer johnson or officer ainsworth threatened or coerced him nor does the record indicate that either officer was present when the coercive tactics were alleged to have occurred likewise it was neither alleged nor does the record reflect that either officer was present when williams signed the second waiver and gave the confession accordingly we find the trial court did not err in ruling that the state was not required to offer either the testimony of officer johnson or officer ainsworth this issue is without merit iii whether the trial court erred in prohibiting the defense from using extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement to impeach adam white ¶ we review the admission or exclusion of evidence under the abuse of discretion standard of review hodgin v state  so d   ¶ miss  citation omitted pursuant to mississippi rule of evidence  a decision to admit or exclude evidence is not error “unless a substantial right of the party is affected” ¶ several days before trial counsel for williams interviewed white and transcribed the conversation during white’s crossexamination the following exchange took place regarding a  conversation between white and officer davis that occurred while white was leading police to the bodies q what did detective davis say to you while you were riding around a he didn’t really say anything i was asking him questions about what were the possibilities what could happen with all this he was explaining the different levels of the charge and he said the best thing i could do for myself is to give as much information as i can without lying and tell the truth q did he tell you if you cooperate you’d get leniency a no q he didn’t say that to you a no sir ¶ at this point counsel for williams sought to impeach white’s testimony with the following portion of the transcript of the interview conducted a few days earlier q did detective davis say if you cooperated that there was more of a likelihood that you would receive a lesser charge a he said that if i cooperated that it would help me he didn’t say how it would help me he said that it would help me this was after i had started cooperating the trial court ruled that defense counsel could ask white about the statement but the court denied counsel’s request to use the transcript ¶ as argued by the state before extrinsic evidence may be used to impeach a witness under mississippi rule of evidence b “there must be an actual contradiction in fact between the testimony and the prior statement” everett v state  so d   ¶ miss ct app  citing ratcliff v state  so d   ¶ miss ct app  a prior statement is inconsistent if “under any rational theory its introduction might lead to a conclusion different from the witness’s testimony” or the statement “has a reasonable tendency to discredit the witness’s testimony” everett  so d at  ¶ citing ratcliff  so d at  ¶  ¶ in the instant case williams fails to demonstrate how white’s prior statement is inconsistent with his trial testimony the transcript of the interview was sought to impeach white’s trial testimony that he was not promised leniency however white did not represent that he was promised leniency in either statement white’s prior statement while not identical to his trial testimony cannot be said to possess a reasonable tendency to discredit his testimony therefore we find that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in prohibiting defense counsel from using the transcript of the interview this issue is without merit iv whether the trial court erred in limiting the defendant’s crossexamination of adam white ¶ under this issue williams assigns as error the trial judge’s refusal to allow his attorney to  crossexamine white using his juvenile court records  introduce cynthia’s bank statement and pictures of white at an atm and  have white and williams stand next to each other in order to show that white was larger ¶ we review the exclusion of evidence under the abuse of discretion standard of review hobgood v state  so d   ¶ miss  citing clark v state  so d   ¶ miss  ¶ a criminal defendant is entitled to conduct “broad and extensive crossexamination of the witnesses against him and especially is this so with respect to the principal prosecution witness” suan v state  so d   miss  citations omitted however this right is not absolute rather the scope of crossexamination “is within the sound discretion of the trial court and the trial court possesses inherent power to limit crossexamination to relevant matters” smith v state  so d   ¶ miss  citing pace v state  so d   miss   white’s youth court record  ¶ at trial williams’s counsel sought to crossexamine white using his youth court record  to impeach white’s trial testimony that he stood  ’ and weighed  pounds at the time of the murders  to show that white had been institutionalized in the state mental hospital at whitfield twice for physical violence once in  and again in  and  to show that white had been diagnosed with several mental illnesses including intermittent explosive disorder the trial judge refused to allow counsel for williams to crossexamine white with his youth court record for the purposes offered ¶ in the instant case we find that white’s youth court record was not admissible for the purposes for which it was offered one accused of a crime has the right to crossexamine a witness against him to show bias or interest in testifying bass v state  so d   miss  citing davis v alaska  us    a juvenile court adjudication may in the trial judge’s discretion be used to crossexamine a witness other than a criminal defendant to show bias or interest see bass  so d at  ramsey v state  so d   ¶ miss ct app  however juvenile adjudications cannot be used for general impeachment purposes see brown v state  so d   ¶ miss ct app  citing bass  so d at  ¶ we find that white’s juvenile court record was offered for general impeachment purposes not to show bias or interest in testifying evidence of white’s height and weight as represented in his juvenile record was offered to impeach white’s trial testimony that he was   tall and weighed  pounds at the time of the murders likewise evidence that white had twice been institutionalized for physical violence was not offered to show bias or interest in testifying instead it was offered to establish that white had been violent on prior occasions regarding evidence that  further white’s prior instances of violence are inadmissible under mississippi rule of evidence b which prohibits extrinsic evidence of specific instances of conduct not probative  white had been diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder this evidence was offered to establish that white has a propensity for violence ¶ we find no indication in the record that white’s juvenile court records were offered to show bias or interest therefore we find that the trial judge acted within her discretion in ruling that white could not be crossexamined by his juvenile court record this issue is without merit  cynthia’s bank statement and pictures of white at an atm ¶ during crossexamination white admitted that after the killings he used cynthia’s atm card to make several withdrawals from her account white testified that he made several withdrawals with williams and he made several after williams was incarcerated white could not recall the exact amount withdrawn or the exact number of withdrawals he made when asked if the amount withdrawn could have been  white stated “sounds – – it’s a pretty good number” counsel for williams then proffered cynthia’s bank statements as well as photographs depicting white withdrawing money from cynthia’s bank the trial judge denied the proffer finding the exhibits irrelevant because white admitted withdrawing money and the bank statements did not show who withdrew money from cynthia’s account the trial judge held that the exact amount withdrawn was irrelevant ¶ evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence” mre  “evidence which is not relevant is not admissible” mre  white admitted that he used cynthia’s atm card on several occasions to withdraw money while white’s of veracity from being used to attack the credibility of a witness  we find this evidence also inadmissible under mississippi rule of evidence a as the evidence was offered to show that white was a violent person and therefore create an inference that he acted in conformity with his propensity for violence on the night in question  use of cynthia’s card does possess a tendency to establish a motive or intent for his involvement in the killings the exact number of withdrawals andor the exact amount of money actually withdrawn by white is not a fact of consequence to the determination of the case even if determined relevant this evidence would properly be excluded under mississippi rule of evidence  as “its probative value is substantially outweighed by    considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence” ¶ accordingly we find the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in excluding the bank statements and photographs this issue is without merit  incourt size comparison ¶ as stated above williams’s theory of the case was that he did not shoot james jr or cynthia and he was forced to help white destroy the evidence because white threatened to kill him if he did not to support this position the defense also stressed that white was much larger in stature than williams at the time of trial williams testified that he stood   and weighed  pounds white testified that he stood   tall and weighed  pounds during white’s crossexamination counsel for williams asked the court if white could stand next to williams for a size comparison the trial judge refused the request ¶ given our standard of review we find that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in refusing to allow an incourt size comparison at the time of the murders williams and white were both adolescents age seventeen and fifteen respectively the trial was held over two years later thus williams’s and white’s sizes at the time of trial can hardly be considered probative of their respective sizes at the time of the murders in fact white testified that he had grown four inches and gained some forty pounds since the murders moreover williams testified that white threatened him at gunpoint in such a situation a size difference is virtually a nonfactor this issue is without merit  v whether the trial court erred in requiring the defense to conduct direct examination of adam white during the prosecution’s caseinchief ¶ on the fourth day of trial the state called white as its final witness during cross examination counsel for williams asked whether white was under subpoena because the defense intended to call white to testify as part of its caseinchief the trial judge ruled that any direct examination of white must be conducted at the conclusion of the state’s caseinchief because “when he leaves the stand for all practical purposes he’s going to be released by this court” after the state’s redirect examination of white the trial judge asked counsel for williams if he wished to conduct any direct examination he declined the invitation ¶ williams argues that the trial judge’s ruling violated his sixth amendment right to compulsory process morris v state  so d   ¶ miss  the state asserts that the trial judge acted within her discretion in controlling the mode and order of the presentation of evidence under mississippi rule of evidence a ¶ we find that williams’s sixth amendment right to compulsory process was not violated white was present and testified at trial williams’s attorney thoroughly crossexamined white and he had the opportunity to conduct direct examination if he so desired ¶ as the state contends the essence of this issue involves the trial court’s right to control the presentation of evidence under mississippi rule of evidence a which provides control by court the court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to  make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth  avoid needless consumption of time and  protect the witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment under rule a “it is within the trial courts discretion to decide whether to allow a witness to be recalled to the stand” ellis v state  so d   miss  finding no abuse of  discretion in the trial court’s decision to allow the prosecution to recall a witness in order to admit cocaine into evidence ¶ in the instant case we find no error in the trial court’s decision not to allow white to be recalled as previously noted white was called to testify on the fourth day of trial as the state’s final witness clearly the trial judge’s decision was made in the interest of efficiency as contemplated by rule a we cannot say that the trial judge abused her discretion in so ruling this issue is without merit vi whether the trial court erred in refusing a jury instruction on accessory after the fact ¶ williams requested a jury instruction on accessory after the fact the trial judge denied the instruction noting that williams was not indicted for accessory after the fact and that it was not a lesserincluded offense to murder williams argues that the trial judge erred in refusing the instruction he claims that his testimony provided an evidentiary basis to support the instruction ¶ a defendant is entitled to have his or her theory of the case presented to the jury white v state  so d   ¶ miss  a lesserincluded offense instruction should be given only where the evidence supports the instruction reynolds v state  so d   miss  a lesserrelated offense instruction should be granted unless the trial judge can say taking the evidence in the light most favorably to the accused that no reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty of the lesserrelated offense ellis v state  so d   ¶ miss  citing giles v state  so d   miss  see also monroe v state  so d   miss  a lesserincluded instruction should be given where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury “could find the defendant not guilty of the principal offense charged in the indictment yet guilty of the lesserincluded offense” citations omitted  ¶ one is an accessory after the fact when he or she has “concealed received or relieved any felon or having aided or assisted any felon knowing that such person had committed a felony with intent to enable such felon to escape or to avoid arrest trial conviction or punishment after the commission of such felony    ” miss code ann §  rev  ¶ in the instant case we find that the evidence was such that no reasonable jury could find williams not guilty of murder yet guilty of accessory after the fact williams’s confession and white’s testimony overwhelmingly refute any suggestion that williams acted only as an accessory after the fact in his confession williams admitted that he killed james jr and cynthia thus by his own admission corroborated by white’s testimony williams was a principal to the crime of murder therefore he could not at the same time be an accessory after the fact see eg byrom v state  so d   ¶¶ miss  mangum v state  so d   ¶ miss  hoops v state  so d   miss  buckley v state  so d   miss  ¶ furthermore the only evidence in the record which supports an instruction on accessory after the fact was the testimony of williams himself however williams’s own testimony contradicts his assertion that he was entitled to an instruction on accessory after the fact while williams admitted helping white dispose of the bodies and clean the scene he maintained throughout his testimony that he did so under duress because white threatened to kill him at gunpoint if he did not therefore according to williams he was not guilty of anything ¶ we find no evidence in the record to support williams’s request for an instruction on accessory after the fact this issue is without merit vii whether williams is entitled to a new trial based on cumulative error ¶ we have found no error in williams’s individual assignments of error consequently there can be no cumulative error this issue is without merit  ¶ the judgment of the circuit court for the first judicial district of hinds
