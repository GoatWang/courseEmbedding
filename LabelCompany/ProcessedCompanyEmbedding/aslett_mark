turn the call over to mercurys president and ceo mark aslett mark aslett thanks gerry good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us i’ll begin today’s call with a business update gerry will review the financials and guidance and then well open it up to your questions mercury delivered strong bookings record revenues and record adjusted ebitda in the third quarter of fy ’ our organic and acquired businesses including ces all posted strong results we came in at the high end of our q guidance on all of our metrics and we’ve raised our guidance for the full fiscal year mercury’ total revenues grew  from q of fy ‘ to a record  million we continued to deliver strong growth organically excluding the ces business acquired in q revenues was up nearly  from q last year adjusted ebitda on a consolidated  consolidated basis was up  yearoveryear ended more than  of revenue one percentage point inside our recently updated target financial model our largest revenue programs in the quarter was sewip patriot a large groundbased radar filthy buzzard golden staff and aegis our largest bookings programs in q was sewip f sata triton aegis and f in addition during q we received a five year sole source  million basic ordering agreement from the navy for filthy buzzard this is really important win for us giving us great visibility on a major ew program for an extended period of time we also booked a second full rate production order for sewip block  value to close to  million the first full rate production order came in just two quarters ago so receiving the second order within a year is very beneficial international defense bookings for q including foreign military sales were up more than  times versus a ago up total backlog exiting q was strong up  yearoveryear and our  month forward revenue coverage remains excellent there were three corporate highlights since our last call our headquarters relocation from chelmsford to andover massachusetts our highly successful equity offering and the acquisition of delta microwave the headquarters move was successfully completed in early march as planned im very pleased with how the new facility turned out and our employees seem to feel the same way we’re also happy with the fact that we executed such a large and complex move with zero loss of productivity the equity offering in january couldnt have gone any better as a result mercury is well positioned with a strong balance sheet and the capacity to continue pursuing our markets and content expansion growth strategy we continue to execute against this strategy by acquiring delta microwave just after quarter end we expect delta to be a great addition for mercury given its talented team product portfolio and customer relationships as well as the potential it brings with backlog driven growth manufacturing cost synergies and tax benefits delta microwave is a strong position on the number of franchise us and international defense programs such as f paveway mald role ph river joint that complement for mercurys presence the deal brings us new capabilities related to highpower highfrequency active and passive rf components and subassemblies and in particular gan solidstate power amplifiers these new capabilities have scale and breadth to our core rf business while expanding our addressable market delta has strong relationships with space oems supplying future manned spaceflight missions as well as military and commercial satellite programs these are new growth opportunities for mercury and they also strengthen our core radar ew and precision guided munitions market presence delta has an outstanding leadership team that will remain with mercury we expect the business deliver higher adjusted ebitda driven by substantial revenue growth as well as cost synergies in our fiscal year’s ‘ and ‘ in addition to targeting manufacturing synergies we plan to invest in greater levels of internal rd as well as manufacturing and test automation at deltas oxnard california plant a worldclass facility with capabilities similar to those of our hudson new hampshire amc these capabilities are more and more important as our customers the major primes accelerate what we’re calling best flight ph to quality the primes have experienced a number of issues with competing suppliers that are having difficulties right now and we’re picking up a significant share of this business our customers are seeking to do business with a small number of highquality scalable suppliers who can deliver affordability and innovation in essence the primes are looking for outsourcing partners that have the capacity to coinvest white internally funded rd and we’re doing exactly that in addition over the past few years weve made significant investments in our manufacturing assets we focus the majority of these investments on improving scalability affordability and quality as highlighted this quarter we continue to build out of our trusted manufacturing facility in phoenix which we expect to be an important competitive advantage for us in the secure processing domain the facility achieved renewal of its dmea trusted manufacturing certification while also adding a dmea design certification q also marked a successful completion of the erp system conversion in phoenix this was the largest and most complex such conversion weve ever done contribute to an amazing job by the mercury team overall we’re on track to deliver the synergies that we anticipated from the microsemi carveout transaction and to complete the integration activities on time and on budget the ces integration is also on track now operating as mercury’s mission systems international or mmsi ces delivered a strong third quarter financially in terms of revenue profitability and new design wins we continue to feel really good about the business which brings us a magnificent team and worldclass technologies in the safety processing arena as we anticipated we’re seeing great opportunities for that capabilities inside our customer base and mmsi on that first aid ph program is part of mercury in q turning now to new business the level of new business pursuits and design activity remains the highest since joining mercury our corporate strategy the acquisitions that we’ve done and the capabilities in go to market model we developed are playing out extremely well the way we positioned ourselves in secure sensor mission processing the commercial business model that we operate and our trusted manufacturing assets are all reflected in our healthy design win pipeline looking to our q design win specifically we made further progress on two large secure airborne processing opportunities we continue to win new designs and penetrate in the missiles and munitions space and mmsi one of major new mission computed design for a platform along with these design wins we are pursuing multiple opportunities in tactical ew and secure processing both in the embedded domain as well as for the new secure rack server that we formally launched this quarter the secure rack server is an exciting product line for us to comply with government program protection requirements the primes are beginning to personalize ph purchase specialized security capabilities from trusted domestic suppliers mercury among them our is the only rack server that we know of which includes not only advanced security capabilities but also ruggedization and a fully trusted supply chain for both hardware and software we directly target some of the market expansion opportunities we talked about in our investor day specifically moving beyond the sensor into other mission critical computer applications such as commandandcontrol as well as combat systems i’ve also mentioned that in the third quarter mercury began shipping the largest computing subsystem that weve ever built it includes more than  racks sophisticated high performance computing capabilities for a large groundbased radar all in all an impressive effort by the team given the speed at which we’ve been able to design develop and deliver the first shipments to our customer mercury strongly positioned from an opportunity perspective as we begin the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘ the strategic deals that we completed since fy ‘ has substantially expanded our capability sets as well as our total addressable market it also enable us to provide a board range of affordable preintegrated secure processing subsystems at the same time we successfully leveraged internal rd investments as well as acquisitions to build a bestinclass portfolio of products and capabilities as a result were involved in franchise programs that appear to be well funded and are currently in or moving into production while also winning important new designs we’re continuing to grow and diversify our program base while expanding our content our broader program portfolio also means low risk and additional opportunities for growth going forward we intend to remain active and disciplined in our approach to ma as we work to extend our record of organic and acquisition driven growth above the industry average we will continue to look for deals that are strategically aligned have the potential to be accretive in the shortterm and drive longterm shareholder value as we do so well continue to target acquisitions that expand our addressable market in aerospace and defense electronics and the scale of technology platform that weve built we remain focused on the key pillars of the business rf and secure processing while also continuing to assemble critical and differentiated solutions to secure sensor and mission processing we’ll continue to acquire smaller capability lead tuckins while building a pipeline of larger opportunities moving to the industry conditions weve begun fy ‘ with another budget continuing resolution which remains in place environment in washington that being said given our strong backlog and the high level of activity we’re sitting in our business we remain confident in our outlook our current highlevel activity stems from a couple of trends the first is the primes outsourcing more and as like to quality that i mentioned earlier we designed our business model and strategy with these in mind and is clearly paying off the second trend is what appears to be an active focus by the government in the primes to delay their supply chains the means of gaining access to innovative and commercial suppliers while making their solutions more affordable we view this is a positive given that over time mercury is moved up the value chain from a tier  to the midtier  level our recent acquisitions have made us more capable of providing affordable subsystem solutions this in turn has allowed us to disintermediate less capable product oriented competitors we’re seeing the results in our bookings revenue and the strength of our design win pipeline despite the continue budget challenges we believe mercury remains on track to meet our financial goals for fiscal  and beyond this means continued to deliver above industry average growth in revenue and profitability we’re anticipating continued strong performance in the fourth quarter both organically and in our acquired businesses driven by growth in our chosen end markets major product lines and across many of our programs in light of mercurys strong results through the first three quarters of fy ’ the continued success of our integration activities and our strong backlog we are again raising our fullyear guidance gerry will take you through the outlook in more detail with that i’d like to turn the call over to gerry gerry gerry haines thank you mark and good afternoon again everyone before i go through the financial results ill note that unless otherwise stated we’ll be discussing the companys financial results comparisons to prior periods and guidance on a consolidated basis the historical results include the ces business we acquired in q of this fiscal year but exclude delta microwave which we acquired early in q this is another busy and very successful quarter for mercury in addition to once again delivering strong financial results we relocated our headquarters completed a very successful capital raise and also finalized negotiations for the delta microwave acquisition to put a portion of that newly raise capital to work turning to our financials mercurys revenue for the third quarter of fiscal ‘ exceeded the  million mark for the first time in the companys history even before taking into account the contribution of ces total revenue increased  million to  million up  from q last year and just above the highend of our guidance of  million to  million excluding the impact of ces revenues would have been  million an increase of  million or  yearoveryear which itself would have been a record international revenue including foreign military sales was  of total revenue compared with  in q of last year revenue from radar and electronic warfare together accounted for  of consolidated total revenue compared with  a year ago once again this quarter the lower proportion versus q last year reflects the larger and more diverse revenue mix for the quarter resulting from the addition of several new businesses and the associated expansion of our addressable market and revenue base q radar revenue was down  yearoveryear while electronic warfare revenue more than doubled bookings for the third quarter kept pace with a record revenue totalling  million up  from  million in q last year and yielding a solid booktobill ratio of  international and foreign military sales bookings represented  of total bookings compared to  in q of last fiscal year we ended the third quarter with a strong total backlog of  million compared with  million a year ago approximately  million or  of this total backlog is expected to ship within the next  months mercury continues to translate this bookings and revenue growth into very solid profitability our gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal ‘ was  at the top end of our q guidance and around the midpoint of our target business model gross margin was down one point from the prior quarter reflecting changes in our q sales mix q fiscal ‘ gross margin also included a negative impact of approximately  million from the step up ces inventory valuations due to purchase accounting this phenomenon will also occur in next quarter when we include our latest acquisition delta microwave in our results total q operating expenses were  million versus our guidance of  million to  million and  million for the same period last year the yearoveryear change was primarily due to the incremental addition of the microsemi and ces acquisitions q operating expenses also reflect the companys ongoing investments to realize planned manufacturing efficiencies as well as increased rd investment in our newly acquired businesses as we boost spending to align with our organic level of rd investment opex in the third quarter also included approximately  million of noncash rent expense attributable to the lease of our new headquarters driven by gaap lease accounting this duplicative noncash expense will end in may of this year when cash rent payments for our new facility commence and the lease for our prior headquarters site expires gaap net income for the third quarter of fiscal ‘ was  million or  per share this compares with  million or  per share in q last year adjusted eps for the third quarter increased to  per share up  from  a share in q of fiscal ‘ this is within our guidance range of  to  per share even after the impact of the share increase resulting from our q equity offering which was not included in our guidance excluding the impact of those additional shares adjusted eps would have been  a share exceeding our guidance the actual eps numbers are based on approximately  million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter in terms of adjusted ebitda mercury continued to achieve strong growth combined with improved profitability driven by the synergies were realizing from the investments in our business integration programs mercurys q fiscal ‘ adjusted ebitda increased  to a record  million up from  million a year ago this exceeded our q guidance from  million to  million and at over  of revenue is more than four point ph into our longterm target range of  to  turning to the balance sheet mercury ended the third quarter fiscal ‘ with cash and cash equivalents of  million compared with  million a year earlier as i mentioned earlier we have since put a little more than  million of this to work through our acquisition of delta microwave from cash flow perspective mercurys operating cash flow of  million for q of fiscal ‘ was partially offset by  million of capital expenditures this yielded  million of free cash flow compared with  million in q of fiscal  as anticipated our free cash flow was nearly doubled to  million we reported for the sequential second quarter of fiscal ‘ our forecast was for free cash flow to be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half reflecting a decline in capital expenditures coupled with strong operating cash flow our current capital expansion projects have now started tapering off and were beginning to see the benefits associated with more highly integrated and capable business our microsemi carveout integration plan remains on track and we anticipate realizing the estimated  million of originally projected run rate cost synergies well within the timeframe laid out in our initial plans as we indicated when the transaction was first announced we expect approximately two thirds of those run rate cost synergies to be realized within the first two years net capital expenditures for this quarter was somewhat lower than anticipated due to slight shifts in the timing of certain spending this reflects only the timing of expenditures and the projects remain on time and on plan notwithstanding the timing shifts we still expect q capital expenditures to be substantially lower than in q at roughly  million  million for the quarter echoing marks comments our equity offering in january was met by extremely strong demand and completed on favourable terms net proceeds from the offering were  million of which we used  million for the acquisition of delta microwave which was completed on april rd just after the close of q this use of cash is consistent with our strategy to take advantage of smaller tuckin deals even as we continue to build out a pipeline of additional opportunities of various sizes as mark said delta microwave is a terrific business in terms of the capabilities market expansion growth and profitability it brings to mercury delta’s backlog in our q totalled more than  million which puts the business on a trajectory for substantial growth on a yearoveryear basis at the same time the deal creates opportunities for significant cost synergies in addition to the estimated  million net present value of the tax benefits associated with the transaction structure these cost synergies are currently expected to total approximately  million nearly half of this amount should be realized in fiscal  with  of it expected to be realized by the end of year two and  million of remaining capacity on our universal shelf registration as a result we are wellpositioned to continue executing on our capital deployment strategy supporting future growth both organically and through acquisitions ill turn now to our financial guidance for the full fiscal year and fourth quarter of  for purposes of modeling and guidance weve assumed no restructuring and no acquisition or additional financing related expenses and an effective tax rate of  in the periods discussed the guidance also assumes weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately  million shares for fiscal q and  million shares for the full fiscal year in light of our strong yeartodate results our robust bookings and backlog our pipeline of opportunities and our acquisition integration efforts we are once again raising our revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance for the full fiscal year  we also expect strong positive operating cash flow for the balance of the fiscal year as we predicted earlier capex reached its peak in q although at a level somewhat lower than originally anticipated we continue to expect our capex to taper off to more normalized levels over the next few quarters reflecting the completion of the recent move into our new headquarters and the acceleration of our microsemi and ces integration efforts highlighted by the progress this past quarter and expanding the capabilities of our dmea certified facility in phoenix arizona the microsemi and ces integration plans including the planned savings remain solidly on track with that as background before the acquisition of delta microwave we now expect our base revenue for the full year fiscal ‘ to increase to between  million and  million up from our prior guidance of  million to  million including the contribution of delta microwave we now expect mercurys total revenue for fiscal ‘ to be in the range of  million to  million total gaap net income for fiscal ’ including delta microwave is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per share we currently expect total adjusted ebitda for fiscal ‘ to be approximately  million to  million an increase of  to  from fiscal ‘ and at approximately  to  of revenue for the year well within the range established by our current target business model adjusted eps for fiscal ‘ is now expected to be approximately  to  per share turning now to q and doing the math based on our actual results for the first three quarters of the year for the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘ forecasting total revenue including delta microwave to be in the range of  million to  million gross margin for q is expected to be in the range of  to  reflecting the negative impact to purchase accounting inventory valuation step ups and modest changes in our q sales mix q gaap net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per share adjusted eps for q is expected to be in the range of  to  per share this estimate assumes approximately  million of amortization of intangible assets  million of fair value adjustments from purchase accounting  million of stockbased compensation expense and as previously stated  million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of  million to  million representing approximately  to  of revenue at the forecasted revenue range this includes  million of noncash rent expense attributable again to the lease of our new headquarters as well as modestly increased operating expenses associated with our integration and rd spending plans in summary we anticipate that fiscal ‘ will be yet another year when the second half is stronger than the first half our content and market expansion growth strategies have positioned us well despite the uncertain defense budget environment our bookings in order flow are strong we have substantial new business opportunities in the pipeline we’re harvesting the acquisition integration synergies that we anticipated consistent with our original plans in terms of both dollars and time were expanding mercurys addressable market and driving profitable growth through disciplined ma reflecting these positive dynamics we believe that mercury is on track for strong growth and solid financial performance in fiscal ‘ with that well be happy to take your questions operator you can proceed with the qa now questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and the first question comes from the line of jason gursky from citi your line is open jason gursky great thank you good afternoon guys just a quick mark aslett hi jason jason gursky housekeeping question if i might you mentioned organic growth a few times throughout the discussion and through  and gives a few numbers but i didn’t quite catch what you guys believe the underlying organic growth number was for this quarter gerry haines so we said that the organic revenue total for the year was expected to be  to  which is a lift from our prior organic guidance which did not include delta of course jason gursky okay great and then just to know more further detail on the specific quarter gerry haines we didn’t give more detail to break it out for the quarter no jason gursky okay that’s fine just wanted to make sure i didn’t miss anything and then perhaps just stepping back and thinking about some of the recent wins here the opportunity set this year in front of us as well as the more recent acquisitions can you just maybe provide us a quick update here on the glide path to your margin targets and whether the timing on that remains intact or that you can pull it forward given the recent wins and the opportunity sets in the acquisitions just kind of a general updates on the things that have gone on since you set those targets and whether that is moving things around to be honest mark aslett are you talking the adjusted ebitda model that we have jason jason gursky yes that’s exactly mark aslett yes so if you think we’re  months into the acquisition of the microsemi caveout and when we did that deal we took the opportunity arising target model to the  to  range at the time when we announced the deal we thought that we would be able to get into the target model low end of that range in the current fiscal year and i think as a result of the increased growth that we’re delivering in the business both on organic basis as well as the acquired business as well as the success of our integration efforts we think that we’ll be well inside of that range on a yeartodate – sort of by the end of this fiscal year so we’re actually slightly ahead of where we thought we were going to be when we did the deal a year ago jason gursky okay and do you think that that will sustain itself over the next  to  quarters there is nothing unique about the recent wins the opportunity set in front of you that would change your ability to kind of be solidly in that range from the point that you achieve it mark aslett no i think we’re in – i think we’re in a good spot so we’ll continue to recognize the synergies for the work that we’re doing obviously anyhow in this quarter as well as next fiscal year as gerry said in his prepared remarks so you know the target that we gave about  to  is obviously a multiyear journey like we done in the past and you know we actually feel really good about the progress that were making jason gursky okay good thanks guys mark aslett all right gerry haines sure operator thank you our next question is from the line of seth seifman of jpmorgan your line is open unidentified analyst hey good afternoon this is benon sign on for seth mark aslett hi ben unidentified analyst i was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about you know maybe the risk of the current budget situation and you know what kind of might happen to your outlook under an extended continuing resolution if we don’t get a budget by friday and maybe what happens under like a full year continuing resolution mark aslett yes we – given the backlog that we have and the programs that we’re on we kind of looked it through the lens of a continuing resolution and we actually feel pretty good about you know where we’re positioned right now you know hence also raising our guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year so we feel good ben unidentified analyst and might there be any risk to like fy ’ mark aslett not that we see right now but obviously we’re in the midst of our planning and we’ll have more to talk about it at our fiscal year ‘ guidance on our next earnings call unidentified analyst okay thanks operator thank you our next question is from the line of peter arment from baird equity research your line is open peter arment yes good afternoon mark and gerry mark aslett hi peter peter arment mark you had some great contract announcements this quarter is there a way to kind of break it down on a percentage basis of what – what is new versus what is kind of follow on i mean it looks like a lot that awards are followon or maybe the scope is expanded so in and itself may be a new win but is there a way to view that mark aslett it’s hard to say you know in terms of the actual awards themselves i mean if you look at what we see hopping in a very high level what’s driving the growth is really the industry trends that i talked about all in my prepared remarks specifically the flight to quality which is a pretty big deal and we are taking share and there is a number of specific things that either we have won or are in pursuit in the radar as well as in the ew domain that you know are important programs for us the second one is clearly our customers are outsourcing more and you know it’s not just about affordability that clearly seeking companies that are able to innovate and i mean mercury is a very innovative company and we’ve seen that on existing programs such as patriot where we continuing to chip away and win more business on the program likewise on sewip where again we’re continuing to win more content on both block  as well as block  the one that havent really spoken a lot about that i think is really in the early stages is the delayering of supply chains inside of our customers as well as the government is they are seeking again greater affordability and to gain access to more innovative companies we think that this is a potentially significant opportunities for us longer term as we kind of moved up the value chain from that tier  to mid tier  beyond that what we’re also seeing is really growth in our five major kinds of market segments its radar and ew modernization is alive and well we’re seeing some great opportunities there the move into the ci with the introduction of our new secure rackmount server we’re pretty excited about we think that could potentially be faster time to money than some of the more embedded secure processing applications as well with the acquisition of ces we pick up some new market expansion and potential content expansion opportunities there the other thing that i would say that were seeing is that we are clearly seeing demand for – in the missiles and munitions domain i think in the shortterm that is being driven by you know higher use in theatre but we’re also talking to our customers about the potential of bringing new capabilities to bear on some nextgeneration systems and i think the final one is that we saw ph a pretty significant increase in our international and foreign military sales and that we expect to continue here so i mean without mentioning specific programs we feel just based on where we’re at with the trends and how weve aligned the business we’re in very good shape peter arment yes that’s helpful color and just on the international bookings itself i think you mentioned it was up i believe  times in the quarter is there an even specific there you can point to mark aslett yeah i mean on an ltm basis international defense revenues including fms is actually up  yearoveryear patriot is a big piece of that as well you know we’ve seen some strong revenues associated with indiscernible as well peter arment terrific thanks i’ll get back in queue mark aslett okay operator thank you our next question is from the line of michael ciarmoli of suntrust your line is open michael ciarmoli hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions maybe mark or gerry just a housekeeping back to that target model i think you talked a couple times about higher rd and more estimate ph should we assume that you’re still going to be in sort of that a  to  range for rd or just anything shift around given maybe that focus mark aslett so we’re actually higher than that right now mike and may stay a little elevated that  to  is the longer term target for us michael ciarmoli okay okay on the continuing resolution it sounds like youre comfortable with the revenue but you know the bookings you guys have been putting up have been pretty tremendous here do you see any impact from an extended cr or budget environment hitting the bookings and you know maybe even separately do you think the bookings environment can hold sort of this volume that you’ve been running at mark aslett so i mean we’ll see we feel like q could be a strong quarter for us as we kind of look forward we havent completed our planning we do expect that the first half of ‘ could be a little weaker than the second half and that is very consistent with what weve seen in the past two or three years so really no change there we had literally and probably in the last seven years so we didn’t see any significant changes i think that the rhythm of the business will be what it is being in years past michael ciarmoli got it and then just last one for me on delta i think you guys said they had a  million backlog can you give us any color on how that’s trended and i think even the maybe the implied renewed run rate looks to be about  million a quarter which seems to be up from where they were running just want to make sure i got the math square on that mark aslett yes so i’ll talk at it at a high level then gerry can kind go through the numbers to say so the – it’s a great business i think we are pretty pleased to been able to acquire it’s audited to the capabilities that we have and so some great programs the business is on a pretty significant growth trajectory we see the opportunity of harvesting some pretty significant synergies on a cost basis as well as benefiting from the tax and so you know when you look at the price that we’ve paid on a net basis we think we got a great deal but i’ll hand it over to gerry who can maybe kind of enumerate some of the things that we see there gerry haines yes so we highlighted some of the synergy side and the tax benefit side which are fairly substantial numbers relative to the size of that acquisition so we think thats a nice way to go into it and that  you know the uptick is certainly what i’d say not representative of the past for that business and that’s part of what made us interested in it you know it’s the size of that  million backlog relative to the  ph revenue they had at december st is obviously a pretty clear in balance we diligence pretty hard when we look at the acquisitions to validate what we see is the pipeline of opportunities as well as the technologies and capabilities that they have and so on and then we think about how can we leverage that inside of our channel so we like what we saw and you he picked up you know we expect about a  million revenue contribution for the year which is all q which is the only period of ownership of that acquisition so kind of step function there if you will in the overall growth rate of that business and then as we begin to fork in the synergies over time i mean kind of harmonized with our model some of that means we’ll invest like in rd some of it means we’ll take advantage of our channel and try to help them continue to grow in a way that they have so we’re very excited about it michael ciarmoli got it thanks a lot guys i’ll jump back in the queue gerry haines sure operator thank you and our next question is from the line of jonathan ho of william blair company your line is open jonathan ho hi good afternoon just wanted to start out in terms of the phoenix facility and just maybe get a sense from you in terms of a little bit more color on what the strategic differentiation could come from that facility and you know what it allows you to do differently than before you have the facility mark aslett yes it’s a great question jonathan so the biggest thing is that is a sort of trusted manufacturing facility and if you move from just generalize processing into secure processing which you know is a major area of focus for us more and more the government wants and our customers the primes want to be able to see that not only the technology the problem to the technology but as a trusted supply chain associated with it in terms of the development and the manufacturing so we’ve had a number of customers kind of walk through that facility literally and we’re still completing to build out and one particular customer on a very large naval radar pursuit that we’re going after literally walk out and said you guys are  years ahead of the other company that is the incumbent on the program we clearly see that mercury is leaning in investing not only in rf but also in the trusted manufacturing associate with secure processing so you know for us its something that weve been doing for some period of time this facility came through after the acquisition of microsemi and we’re pretty excited of the potential that it provides on the couple of major secure add ph one processing opportunities that we’re in the midst of pursuing right now so you know we think it’s an important part of our business model jonathan jonathan ho great and then just going back to the cr i mean it seems like your confidence level is much higher this time around relative to the last round of continuing resolution that we saw few years ago i am just wondering you know what is it about the business at this juncture is it the backlog what is it thats giving you that sort of stronger visibility and better control over the business mark aslett sure so we clearly have got a much higher backlog than we’ve had in years past as you know that is been an area of focus for us because it’s a means by which we can derisk the business we’ve also said at our annual investor day that we now have got a much bigger business we’ve got many more programs so we got greater program diversity and we’ve got more programs producing its higher rates than what we had in the past i think beyond that as i said in my prepared remarks we also feel that our business model is working extremely well we are taking share and we’re seeing a lot of activity based upon the capability set and the investments that weve made so not to say that there isn’t risk because there is but we feel that we’re monitoring it well and we wouldn’t raise our guidance with q had we felt that we wouldn’t be able to deliver that so right now we feel in pretty good shape jonathan ho great thank you mark aslett all right jonathan operator thank you and our next question is from the line of brian ruttenbur of drexel hamilton your line is open brian ruttenbur yes thank you very much couple of quick questions so just to summarize you see no changes in kind of your nearterm revenue fourth quarter revenue because of – or due to changes with the budget to cr it again kicked down for the whole government fiscal year what about sequestration what about if the government does pass a fiscal budget by friday and let’s say they call in a supplemental give me some levers that oh this is good this is bad and maybe help me gauge by how much are not at all any of this in the fourth quarter mark aslett yes i mean ultimately it comes down to the to the programs that we have in backlog that we’re executing against you know for the fourth quarter and as i say we kind of went through and we scrub the programs themselves so any potential impact with respect to a cr in q and we’ve taken that into account in the guidance and we’ve obviously raised the guidance you know excluding ces and then we have delta and then we are adding delta on top so right now we obviously feel comfortable and confident with the increased outlook that we have just given gerry haines i think it’s important to note that when we talk backlog right we are talking funded backlog and i think thats a critical point its unlike the sort of multiyear backlog that you might see in some larger businesses which are funded on a you know the yearbyyear basis so its just not the same and you know it’s a biggest risk in a sequestration situation is – sorry in a cr situation is lack of new programs starts but as mark pointed out we’re much more reliant on programs that are actually ramping up in production so they are at different phases of their lives not new program starts for the most part of course we look for new program opportunities all the time but you’ve heard us talk for a long time about content expansion capturing share from competitors and so on those aren’t new program concepts those are existing program concepts so we’re heavily weighted on that direction and that’s what’s helped to fuel our backlog mark aslett and you will see what happens when the administration submits the fy ’ request which i am hearing is kind of in the mid may timeframe so we’ll see what that looks like and we’ll compare what they submit with the internal plan that we’re in the midst of building for next fiscal year and beyond brian ruttenbur okay all right thank you just a follow up on acquisitions plans and what are they in the near term do you need time to digest before you make any additional large acquisitions or should we expect only small bolton as in  million in revenue size that side or do you feel prepared to take on large acquisitions at this point in time gerry haines so as i said in my prepared remarks i think we – the internal team that we have doing the integration is doing an amazing job i mean the speed at which we are converting legacy erp applications and building out you know the facilities with the new manufacturing capabilities that are important for us to continue or harvest longterm synergies they are just doing great the speed at which we’re able to move on the smaller ones is much more rapid so we are doing a good job there as it relates to the size of acquisitions nothing is really changed we’ll continue to look at the smaller ones as i said on the call as well as we’ll continue to look at building a pipeline of larger opportunities thats why we went out and raised the money to be able to do both of those things brian ruttenbur so in summary you feel prepared to take on the large acquisition in the very near term or do you need more timing to digest gerry haines well you know we’re busy with the two that we just acquired but if the right acquisition came along you know we would take a run at it brian ruttenbur okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question is from the line of ronald epstein from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open kristine liwag hey good afternoon guys it’s kristine liwag calling in for ron mark aslett hi kristine kristine liwag hi as you move up the supply chain to be a mid tier ph provider is there a structural difference in margins compared to being a lower tier supplier for example do you anticipate any changes in contracts structure or do you take on more integration risk or perhaps as a higher rd or integration or investment required mark aslett not we see right now i think that the value that we are bringing as we kind of move from modules and subassemblies into subsystems is that you know we are in effect integrating our own technology or preintegrating our own technology so you know we’re providing better affordability to our customers and then doing it inhouse our solutions typically end up being delivered more quickly at lower risk and you know we’re already doing that you know it’s a big part of our revenues today and we don’t see a significant change as we continue to see that part of our business grow kristine liwag and then – that’s helpful and then maybe to clarify you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have a  million in your revolver and  in your universal shelf filing i was wondering is this before or after the delta microwave acquisition mark aslett so all of that is after delta and its  left on the shelf that’s just untapped you know issue ability if you will the  million revolver obviously is something we can borrow and repay from time to time but its unused so far and then we have the q reported number on the balance sheet its little over  million of that  was used for the delta microwave acquisition kristine liwag okay great thank you very much mark aslett you’re welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from the line of sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies  company your line is open sheila kahyaoglu hi good evening thanks mark aslett hi sheila sheila kahyaoglu hey how are you mark so i know it’s a little bit harder to quantify now that microsemi is almost fully integrated but is it fair to say excluding microsemi and the organic profile of the business in the quarter was low doubledigit mark aslett so if you look at maybe on an ltm basis i think so actually – so i am not going to mention on a quarterly basis but if you look at the underlying growth rate in the business itself where its pretty consistent with what we’ve seen you longer term so its high singledigit low doubledigit gerry haines yes as you pointed sheila it’s a little bit unfair in a sense to try to segregate them once we really lean into the integration activities but you know i think another way of saying it is if you look at the pro forma combination of the two businesses based on historical growth rates the total is growing faster than the pro forma total would have suggested on an historical basis sheila kahyaoglu okay understood that’s why the ranges giving out numbers and i guess as we head into  how do you aid or have to quantify what your revenue growth is going to be as you think out year but how do you quantify growth maybe or give us what you’re thinking what growth from versus new market share wins or additional wins mark aslett so we’ll have more to talk about that next quarter we’re really not going to comment on fiscal year ‘ at this point sheila kahyaoglu okay and then i guess just to follow up on one of the last questions that was asked that you mentioned that you are just starting to go to market with the rack server offering mark aslett yes sheila kahyaoglu i was just wondering is this – if you go to does the sales force go to market in the same ways is there any change in  i guess that you think about your target sga model is it still the  to  range gerry haines yes there shouldn’t really be any change in our sga i think the difference between this particular product and some of the work that we do in the embedded systems domain this is more of a product sale targeting what we have discussed in the past where with the likes of ibm exiting the blade server marketplace and as our customers are seeking you know more domestic capabilities and secure processing from trusted suppliers that’s left a gap in the marketplace that we are seeking to fill with both our rackmount server as well as our blade server opportunity and we’re seeing opportunities there in various market segments of large groundbased radars where historically we haven’t participated launch surveillance platforms there to be used different types of computing versus what we have provided historically to undersea activity so these are potentially new areas for us with this the capability so we’re pretty excited about the opportunities that obviously things take time but right now based on the feedback that weve gotten there is a definite market need and we’re wellpositioned to fill it sheila kahyaoglu great thank you very much gerry haines you’re welcome operator thank you and mr aslett it appears there are no further questions therefore i would like to turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks mark aslett okay well thank you very much for taking the time to listen we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter thank you operator

mominohio is right  its a catch   manufacturing costs go up all the time regardless of the country of manufacture  to maintain the quality of a product you have to raise the price  customers balk demand lower prices or decide not to buy  the company then reduces the price but the quality suffers and customers wont buy an inferior product  then the company suffers its employees suffer and the economy suffers  unfortunately consumers cant have it both ways  ive been disappointed many times with decreasing quality  id rather pay more and maintain the quality im accustomed to buying report

turn the call over to mercurys president and ceo mark aslett mark aslett thanks gerry good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us i’ll begin today’s call with a business update gerry will review the financials and guidance and then well open it up to your questions mercury continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter of fiscal  industry trends appear to be improving and our strategy is working our acquired and organic businesses performed extremely well and we came in at or above the high end of our guidance on all of our metrics setting several records along the way mercurys total revenues for q grew  yearoveryear to a record  million and we continued to deliver strong growth organically excluding the recently acquired ces business revenues were up nearly  from q last year our largest revenue programs in the quarter were f aegis sewip filthy buzzard and reaper adjusted ebitda was a record up  yearoveryear and  of revenue well within our recently updated target financial model this was also a record second quarter for total bookings and backlog and our month forward revenue coverage continues to be strong our largest bookings in q were sewip filthy buzzard f pgk which is the precision guidance kit for our artillery shells and aegis international defense bookings including our military sales were  of total bookings versus  in q last year as we begin the second half were expecting fiscal  to be another year of solid revenue growth both organically and at a total company level our content and market expansion growth strategies are working well we are targeting what we believe to be the largest secular growth opportunity in the defense industry outsourcing by the major defense primes ph for that was previously done inhouse were actually seeing an acceleration in outsourcing demand across the customer base including locations that historically have been more inclined to do the work themselves at the same time our customers are continuing their flight to affordable higher quality innovative suppliers as a result we continue to take share from less capable competitors the strategic deals that weve completed since fiscal  have substantially expanded our capability set and our total addressable market these transactions have enabled us to provide a board range of affordable preintegrated secure processing subsystems were leveraging the new capabilities weve acquired and developed organically to drive above industry average growth were involved in franchise programs that appear to be wellfunded and are currently in or moving into production were also winning important new designs as a result we continue to expand and diversify our base of programs and consent on those programs great examples being aegis and sewip if you look at our top  revenue programs so far in fiscal  only four of them were in the top  in fiscal  and if you look at this years top  programs less than half were in the top  four years ago the new entrants in the top  now comprise  of our top  program revenue through the first half of this fiscal year this broader portfolio means low problematic ph risk and additional opportunities for growth over the past few years weve successfully leveraged internal rd investments and acquisitions to build a bestinclass portfolio of products and capabilities weve demonstrated significant value creation to our ma approach we have a strong track record of successful acquisitions and integration and our scalable platform targets a significantly expanded addressable market our vision is to be the leading commercial provider of secure sensor and mission processing subsystems overall the level of activity and secure processing upgrades rf content expansion and ew remains very high our new design win pipeline for this fiscal year is likely the largest ive seen since joining mercury our big news on the ma from this quarter was successfully closing the acquisition of ces which is now doing business as mercury mission systems international or mmsi strategically mmsi has important and complimentary capabilities in mission computing affordable safety critical avionics and platform management that are in demand from our customers these new capabilities will further expand our addressable market markets that are aligned to mercurys existing focus like mercury mmsi has exceptional technology solid engineering talent and strong leadership we believe that is an excellent fit strategically culturally and operationally between this business and mercury the business fits very well with both our markets and content expansion growth strategies and exemplifies our longterm approach to ma that is entering a new market in a relatively lowrisk way learning how to succeed that time over time and then scaling the new business as we did in rf last year with the microsemi cargo transaction it has been approximately eight months since we closed that transaction and everything continues to go extremely well the businesses are delivering good financial results and turned improved growth and strong profitability the teams are working seamlessly and are well integrated the security and networking infrastructure is being fully migrated we continue to accelerate our manufacturing efficiency initiatives and are ahead of our original plan the migration to mercurys existing erp applications is progressing well and is expected to be completed in the second half of this fiscal year as planned in total were on track to deliver the planned synergies and to complete the integration activities on time and on budget all in all we couldn’t be happier with the team how the acquired business is performing and the success of our integration efforts to date were also continuing to make good progress on our headquarters moved from chelmsford to andover massachusetts which we expect to complete in early march in addition to upgrading our headquarters facility relocating to andover provides an opportunity to modernize our engineering tools and development methodologies to a more agile approach we will also improve how we collaborate and communicate with one another across the company and how we provide cuttingedge solutions for our customers during fiscal  we demonstrated our ability to complete a large acquisition under an extensive set of financial transactions quickly and with great results going forward we intend to remain active and disciplined in our approach to ma as we work to extend our record of organic and acquisition driven growth we will continue to look for deals that are strategically aligned have the potential to be accretive in the short term and drive longterm shareholder value as we do so we will continue to target acquisitions that expand our addressable market in aerospace and defense electronics and the scale of technology platform that weve built we will remain focused on the key pillars of the business rf and secure processing while working to assemble critical and differentiated solutions of sensor and mission processing we will remain focused on small capability like tuckin acquisitions while continuing to build a pipeline of larger opportunities moving to the industry conditions as anticipated weve begun government fiscal year  with another budget continuing resolution that will continue through march on balance however the industry conditions appear to be improving and our pipeline of opportunity continues to grow the strategy were pursuing is increasing the size of our addressable markets and expanding our capabilities its clearly resonating with our customers and its consistent with the governments defense priorities and goals for procurement reform in light of mercurys strong results in q and the first half of fy  the continued success of our integration activities and our strong backlog we are again raising our fullyear guidance gerry will take you through the outlook in more detail in summary were anticipating continued strong performance both organically and in our acquired businesses in the second half of fiscal  driven by growth in our major product lines and across many of our programs as a result we believe that mercury is heading towards another strong year in fiscal  in total as we continue to grow revenue gaap income and adjusted ebitda above the industry average with that id like to turn the call over to gerry gerry gerry haines thank you mark and good afternoon again everyone before i go through the financial results ill note that unless otherwise stated we will be discussing the companys financial results comparison to prior periods and guidance on a consolidated basis this includes the ces business we acquired in q of this fiscal year as well as the lit and microsemi carveout ph businesses we acquired in fiscal  turning to our financials mercury delivered another very strong performance in the second quarter of fiscal  as bookings backlog revenue and adjusted ebitda all grew to record levels at the same time we completed yet another acquisition and expanding our addressable market and capability set overall it has been a great first half on a consolidated basis and organically total revenue for the second quarter increased  million to  million up  from q last year and exceeding the top end of our guidance of  million to  million excluding the impact of ces which we acquired on november   organic revenues would have been  million an increase of  million or  yearoveryear international revenue including foreign military sales was  of total revenue compared with  in q of last year revenue from radar and electronic warfare together accounted for  of consolidated total revenue compared with  a year ago the lower proportion reflects the larger and more diverse revenue mix for the quarter resulting from the addition of several new businesses and the associated expansion of our addressable market and revenue base radar revenue was up  yearoveryear while electronic warfare revenue grew  mercurys total bookings for the second quarter were  million up  from  million in q last year yielding a strong booktobill ratio of  we ended the second quarter with an alltime record total backlog of  million which is up  million or  from the  million of a year ago approximately  million or  of this total backlog is expected to ship within the next  months our backlog demonstrates the continued growth were seeing in our franchise program portfolio and additions to that portfolio through continued design wins content expansion and new market opportunities we continue to translate our bookings and revenue growth into solid profitability mercurys gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal  was approximately  above our q guidance and within our target business model gross margin was up  points from the prior quarter as we benefited from high royalty revenues in our q sales mix as we did in last years q when gross margin was  our q fiscal  gross margin also included a  million negative impact from the step up of inventory valuations due to purchase accounting which we discussed last quarter total q operating expenses were  million versus our guidance of  million to  million and  million for the same period last year the yearoveryear change reflects the inclusion of ces acquisition expenses and two months of ces operating results in this years q which were not included in our guidance for the quarter plus the incremental yearoveryear addition of the businesses acquired from microsemi as well as higher overall compensation expenses resulting from the companys annual compensation adjustments that went into effect in october the most recent quarters operating expenses also reflect our ongoing investments to realize planned manufacturing efficiencies and increased rd investment in our newly acquired businesses as we boost spending to align with our organic level of rd investment opex in the second quarter also included approximately  million of noncash rent expense attributable to the lease of our new headquarters driven by gaap lease accounting this duplicative noncash expense is expected to total  million approximately for the full fiscal year and will end in may of  when actual cash rent payments for the new facility commence and the lease of our current headquarters site expires gaap net income for the second quarter of fiscal  was  million or  a share this compares with  million or  of share in q last year excluding the impact of ces q net income would have been  million or  a share adjusted eps for the second quarter increased to  per share up  from  a share in q of fiscal  and above the high end of our guidance range of  to  a share excluding the impact of ces adjusted eps would have been  a share this is based on approximately  million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter mercury’s q fiscal  adjusted ebitda increased  to  million from  million a year ago representing  of revenue and well above our guidance range of  million to  million for the quarter turning to the balance sheet reflecting the ces acquisition and anticipated higher capital expenditures mercury ended the second quarter of fiscal  with cash and cash equivalents of  million compared with  million a year earlier and  million at the beginning of this fiscal year the balance sheet also reflects a noncash liability of  million associated with estimated but as yet unearned future potential benefits under the swiss statutory employee pension plan for ces this is simply a result of accounting for the plan under us gaap the plan is fully funded for all current benefit obligations from a cash flow perspective mercury’s operating cash flow of  million for q of fiscal  was partially offset by  million of capital expenditures this yielded  million of free cash flow compared with  million in q of fiscal  net capital expenditures this quarter were lower than we anticipated due to modest delays in the timing of certain spending and earlier than anticipated reimbursements for intended improvements in our new headquarters location this reflects only the timing of expenditures and reimbursements and were pleased that the project remains on time and on plan as we begin the second half of fiscal  mercury’s financial position remains strong weve maintain flexibility on our capital structure and good access to capital with a moderate level of debt an untapped  million revolving credit facility and  million of remaining capacity on our universal shelf registration as a result we are wellpositioned to continue executing on our capital deployment strategy supporting future growth both organically and through acquisitions i’ll turn now to our financial guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year  for purposes of modeling and guidance we’ve assumed no restructuring and no acquisition or financing related expenses and an effective tax rate of  in the periods discussed once again we expect the second half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first half based on the strength of our bookings and backlog and the results of our accelerated acquisition and integration efforts which should begin yielding planned savings and increased operating leverage as the year progresses as a result we are once again raising our revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance for the full year even before the inclusion of ces we also expect strong operating  positive operating cash flow for the balance of the fiscal year partially offsetting that we now anticipate that q will be our peak quarter for capex in fiscal  with capital expenditures expected to be approximately  million to  million this reflects the incremental addition of the acquired businesses completion of our new headquarters and the acceleration of our acquisition and integration activities even with the elevated level of capex expected for q we expect free cash flow to be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half as capital spending tapers down in h and we begin seeing the benefit of the operating leverage associated with the more highly integrated business our integration plan remains on track and we anticipate realizing the estimated  million of originally projected run rate synergies well within the timeframe laid out in our initial plans with approximately twothirds of those run rate synergies being realized within the first two years with that as background for the third quarter of fiscal  were forecasting total revenue which includes ces to be in the range of  million to  million gross margin for q is expected to be approximately  this reflects a lower impact from purchase accounting inventory valuation stepups more than offset by lower royalty revenues and other more modest changes in our q sales mix q gaap net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per share adjusted eps for q is expected to be in the range of  to  per share this estimate assumes approximately  million of amortization of intangible assets  million of fair value adjustments from purchase accounting and  million of stockbased compensation expense adjusted ebitda for the third quarter is expected to be in the range of  million to  million representing approximately  to  of revenue at the forecasted revenue range this includes  million of noncash rent expense attributable to the lease for our new headquarters as well as modestly increased operating expenses associated with our integration and rd spending plans as i said were also raising our guidance for the full year before the addition of ces we now expect our base revenue for the full fiscal year to increase to between  million and  million up from our prior guidance of  million to  million which also excluded ces including ces we now expect mercurys total revenue to be in the range of  million to  million for all of fiscal  total gaap net income for fiscal  including ces is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  a share we currently expect total adjusted ebitda for all of  to be approximately  million to  million an increase of  to  yearoveryear and at approximately  to  of revenue for the year well within the range established by our updated current target business model adjusted eps for fiscal  is now expected to be approximately  to  per share in summary weve concluded the first half of fiscal  with record performance across multiple dimensions including forward indicators such as bookings and backlog growth our content and market expansion growth strategies position us well in todays defense industry environments our program base is becoming larger and more diversified and we have proven our ability to expand our addressable market and drive profitable growth through disciplined ma reflecting these positive dynamics we believe that mercury is on track for a year of strong growth and solid financial performance in fiscal  with that we will be happy to take your questions operator you can proceed with the qa now questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question will come from the line of jason gursky with citi please proceed jason gursky hi good afternoon everyone mark aslett hi jason jason gursky mark can i start with the question for you as you have had an opportunity here to reflect on the new administration could you talk a little bit about the potential for policy reform or procurement reform that might be coming down the horizon and what would be good for mercury and what would be a bad outcome if we were to see some procurement reform mark aslett sure so i dont think we expect a significant change overall in terms of the focus on improving the affordability of the goods and services of the dod procures i think that is going to ensure just based upon what weve heard from president trump and that ends up as we have said previously ends up actually being a catalyst for increased outsourcing because given our model were able to do things more quickly and more affordably than many of our customers are able to do things inhouse so yes i think that is by far the primary driver what could be a negative is if they decided not to focus on improving the overall affordability levels jason gursky okay that is great and then hi gerry just i was wondering given the recent acquisition whether you could update us on some relative ship set values for mercury specifically i would love to hear some updated thoughts on f ship set content relative to f and then ship set value on the very navy ships just kind of rank order where you have got the most content after the recent acquisition gerry haines sure so we don’t typically comment jason in terms of the ship sets values on any particular program or platform but i think as we laid out at our investor day weve been very successful not only expanding our addressable market which has gone from approximately  billion when we were simply a processing product provider at the tier  level to today as we kind of moved into the rf marketplace and most recently with the acquisition of ces moving into more mission computing avionics as well as platform management is that market on a global basis for just what we do is over  billion if you go back to some of the examples that we gave at investor day i think we have done a really good job taking either the investments that weve made internally in organic rd or the acquired businesses and turning that into expanded content own different programs so we talked at investor day about the naval surface fleet and how we have gone from literally just providing the processing associated with the radar largely for domestic applications to now were also providing capabilities for fms with sewip we moved into the electronic warfare suite we now are providing capabilities for the signals intelligence on both of these platforms we are involved in the ci on programs such as the nmt which is the navy multiband terminal and we continue to see opportunities as we made investments in our server class blade server architecture to moving to other parts of the compute architectures onboard so i didnt directly answer your question in terms of the ship set volume but the reason that our revenues are growing much faster than the overall industry average is because our strategy is working jason gursky okay thats fair thanks guys gerry haines sure operator thank you our next question will come from the line of jonathan ho with william blair please proceed jonathan ho hi guys congratulations on the strong quarter i just wanted to start out with the ces acquisition and is there any way that you could maybe help us with thinking in terms of the growth rate for that business and whether theres any seasonality either in the bookings expenses or revenue for that business that maybe differs from your current business mark aslett so we obviously didn’t give up a ton of detail its a relatively small acquisition so we don’t expect it to move the needle meaningfully through the year jonathan i guess couple of high points ces is a profitable business its a growing business we think it aligns pretty well with our overall sort of financial profile as we said at the time of the acquisition it is slightly dilutive on an as acquired basis to our adjusted ebitda but we also expect that there will be realizable synergies that will bring it into line with our operating model in the relatively short period of time we generally look for things like that to happen within about the first year ownership so we’ve take all of that by the way into account in issuing our guidance for the quarter and for the year so thats why i was careful to highlight that where i was including ces and then distinguishing the changes in guidance both pre and post the acquisition did that help jonathan ho yes perfect and then just in terms of the operating leverage that youre seeing in the model can you may be break it down for us a little bit more in terms of how much of this is coming from the cost synergies from prior acquisitions how much from sort of the mix changes and sort of the royalties and then also thoughts in terms of how much additional leverage we can look for throughout the course of the year mark aslett sure so i think gerry talked about the gross margins and just the impact that mixes had and will continue to a have in any particular period we still think that the range that we’ve given in terms of our updated target business model is fine but it can’t move around periodtoperiod yes i think the benefits that we’re getting from an operating leverage perspective is as a result of our integration efforts which continue to go extremely well as you know we’re not a holding company we are deeply integrating the businesses that we acquire from a channel and from a process and from a systems perspective and it’s really that that is yielding the leverage that weve seen and i think our belief is that we will continue to be able to grow our expenses at a rate that is slightly less than the overall top line so we’ll continue to see some of that operating leverage manifest itself and as gerry said in his prepared remarks the integration activities is going well which is why we think that the second half will be stronger than the first gerry haines just a little bit you will recall that at the beginning of the year we said we thought we could touch our updated ie stepped up  basis point target operating model as you heard from the guidance update that we just gave we think we’re going to get into that model ie not just hit the  but somewhere in the  to  range for the year and that’s reflecting exactly what mark talked about jonathan ho got it and just one final one just qualitatively i mean when we think about the new administration and some of the commentary that they have had specifically for prime contractors are you starting to see those primes come you more often is there sort of a tipping point which could maybe drive an acceleration in that interest level mark aslett yes so im not sure whether its directly related to the new administration because i think that is still obviously very early days but as i said in my prepared remarks i think there are two really trends that are clearly more pronounced the one is that we are seeing more outsourcing occurring and even in parts of our customer base that historically have tended to do more of the work inhouse which is a very encouraging sign overall the second is what i described is really a flight to quality and our customers are really seeking to do business with a smaller number more capable suppliers who are really focusing on affordability higher quality as well as innovation and here mercury is clearly one of those i think its like an old adage never waste a good dancer yes we leaned into the period post sequestration and invested significantly in the business and i think that’s one of the reasons that we’re seeing the heightened activity level that i described in my prepared remarks jonathan ho thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of peter arment with baird equity research please go ahead peter arment hi yes good evening guys nice results mark could i just call out on the gross margin side specifically really nice results this quarter but weve seen kind of a lot of volatility if i think back over the last several quarters i know its tied to a lot of the acquisitions and the mix but what is the right way to think about kind of margins in the second half of the year gerry haines yes so i’ll take that one peter as weve said sometimes in the past the gross margin will tend to move around a little bit within the range we’ve established of  to  and that’s really driven largely by mix some of which is offset in that mix by other changes down the opex line so for example higher and lower levels of customer funded rd which will shift some of our costs up into the revenue and cost of goods sold line so we really think that it may not be the best way to look at the business tracking at the gross margin level and look more into the operating and adjusted ebitda margins and there we’ve seen very steady progressive upticks over time and then of course the step function upward in our target model and that’s reason for that we do see mix shifts but even with those mix shifts and the little bit of spikiness by things like royally revenues which obviously would carry very high margin does tend to normalize over time up in way id like to say it is if you think about ranges  to  that we on average will tend to hover around the middle of that plus or minus a point or  any quarter which is not as noteworthy as it might seem on its face peter arment it’s very helpful and just followup on capex so this year particularly the step up is there a way to think about kind of what’s maintenance capex for this for the business because we’ve seen a lot of changes with the microsemi carveout and now ces gerry haines yes so we haven’t forecasted capex to accept obviously to say what we thought it was going to be in q which i did just update but as weve noted it’s the spike or the uptick has been driven by several fairly distinct things obviously we’ve had some significant incremental addition through the various acquired business of each of which brings a little bit of capex with it generally speaking i would say the profile is similar to what we have done historically at mercury on a propionate basis but when we’re seeing separate upticks caused by investment in the acquisition synergies and the program that we initiated and then we’ve accelerated some of that investment which has stacked it up and then of course we’ve mentioned the build out of the headquarters so those are kind of the three factors acquired businesses build out of the headquarters and acceleration on the synergies program that are really driving it but nothing in the basic profile of the business has really increased its overall capital intensity peter arment got it and one last one mark one for you just on the the overall cr thats in place it looks like expectations are that were going to see that hopefully resolve in early april or at the end of march if it lingers materially beyond that is that  how is that affecting what you’ve allocated to your outlook mark aslett yes we’ve got pretty good visibility i think we’ve got strong forward revenue coverage had a great bookings quarter backlogs at record levels so we feel pretty comfortable with the increased guidance that we gave peter peter arment right thanks nice results mark aslett thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of michael ciarmoli with suntrust please proceed michael ciarmoli hey good evening guys thanks for taking the questions real nice results mark maybe can you just talk about you talked about the design wins you talked about this hit list i guess being the largest ever can you give us a sense of may be what specific markets you’re seeing those design wins in are you starting to see may be more of a penetration into that missile market which is going to be new and obviously an expansion for you on the microsemi deal mark aslett sure so it’s a number of things mike so our two largest market segments today are radar as well as ew we’re seeing increased investments in both of those areas so seeing that shift from the older type radars to the more user type radars we’ve done a pretty good job capturing the secure processing content that shift occurs were also capturing more rf content on those radars which historically we haven’t done were seeing a significant uptick in ew which is driving growth in what was formally the mercury defense systems segment which is the former core acquisition on the west coast as well as significant growth in our rf businesses and that we anticipate continuing going forward the third area i think is you alluded to is also in the guided missile and precision munitions domain obviously we are expending a lot of weapons based upon what is happening in indiscernible right now so i think the stockpile has been depleted at the same time were seeing opportunities to insert new technologies and capabilities to deal with some of the more advanced threats we see occurring and we believe that were very well positioned there whether it be adding secure processing to some of those missile systems whether it would be adding some miniaturized ew capabilities or just more general rf capabilities so those are the three major trends that were seeing and the design win pipeline is very very healthy right now michael ciarmoli got it given that pipeline given what you just said should we expect this backlog to continue to grow through the second half of this year mark aslett well backlog is not something that we typically forecast mike but were certainly hoping it will michael ciarmoli got it and then just if we were to look out at some of these big programs within the industry jstars the trainer groundbased deterring three dealer what i mean you guys still have a lot of opportunities out there a lot of radar i mean should we expect or how are you guys looking at some of those programs are they on that sort of hit list that you currently just referenced mark aslett yes some of the ones all that youve mentioned yes for sure yes we think were well positioned with jstars just given some of the investments that we have made in the very high performance processing that was recently tested at one of the government labs where we got very very high marks there are other programs that maybe less well known that again are going through tech refresh whether it be in radar or ew that potentially significant opportunities for mercury that were also pursuing i mean just this past week we were notified that three new design wins in the rf dimension that are great wins one of which is an outsourcing and two of which are competitive displacements so we feel actually really good about how we are positioned from a capabilities perspective the investments that weve made in manufacturing infrastructure and the automation is making us more affordable and i think we feel pretty good about how were located right now mike michael ciarmoli got it and then just gerry corporate tax reforms you guys got  tax rate i would imagine that anything would be very beneficial to you guys because can you give us same color on how youre thinking about that gerry haines well i think you kind of hit it we are a corporate taxpayer we are mostly us based revenue so we pay a pretty hefty load so any discussion that ive heard about tax rates is that if it moves it is going to move down which would certainly be a benefit to us but were not going to model that in and hope its not a strategy we will hope for it and if we get it that will just be a good thing michael ciarmoli sounds good guys thanks a lot for taking the questions gerry haines thanks mike operator thank you our next question will come from the line of brian ruttenbur with drexel hamilton please proceed brian ruttenbur yes thank you very much couple of questions i hear that the growth is going to come initially maybe in readiness programs and then weve also had conversations about fms orders and growth happening there can you address both of those and what youre seeing on that front and if there has been any pickup as of yet gerry haines you are talking about potentially where president trump will put any increase in defense money is that the question brian brian ruttenbur the question is do you have any indications that youre going to have increased spending on the fms orders or is there going to be an easement i know its only a couple of days into the administration but i didnt know if youve seen anything i think youve run what is your normal percentage for fms gerry haines so it has changed over the last year or so it was in the high teens maybe even the low s but as we kind of acquired great diversity of programs is overall percentage that number has come down i would say its too early to tell in terms of the new administration but as we have seen or as we have said previously a lot of our major programs have got fms sales associated with it so yes its our customers succeed is they are seeking to penetrate those marketplaces so we could drive along and one of the things that you are probably aware of is that there is an enhanced intensity on making sure that is we export our technologies overseas or also refresh our systems here domestically the security is part of those refresh and so the emphasis and the investment that weve made on our nextgeneration secure processing product portfolio we think bodes well to help enable those sales to occur in a timely manner brian ruttenbur okay and then in terms of readiness do you have any exposure in there and would you see anticipate to see any increase in spending or orders because of maybe increased strip levels on the readiness side gerry haines not really brian yes i think the readiness side is not an area that we as a company have really participated in historically from what im reading it sounds like this may be one of the beneficiaries of increased spending could be the navy and the air force and that transfer the majority of where our revenues are coming from today and were obviously involved in some great programs there and are well positioned brian ruttenbur great thank you very much operator thank you our next question will come from the line of ron epstein with bank of america please proceed ronald epstein hey good evening guys gerry haines hi ron ronald epstein following up on one of the topics you were talking about you mentioned in increased outsourcing that youre using from the defense primes on the contracts that have been up for bid can you give us a feel for what your win rate has been gerry haines its a good question its hard to specifically say what our win rate is i will tell you that literally as i said just a minute ago on three awards that we received last week we haven’t actually received the po yet but weve been notified two of those were actually competitive displacements in the rf microwave domain into pretty important programs so i think the way in which were being viewed is that is one of those more capable suppliers right weve got a very high rd spend which is critically important to our customers that are seeking more technology weve invested in the infrastructure in terms of the manufacturing assets to make us more affordable and to produce high quality and then if i step back part of the business model that we have is because we are actually at the tier  level and because were a merchant supplier we are actually in many instances able to bid concurrently with multiple primes as they are competing for the governments business now it doesn’t always work out that way but wherever we can that is certainly a strategy that we like to pursue ronald epstein i mean it seems like there is some momentum gaining in this outsourcing space are you seeing any new competitors coming to the market mark aslett no and not i think if anything we are seeing in the rf domain a shift from the primes doing business purely on the basis of trying to get a better price to recognizing that the strategy is not the best way of improving affordability in the long term and so there is kind of a move in the other direction a shift from simply trying to procure through the procurement process better terms to partnering for success in the longterm which requires investments and requires much earlier level of engagement and that’s really what we are seeing so we are seeing a shift in terms of just the supply chain strategies but we clearly feel that its actually benefiting mercury based upon the strategy that we’ve been pursuing ronald epstein great and then may be just a more technical question for gerry when you think about the prospects of this change in tax code if you can no longer deduct interest does that change how you think about doing ma gerry haines well i suppose it could as a theoretical matter youd have to consider what the impact is as you know youre not operating like traditional private equity shop turning extremely high levels of debt i think there are frankly a lot of things to consider there not only debt levels andor relative debt levels turns what are the effective interest rates how do you balance that against the anticipated growth rates and what you think you can do with the business and then the deductibility the interest so i’d say it’s a multifaceted equation that is not susceptible to an easy answer but you have to consider all the factors ronald epstein okay i am done now thanks guys operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from the line of sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies please proceed sheila kahyaoglu hi good afternoon guys mark aslett hi sheila sheila kahyaoglu so what’s the i guess i don’t know if i missed it but could you talk about the growth outlook for that business and may be if you could give us some color on if there were particular platforms that were attracted with the acquisition or does it just add to your international portfolio mark aslett so that the business itself is actually i’m looking to name the specific progress because unfortunately i think it’s not something that we can do at this time but they have got some broad exposure to some wide body platforms the heart of that business is that they are providing the computing elements for many of the tactical communication systems on platforms for large communications defense electronics company based here domestically in the us so it actually got a very broad exposure with that particular focus area sheila kahyaoglu so it sort of puts you in i guess the cost pit a little bit further is that kind of where it is aiming to add like that mark aslett yes so in the ci mission systems segment is where they primarily play sheila kahyaoglu okay and i guess you had a fairly large contract in october on the precision munitions side and i guess i’m assuming that is a legacy microsemi business is there an opportunity there to i don’t know how much you can dispose but to add on to your legacy mercury business in terms of new potential customer anything you could disclose on that order mark aslett yes sure so the the business that we acquired from microsemi has got a strong position in the guided missile and precision munitions marketplace so their own programs such as small diameter bomb ii which as you know is going to be the one of the missiles that goes on to the f that are on the paveway which is obviously seeing increased growth just given the off tempo but they’ve also got other pursuits as well and literally just in the last few weeks we have introduced them give then the strength of our channel into one of our major customers missile systems divisions where they haven’t historically done any business and we’ve already uncovered a number of opportunities so i do think that given the capabilities of the combined companies and the strength of our channel this will continue to be an important area certainly one of the things that attracted us to the business that we acquired sheila kahyaoglu right thank you and then i guess just a last one if you could give us any color on the blades have the opportunity and in terms of what youre seeing in your bookings or design wins mark aslett yes so the blades overall opportunity were excited about were seeing some pretty significant growth in the ci market segment as well as actually in our processing product line yes its still very early days we just announced it at one of the major trade shows but because its a very unique product targeting a specific application we do think its a part of the business and its going to grow in the long term weve already won some specific business with it a number of customers have requested access to the product to test in their various facilities and we think its got some good growth potential longer term and it is very much in line with the trend that weve in the more embedded applications where high performance secure embedded processing is really what our customers are looking for and we come up with a pretty unique set of technologies and capabilities for that sheila kahyaoglu sure thank you very much mark aslett you are welcome operator thank you our last question will come from the line of keith curtis with indiscernible capital please proceed unidentified analyst yes hi just wanted to ask about the ebitda contribution from ces and you broke it out for this quarter but i didn’t notice any breakout on the contribution and the updated guidance for the year mark aslett yes thats correct we didn’t break it out because as you probably know were an integrator and we integrate the businesses relatively rapidly and once we start to collapse channel and collapse salesforce as well as some of the internal support operations the distinctions very quickly go away and it becomes rather difficult to figure out where and how to measure specific contributions so thats why and we don’t expect that well be breaking it out in the future unidentified analyst okay and just a followup on that earlier in your prepared remarks i think you said something about ebitda being diluted free synergies so just looking for clarification on that mark aslett yes the ebitda percentage that it brings in the door is a little bit lower than where the organic business is on day one but we expect and we said this at the time of the acquisition as well that we would be able to lift them into alignment with ours in a relatively short term unidentified analyst got it thanks for that mark aslett sure operator thank you and our last question will come from the line of mark jordan with noble financial please proceed mark jordan thank you a question relative to rd obviously with acquisitions that aren’t  quarter rd spend has increased pretty significantly here and with the addition of ces for full quarter probably you would expect some growth looking out as a normalized run right favorably towards fiscal  are there synergies in that member or should we assume that rd as a percent of revenue is going to stay around that  range of revenue gerry haines yes so we expect over the long terms that we will maintain a run rate of  to  spend annually that we call for in our target business model if you look back in recent periods weve sometimes been a bit higher than that but we continue to invest and whats happening is that the revenue is growing at a faster rate than the spend on the rd overall so we expect to settle right into that range and frankly would seek to maintain it because we see it as a significant competitive advantage for us we have differentiated ourselves through a variety of technologies it is one of the reasons that as weve acquired businesses weve taken a close look at what their spend is and in some cases and weve highlighted this in the prepared remarks weve set up spending plans that actually bring them into alignment with our overall rate of spend because again we want to be at the edge of those technology capabilities particularly as we seek to integrate them into more subsystem integrated solutions that we are providing to our customers so it has played out very well for us and we look to continue doing that as we go forward mark jordan a final question from me with the ces being acquired obviously a swiss company you mentioned that they sell significantly into the united states have you looked through is there any export issues that you might have where their customer base is either might be restricted given the fact that they are now a part of a us corporation mark aslett no we don’t think that there is anything negative in terms of how our ownership of them we think if anything we can potentially open some market opportunities particularly over time and thats why we focus on what the addressable market is not just what business theyre doing today mark jordan okay thank you mark aslett sure operator thank you mr aslett it appears there are no further questions therefore i would like to turn the call back over to you for closing remarks sir mark aslett okay well thank you everyone for joining the call this evening were very pleased with the results this quarter and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter thank you operator

room for education textbooks one reason is simple while the internet may be everywhere its not always accurate and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information thats why approved textbooks are so important they give you the facts not the opinions of someone on the internethelp for the home schooledno one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children there is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their childrens education on the aspects engl are most important to them and tailor the curriculum to their own childs individual learning styles from science and mathematics to english and history textbooks are a vital part of any education programfor every age levelno matter what age or grade level your student is at there are education textbooks to cover their needs even if they go to a regular grade school there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it not every book is the right fit for every student and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbookexplore adult educationeducation isnt just for children many adults have a need for textbooks too from those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their ged to professionals looking to further their development theres a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life its not just academic textbooks you can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management to woodworking and auto repaircontrol your college educationcollege is more than just an investment in your future its an investment one way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks many textbooks especially in fields such as english and history do not change much from year to year so grabbing last years engineering handbook may
