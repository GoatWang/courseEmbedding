seed stage as weve pursued this goal weve been fortunate to back hundreds of startups meet the entire collective here’s what we believe  we have great empathy for founders we’ve been there second generation pharmacist tj parker and his cofounder elliot cohen had a compelling vision of a robotpowered pharmacy disrupting an oligopoly isn’t for the faint of heart and we proudly invested the first capital into pillpack weve been empathic supporters ever since  great startups practice efficient entrepreneurship we believe entrepreneurs should try to raise as little money as possible to accelerate their businesses while preserving ownership startups don’t have to raise billions to be worth billions—a point proven by the trade desk which raised just m in vc before earning a billion dollar ipo  the future belongs to the weird  wonderful founder collective is deliberately antithematic we don’t have a vr thesis but when kuvee showed us the future of wine we couldn’t resist visionary founders have shown us that the weird use cases of today can become the hot themes of tomorrow   staged capital  the right amount for the right stage our seed funding enabled diaco to expand

eakman on march   we recently shared our thinking on fund investing with our post “what does a foundry group next fund investment look like” we noted that we are largely driven by people and ecosystem we want to continue laying out our thinking by talking about each of our fund investments we’ll start with our most recent fund investment founder collective and walk backwards to catch up on what was a very active first year of investing for foundry group next our recent investment in founder collective iii lp is a good example of our ecosystem thesis at work we previously worked with the founder collective “fc” partners david frankel eric paley and micah rosenbloom through shared company and fund investments we coinvested with them in makerbot pantheon and formlabs with many other shared opportunities along the way it was easy for us to get excited about fc’s prior portfolio and fund performance they have a number of highprofile company investments and importantly they are one of the few seed funds to have shipped home large boxes of cash in addition to strong valuation markups in their portfolio we also got excited about their fund discipline and investor alignment choosing to stay the same size and take more of the fund themselves i have to think that most lps are ready to invest at that point it’s fc’s partnership dynamics however that get us really excited they have strong internal dynamics that limit the noise and encourage debate to reach thoughtful decisions their history together as founders and investors makes it clear that they deeply care about each other it is those deep bonds and relationships that allow for the space needed to make good decisions across the portfolio brad’s post kindred spirits – our investment in founder collective does a nice job of laying out our shared values and goes into detail as to why we felt such a strong motivation to partner with them these are clearly our kind of people the fc strategy also shows that they deeply align themselves with and identify internally as founders the personal feedback we got from their portfolio founders was strong and their local ecosystem players noted support for their involvement as preferred investors we also knew fc had a great investor base and we would be lucky to get a chance to join that group in this new fund it was only because of shared relationships and some embarrassing cajoling that we were able to become the only new lp in their new fund we are excited to formally partner with the fc team and look forward to finding more great entrepreneurs to back
