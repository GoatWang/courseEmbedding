adjust to volatile raw material costs risks include the companys recent aggressive growth strategy intense global competition volatility of raw material costs sensitivity to business cycles and ongoing regulatory issues the stable outlook takes into account the companys solid liquidity position disciplined capital allocation strategy and fitchs expectation that credit metrics will remain

prioritizing the uses of its cash and cash flow growth strategy in  whr spent almost  billion for the acquisitions of indesit company spa a leading european manufacturer and distributor of major appliances and a  stake in hefei rongshida sanyo electric co ltd a leading manufacturer of home appliances based in hefei china the acquisition of indesit has good strategic rationale for whr as it provides the company with a broader platform to expand its european operations prior to the acquisition about  of whrs revenues were generated from this region through the first nine months of  sales from europe middle east and africa represented about  of whrs worldwide sales whr also continues to realize synergies from the acquisition ebit margins in this region increased  bps to  during the sept   yeartodate period compared with the same period last year managements goal is to achieve  ongoing ebit margin by  similarly the acquisition of a majority stake in hefei gave whr access to a large established distribution network manufacturing scale access to the china supply base as well as an experienced management team hefei has an established and broad distribution network that includes more than  outlets throughout china hefeis significant presence in rural areas complements whrs presence in chinas highertier cities the company also seeks to use its larger platform to further grow the business including achieving revenue synergies from the recent acquisitions growing its core business improving its emerging market presence and expanding its adjacent businesses stable credit metrics whrs credit metrics are appropriate for the rating debt to ebitda for the latestmonth ltm period ending june   was x up from x at the end of  and flat from the yearago period interest coverage remains strong at x for the june   ltm period compared with x during calendar  fitch expects debt to ebitda will be at around x at the end of  while interest coverage remains above x strong free cash flow generation the company generated  million of free cash flow  of revenues for the ltm period ending sept   compared with  million  during   million  during   million  during  and

repatriate these funds to support us operations debt maturities the company has significant shortterm debt  billion of cp and bank borrowings as of sept   and  billion of longterm debt maturing between  and  the potential notes issuance together with fcf expected to be generated during q will be used to pay down cp borrowings whr has demonstrated its ability to access the capital markets and refinance its debt maturities and fitch expects the company will refinance some of these debt maturities as they become due regulatory issues and other contingent liabilities there are ongoing regulatory issues in brazil that could potentially negatively affect the companys financial profile individually these issues are manageable but collectively they have the potential to result in substantial cash outflows in particular the brazilian tax disputes could increase meaningfully because of interest penalties andor changes in exchange rates whrs brazilian operations have received governmental assessments from brazil related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex credits monetized by whr from  to  and  through  the total outstanding tax assessment for income and social contribution taxes related to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately  billion brazilian reais equivalent to roughly  million as of sept   the brazilian tax authority has challenged whrs recording of certain ipi tax credits credits for purchase of raw materials in brazil for production in  and  whr elected to settle certain of these tax credits but the brazilian revenue authority notified the company that certain of these settlements were rejected and whr received tax assessments of  million brazilian reais about  million in  brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless whether the profits were repatriated whrs brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged the constitutionality of the law but the brazilian supreme court ruled on one of the cases in april  finding that the law is constitutional the case has been remanded to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in whrs appeal as of sept   the potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes is about  brazilian reais or  million the company is disputing these issues and has not accrued any amounts related to these assessments key assumptions fitchs key assumptions
