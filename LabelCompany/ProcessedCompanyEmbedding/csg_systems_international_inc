“time warner” in may in connection with the acquisition the time warner master subscriber management agreement the “time warner agreement” was assigned to charterthe combined chartertime warner revenues represented approximately  of csg’s total revenues for the quarter ended march   making charter csg’s second largest client csg’s existing agreement with charter runs through december  the time warner agreement which covers the time warner customer accounts serviced by csg and now owned by charter was originally set to expire on march   but was extended for additional onemonth periods through july   while the parties continued negotiations related to a new longterm charter consolidated master subscriber management system agreement that would provide csg products and services covering both time warner and charter customer accounts under one master agreement on july   csg entered into a new consolidated csg master subscriber management system agreement with charter the “new agreement” which supersedes all previous agreements with charter and time warner the key terms and conditions of the new agreement are as follows the new agreement is effective august   and extends csg’s contractual relationship with charter an additional  years and additionally covers the time warner customer accounts serviced by csg and now owned by charter an additional  years through december  in addition charter has the option to extend the new agreement for an additional oneyear term consistent with the previous agreements the fees to be generated under the new agreement will be
