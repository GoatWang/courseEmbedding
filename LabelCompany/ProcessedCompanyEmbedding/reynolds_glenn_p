object are disturbed and move around the object aerodynamic forces are generated between the gas and the object the magnitude of these forces depend on the shape of the object the speed of the object the mass of the gas going by the object and on two other important properties of the gas the viscosity or stickiness of the gas and the compressibility or springiness of the gas to properly model these effects aerodynamicists use similarity parameters which are ratios of these effects to other forces present in the problem if two experiments have the same values for the similarity parameters then the relative importance of the forces are being correctly modeled representative values for the properties of air are given on another page but the actual value of the parameter depends on the state of the gas and on the altitude aerodynamic forces depend in a complex way on the viscosity of the gas as an object moves through a gas the gas molecules stick to the surface this creates a layer of air near the surface called a boundary layer which in effect changes the shape of the object the flow of gas reacts to the edge of the boundary layer as if it was the physical surface of the object to make things more confusing the boundary layer may separate from the body and create an effective shape much different from the physical shape and to make it even more confusing the flow conditions in and near the boundary layer are often unsteady changing in time the boundary layer is very important in determining the drag of an object to determine and predict these conditions aerodynamicists rely on wind tunnel testing and very sophisticated computer analysis the important similarity parameter for viscosity is the reynolds number the reynolds number expresses the ratio of inertial resistant to change or motion forces to viscous heavy and gluey forces from a detailed analysis of the momentum conservation equation the inertial forces are characterized by the product of the density r times the velocity v times the gradient of the velocity dvdx the viscous forces are characterized by the dynamic viscosity coefficient mu times the second gradient of the velocity dvdx the reynolds number re then becomes re  r  v  dvdx  mu  dvdx the gradient of the velocity is proportional to the velocity divided by a length scale l similarly the second derivative of the velocity is proportional to the velocity divided by the square of the length scale then re  r  v  vl  mu  v  l re  r  v  l  mu the reynolds number is a dimensionless number high values of the parameter on the order of  million indicate that viscous forces are small and the flow is essentially inviscid the euler equations can then be used to model the flow low values of the parameter on the order of  hundred indicate that viscous forces must be considered the reynolds number can be further simplified if we use the kinematic viscosity nu that is euqal to the dynamic viscosity divided by the density nu  mu  r re  v  l  nu heres a java program to calculate the coefficient of viscosity and the reynolds number for different altitude length and speed this page shows an interactive java applet which calculates the viscosity coefficient and the reynolds number for an input velocity length and altitude to change input values click on the input box black on white backspace over the input value type in your new value and hit the enter key on the keyboard this sends your new value to the program you will see the output boxes yellow on black change value you can use either imperial or metric units and you can input either the mach number or the speed by using the menu buttons just click on the menu button and click on your selection the nondimensional mach number and reynolds number are displayed in white on blue boxes if you are an experienced user of this calculator you can use a sleek version of the program which loads faster on your computer and does not include these instructions you can also download your own copy of the program to run offline by clicking on this button the similarity parameter calculator was modified in may  by anthony vila a student at vanderbilt university during a summer intern session at nasa glenn for some problems we can divide the reynolds by the length scale to obtain the reynolds number per foot ref this is given by ref  v  nu the reynolds number per foot or per meter is obviously not a nondimensional number like the reynolds number you can determine the reynolds number per foot using the calculator by specifycing the

when a speedboat manned by islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc personnel approached american vessels the uss thunderbolt responded and went to general quarters—immediate combat readiness on the

intercepting north korean and iranian intermediate range ballistic missiles irbms with fanatics at the helm an irgc boat could be a suicide boat bomb note the iranians continue to develop longrange ballistic missiles obama’s iran deal didn’t stop that program it really didn’t stop the ayatollahs’ quest for nukes and it’s biggest failure is it doesn’t penalize bad behavior like speedboat bluff to disrupt us naval formations   posted at  am by austin bay   a blueprint for new sanctions on north korea from the center for a new american security despite the perception that north korea has long been the most sanctioned country on earth the reality is that until recently those sanctions were not very comprehensive though the un security council had passed four sanctions resolutions between  and  none of them meaningfully tightened the economic screws on north korea without this broad economic force they lacked the leverage to compel policy change or effective nuclear diplomacy instead they were narrowly targeted at specific individuals and companies involved in north korea’s nuclear program and served as more of a messaging tool with relatively limited financial consequences for north korea and its regime elites there is room to increase the economic and political pressure on north korea’s economy using sanctions and “military leverage” aggressively doing so plus targeting the international companies including many based in china that still do business with north korea could begin to curb its continued ability to generate hard currency from exports and its continued access to the international financial system this additional pressure could limit the country’s ability to generate the funds it needs for its nuclear program just as important it would restrict kim’s ability to handle any ensuing economic instability this would build critical leverage for the united states in future diplomatic negotiations with north korea over its nuclear program the study says “north korea’s international trading relationships constitute a targetrich environment” for example sanction “any bank or company involved in purchases of north korean exports – including coal minerals textiles and other products” and “craft sanctions targeting insurance companies that underwrite cargoes to and from north korea” the best model for this “tougher approach” with sanctions was the sanctions regiment “that the united states imposed on iran before the jcpoa was concluded in ” that’s the bad iran deal obama slapped together related some examples of tough sanctions and military leverage   posted at  am by austin bay   israel evaluates its readiness for war hamas and hezbollah are the daily challenges but iran is the big threat by the way iran still wants nukes the iranian regime has not given up its strategic objective of obtaining nuclear weapons the sunset clauses on the nuclear deal will lift key restrictions over the next eight to thirteen years assuming the hardline shiite ideologicalreligious camp and the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc continue to control iran’s foreign and military policies the islamic republic will be able restart its nuclear program at the end of the sunset clauses if it does not cheat and breach the agreement beforehand iran could begin enriching uranium again using improved techniques it is currently researching to bring it to nuclear breakout and could try to reach that point at a time of its choosing its missile program is already developing this means israel could find itself in a statetostate conflict in the not too distant future additionally arab sunni states threatened by iran have launched civil nuclear programs of their own these could turn out to be the initial stages of military nuclear programs designed to counter iran’s nuclear shadow more evidence that obama’s iran deal was a very bad deal   posted at  am by austin bay   kc johnson  stuart taylor betsy devos is right in college sexual assault cases due process matters a system in which a wrongly accused student’s best chance of vindication comes after his college improperly brands him a rapist and only if he can afford an expensive and protracted lawsuit is a travesty of justice moreover despite some suggestions by defenders of obama policies that colleges have responded to these court decisions by creating fairer procedures for accused students the reverse has been far more typical amidst legal challenges schools including brown and swarthmore adjusted their policies to make it harder for innocent students to win vindication by scaling back the rights promised to accused students reflecting this mindset the national association of college and university attorneys published a may 0 research note urging colleges and universities to “promptly destroy” documents such as “emails … staff notes … notes of hearing participants during a disciplinary hearing drafts of hearing outcome reports and other such working papers” all of which “might actually prove very useful to a plaintiff’s lawyer” in a subsequent lawsuit why does senator kirsten gillibrand dny hate college men   posted at  am by glenn reynolds   time to primary some folks republicans repeal and replace the tea party even when republicans control the white house and both houses of congress liberalism remains the default ideology of the federal government a republican senate could not muster even  votes for the full repeal of obamacare’s taxes and spending six republican senators who had voted for repeal in  when the party was merely pretending it was possible flipped on wednesday rather than deliver five of the six represent states president trump won in november the sixth hails from a state trump lost by less than  points an argument can be made that repealing these parts of obamacare while leaving its regulatory structure largely in place is a bad idea but we are discussing a law that republicans spent seven years campaigning against every gop senator except one either voted for repeal in the past or campaigned on it in a recent election cycle their leader was said to have a “secret plan” to repeal obamacare “root and branch” there was ample time for a contingency plan or even a better approach to replacing the healthcare law no amount of time ever seems to be enough not  inch of ground gained by liberalism is ever ceded without a fight republicans can campaign against those gains they can now tweet about them but when it comes to action republicans can seldom do more than nibble around the edges the slightest retrenchment of a healthcare law that did not even exist a decade ago is portrayed as a mass casualty event repeal and replace some members   posted at  am by glenn reynolds

“russian candidate” impeachment campaign implies that any contact with any russian by anyone with any connection to donald trump was ipso facto treasonous the quality press is doing its valiant best to pursue this story but it is a bit much to claim “collusion” – a secret conspiracy – given that during the election campaign trump very publicly called on the russians to hack and leak hillary clinton’s missing emails and it did not seem especially surprising when the latest target donald trump jr promptly released all his emails to and from the russians to confirm that he did indeed try to help his dad by finding dirt on the other guy as for the other impeachment track underway triggered by the exfbi director james comey’s accusation of attempted obstruction of justice comey’s failure to accuse trump until he was himself fired will make it easier for the republicans who control the house to dismiss an otherwise plausible accusation as a naive error    but another reason is that the major cause of last november’s electoral outcome has remained mostly unexplored even un­discovered that is not due to intellectual laziness but rather reflects the refusal of almost all commentators to contend with the political economy that determined the outcome of the election longterm processes of income redistribution from working people to everyone else nonworking welfare recipients as well as the very rich had been evident for at least two decades    in the dramatic crescendo of the 0 elections that gave trump to the united states and the world very possibly for sixteen years the president’s reelection committee is already hard at work while his daughter ivanka trump is duly apprenticed in the white house that according to my sources she means to occupy as america’s first female president none of the countless campaign reporters and commentators is on record as having noticed the car “affordability” statistics distributed in june 0 via wwwthecarconnectioncom derived from very reliable federal reserve data they depicted the awful predicament of almost half of all american households had journalists studied the numbers and pondered even briefly their implications they could have determined a priori that only two candidates could win the presidential election – sanders and trump – because none of the others even recognized that there was problem if median american households had been impoverished to the point that they could no longer afford a new car    the clinton crowd even more than the candidate herself blamed the lethargy of the tvwatching

place where jews have long been an integral part of society and whose valuable contributions to the culture are immeasurable” “during my research” halperin continued “i came upon roger waters and i couldn’t believe he was singling out israel when there are so many truly egregious violators of human rights in the world why is he going after israel so i began asking people what this guy has against israel to me an attack on israel is an attack against the jewish people” halperin met with psychologists who work with holocaust survivors and their families he described the effect of waters’ floating pig bearing the star of david as “unforgiveable” for survivors comparing it to a scene in his film where a threeyearold palestinian girl is “brainwashed” into believing jews are pigs in

narcissism” so much so that based on the film version of the album it seems as if waters would much prefer to have his father back even if it meant england not entering wwii given the implications of

accused of stealing computers and data systems in february members of congress cut him loose within days leaving imran awan with no supporters five months later except for rep debbie wasserman schultz the weston democrat has not explained in detail why she continued to employ awan until tuesday when she fired him — after he was arrested on bankfraud charges at dulles international airport in virginia attempting to board a flight to pakistan and she has not elaborated on what work awan did for her after he lost access to the house computer network she declined to answer questions about awan in washington on wednesday and her spokesman david damron accompanied her to the house floor while instructing a reporter that wasserman schultz would not take questions about her former employee background wasserman schultz aide arrested trying to leave the country “a senior house democratic aide confirmed awan was still employed by rep debbie wasserman schultz dfla as of tuesday morning but david damron a spokesman for wasserman schultz later said that awan was fired on tuesday” why was he still on the payroll related debbie wasserman schultz tries to distance from staffer who took k

four former house it workers — who were banned from the congressional network — have largely been ignored and they fear the integrity of sensitive highlevel information imran awan and three relatives were colleagues until police banned them from computer networks at the house of representatives after suspicion the brothers accessed congressional computers without permission five capitol hill technology aides told the daily caller news foundation’s investigative group that members of congress have displayed an inexplicable and intense loyalty towards the suspects who police say victimized them the baffled aides wonder if the suspects are blackmailing representatives based on the contents of their emails and files to which they had full access “i don’t know what they have but they have something on someone it’s been months at this point” with no arrests said pat sowers who has managed it for several house offices for  years “something is rotten in denmark” a manager at a techservices company that works with democratic house offices said he approached congressional offices offering their services at onefourth the price of awan and his pakistani brothers but the members declined at the time he couldn’t understand why his offers were rejected but now he suspects the awans exerted some type of leverage over members “there’s no question about it if i was accused of a

presidency to gauge impact go beyond the laws he has signed to the vast authority he wields through departments and agencies that apply the law six months into his presidency donald trump’s detractors portray him as a donothing president with no big wins on issues such as health care taxes and infrastructure that may be true if the benchmark is legislation but that is an incomplete benchmark to gauge a president’s impact you have to go beyond the laws he signs to the vast authority he wields through departments and agencies that apply the law on that score mr trump is on track to do a lot on finance the internet immigration and drugs to name just a few issues trump appointees have begun nudging the economy and the country in a more conservative probusiness direction whether that is good or bad is to a great extent in the eye of the beholder what isn’t debatable is that the imperial presidency after expanding under barack obama remains just as formidable under mr trump in recent weeks headlines have been dominated by the senate’s stopstart efforts to repeal and replace the affordable care act away from this drama mr trump’s labor department moved to undo mr obama’s expansion of eligibility for overtime pay financial regulators dropped efforts to tighten restrictions on banker pay and the interior department signaled it would rescind proposed rules on oil and gas fracking on federal land on wednesday mr trump announced transgender individuals couldn’t serve in the military reversing an obamaera decision in mr trump’s first six months rulemaking has changed dramatically

uncharted territory policymakers and the public are both still playing catchup to this extraordinary transformation for decades the us energy debate was framed in terms of scarcity as the legacy of the arab oil embargo of the s loomed large in american minds we’ve moved far far beyond that as next year’s projected milestone shows into a new era of energy abundance and just as we once
