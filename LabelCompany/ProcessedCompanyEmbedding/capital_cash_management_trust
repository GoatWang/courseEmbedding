product rather than a straightforward bank account so it has a few different characteristics when compared to a cash management account or a savings account it is important that investors be aware of the differences so that they can make informed investment choices when they are deciding where to put their cash investment funds  basically a cash management trust cmt is a managed investment where the funds of individual unit holders are pooled the primary investment is in cash securities the value of each unit does not change it always remains at   a relatively low risk investment product compare this to a cash management account cma  a cma is a bank account which can only be offered by a regulated banking institution earns money market interest on cash balances can also include access via a cheque credit or debit card facility  investors in a cash management trust will have to receive a product disclosure statement pds when they open a trust account and it is worthwhile to read the pds carefully owners of a cash management account should also receive a form of terms and conditions but generally do not have to be provided with a pds wherever you decide to invest your funds some points you may want to consider are return of capital – while these investments have a low risk of capital loss repayment of capital invested in a cmt is not guaranteed withdrawals – because the cmt is a trust the manager can decide to suspend withdrawals when it considers it to be in the best interest of cmt account holders market risk – return on investment is directly affected by changes to the official cash rate as determined by the rba initial deposit – some cmt and cma accounts may request that you deposit a minimum amount upon commencement for example macquarie bank’s cmt requires  initial deposit  ordinary savings accounts typically have no or very low minimum deposit requirements minimum operating balance – some accounts require a minimum amount to remain in the account at all times types of transactions – some cmt accounts may have limitations on the types of transaction that they associate with the account  for example some cmt accounts do not have a cheque or debit card facility fees – some cmt accounts may charge management and ongoing fees interest – usually calculated daily but paid monthly    interest rates – cmt accounts generally offer competitive rates of interest usually better than a savings account most cma accounts offer tiered rates of return depending on account balances underlying investments – the manager of the cmt generally pools the money of individual investors and this is then invested in short dated securities such as government and semigovernment securities bills of exchange negotiable certificates of deposit promissory notes call deposits and other professional money market investments  as such it can be a convenient vehicle for the average investor to gain access to the professional money market instrument risk  ensure an understanding of the instruments held by a cmt manager management  consider whether the trusts management has the appropriate skills and experience to manage the investment it is up to you as an individual investor to decide which type of account will best suit your needs  other resources canstar cannex comparison table of cash management trust interest rates a useful tools section at this

multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards

burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests

begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies
