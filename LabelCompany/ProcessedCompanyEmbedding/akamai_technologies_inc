akamai technologies shares are mainly held by institutional investors the vanguard group blackrock capital group companies and others litigationedit one of akamais patents covers a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network internet web site proprietors content providers contract with akamai to deliver their web sites content to individual internet users the patented method permits large files such as video or music files to be stored on akamais servers and accessed from those servers by internet users this increases the speed with which internet users access the content from web sites unfortunately for akamai its patent was written in a way that called for or permitted actions by multiple persons or entities—such as the content provider customer and the company providing the cdn service akamais competitor limelight chose to operate its allegedly infringing service in that manner—it performed most steps of the patented process and its customers performed a socalled tagging step under the interpretation of patent law at the time when akamai decided to sue limelight for patent infringement a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps the court therefore overturned a  million jury verdict in akamais favor akamai initially lost the case even taking it to the supreme court the supreme court returned the case to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit however with an invitation to reevaluate its rule if it chose to do so that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement on remand the federal circuit considered the matter en banc all active judges of the circuit and modified its rule it now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance on that basis the federal circuit reinstated the  million jury verdict it said that akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that limelight conditions its customers use of its content delivery network upon its customers performance of the steps that limelight does not itself perform this has been considered a substantial change in patent law for

management company based in mountain view ca for an undisclosed allcash amount ownershipedit as of  akamai technologies shares are mainly held by institutional investors the vanguard group blackrock capital group companies and others litigationedit one of akamais patents covers a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network internet web site proprietors content providers contract with akamai to deliver their web sites content to individual internet users the patented method permits large files such as video or music files to be stored on akamais servers and accessed from those servers by internet users this increases the speed with which internet users access the content from web sites unfortunately for akamai its patent was written in a way that called for or permitted actions by multiple persons or entities—such as the content provider customer and the company providing the cdn service akamais competitor limelight chose to operate its allegedly infringing service in that manner—it performed most steps of the patented process and its customers performed a socalled tagging step under the interpretation of patent law at the time when akamai decided to sue limelight for patent infringement a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps the court therefore overturned a  million jury verdict in akamais favor akamai initially lost the case even taking it to the supreme court the supreme court returned the case to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit however with an invitation to reevaluate its rule if it chose to do so that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement on remand the federal circuit considered the matter en banc all active judges of the circuit and modified its rule it now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance on that basis the federal circuit reinstated the  million jury verdict it said that akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that limelight conditions its customers use of its content delivery network upon its customers performance of the steps that limelight does not itself perform this has been considered a substantial change in patent law for further discussion of the case see akamai techs inc v limelight networks inc controversiesedit the national security agency and federal bureau of investigation have reportedly used facebooks akamai content delivery network cdn to collect information on facebook users akamai has been accused of blocking access to web

patented method permits large files such as video or music files to be stored on akamais servers and accessed from those servers by internet users this increases the speed with which internet users access the content from web sites unfortunately for akamai its patent was written in a way that called for or permitted actions by multiple persons or entities—such as the content provider customer and the company providing the cdn service akamais competitor limelight chose to operate its allegedly infringing service in that manner—it performed most steps of the patented process and its customers performed a socalled tagging step under the interpretation of patent law at the time when akamai decided to sue limelight for patent infringement a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps the court therefore overturned a  million jury verdict in akamais favor akamai initially lost the case even taking it to the supreme court the supreme court returned the case to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit however with an invitation to reevaluate its rule if it chose to do so that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement on remand the federal circuit considered the matter en banc all active judges of the circuit and modified its rule it now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance on that basis the federal circuit reinstated the  million jury verdict it said that akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that limelight conditions its customers use of its content delivery network upon its customers performance of the steps that limelight does not itself perform this has been considered a substantial change in patent law for

akamai technologies shares are mainly held by institutional investors the vanguard group blackrock capital group companies and others litigationedit one of akamais patents covers a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network internet web site proprietors content providers contract with akamai to deliver their web sites content to individual internet users the patented method permits large files such as video or music files to be stored on akamais servers and accessed from those servers by internet users this increases the speed with which internet users access the content from web sites unfortunately for akamai its patent was written in a way that called for or permitted actions by multiple persons or entities—such as the content provider customer and the company providing the cdn service akamais competitor limelight chose to operate its allegedly infringing service in that manner—it performed most steps of the patented process and its customers performed a socalled tagging step under the interpretation of patent law at the time when akamai decided to sue limelight for patent infringement a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps the court therefore overturned a  million jury verdict in akamais favor akamai initially lost the case even taking it to the supreme court the supreme court returned the case to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit however with an invitation to reevaluate its rule if it chose to do so that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement on remand the federal circuit considered the matter en banc all active judges of the circuit and modified its rule it now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance on that basis the federal circuit reinstated the  million jury verdict it said that akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that limelight conditions its customers use of its content delivery network upon its customers performance of the steps that limelight does not itself perform this has been considered a substantial change in patent law for

contract with akamai to deliver their web sites content to individual internet users the patented method permits large files such as video or music files to be stored on akamais servers and accessed from those servers by internet users this increases the speed with which internet users access the content from web sites unfortunately for akamai its patent was written in a way that called for or

limelight for patent infringement a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps the court therefore overturned a  million jury verdict in akamais favor akamai initially lost the case even taking it to the supreme court the supreme court returned the case to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit however with an invitation to reevaluate its rule if it chose to do so that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement on remand the federal circuit considered the matter en banc all active judges of the circuit and modified its rule it now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance on that basis the federal circuit reinstated the  million jury verdict it said that akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that limelight conditions its customers use of its content delivery network upon its customers performance of the steps that limelight does not

akamai technologies inc is the global leader in content delivery network cdn services and has been since  when it was incorporated by dr tom leighton and danny lewin the company is a product of the annual mit k entrepreneurship competition of  during which leighton and lewin realized the potential in the internet content delivery market and development efforts began in earnest in  their most notable early achievements include march madness star wars trailers and yahoo named one of the  best places to work by computerworld akamai is the next company featured in the purpose driven workplaces highlight we spoke with noelle faris a principal of investor relations and president of the akamai foundation the charitable arm of the organization to discuss akamai’s corporate giving practices it starts with school cofounder dr tom leighton current ceo of akamai was an mit professor of applied mathematics and his cofounder danny lewin came to mit from the technion to work with leighton as a phd candidate together they focused on creating mathematical algorithms to find a solution to web congestion it was after lewin had already made significant progress on multiple techniques that the two decided to explore the commercial possibilities of their technology by entering the k entrepreneurship competition over the course of the ninemonth competition the hopeful akamai team grew to include a large number of mit students with math computer and business backgrounds noelle faris has been with akamai for eight years her two roles – in investor relations and as president of the akamai foundation – present as she says an interesting dichotomy part of her days likely consist of overseeing shareholder meetings annual reports and private meetings with investors her expansive knowledge of akamai’s earnings makes her an obvious choice to oversee the company’s corporate giving which makes up the other part of her days a  mba graduate from northeastern’s d’amoremckim school of business faris is a big proponent of science technology engineering and mathematics stem education which is the main focus of akamai’s charitable efforts on september   akamai suffered the tragic loss of one of its founders danny lewin one of the ways akamai continues to honor his memory is by focusing their charitable giving on math and science education they do this by offering support to children of all races and backgrounds who have an interest in stem subjects enlightened selfinterest in a video on the akamai foundation’s homepage akamai employees some of the foundation’s partners and a few beneficiaries of akamai’s sponsorship laud the benefits of math education and what akamai has done for the community  many of the employees view it as “enlightened selfinterest” – they are investing in the technologists of the future who will eventually join the same community everyone interviewed expressed their passion for spreading knowledge and information as well as their thanks for the people who helped them along their path to a stem career “paying it forward” is an oftrepeated sentiment stem is part of akamai’s dna the company began at a school and their ceo is a born educator as a member of the stem community many of the employees feel it is their duty and privilege to give back and provide similar opportunities to younger generations because “math isn’t important it’s essential” during the interview faris emphasized that volunteering is ingrained in every employee at the organization – so much so that she considers it a pillar of akamai’s success giving back is a way for the employees to get more involved with both the company and their community most of akamai’s charitable giving is focused in the bostoncambridge area of massachusetts but akamai has over thirty offices around the world and plans to start incorporating a more global givingback strategy they primarily support mathematics education in k for underserved groups like girls children with financially unstable backgrounds and minorities but according to faris being a good corporate citizen is not just about funding and throwing money at issues it’s about time and mentorship akamai wants to inspire young individuals – to be a catalyst taking obstreperous young adults and molding them into budding scientists every employee is offered two fullypaid work days to volunteer their time to a cause of their choosing one of these days can be applied to what the company refers to as danny lewin care days where employees team up with local nonprofit organizations to give back to the community the foundation has many partners and programs they contribute to but this year akamai technologies outside of their foundation teamed up with girls who code for an intensive summer program girlswhocode according to statistics on the girls who code website  of middle school girls express interest in stem subjects however when they are choosing their college majors only  of high school girls end up pursuing computer science akamai teamed up with girls who code for a sevenweek immersion program aimed at teaching young women computer technology skills twenty girls came to the akamai offices every day monday through friday each week had a different computer science focus and akamai technologies covered lunches for the girls every day as well as the cost of bringing in teachers additionally each girl who participated had an akamai employee who volunteered to serve as a mentor to each student dr leighton said it succinctly in akamai’s press release on the girls who code sumer  partnership “the imbalance in the numbers of women focused on careers in computer science software development and internet technologies is one of our industry’s biggest challenges” said dr tom leighton chief executive officer at akamai “partnering with girls who code is an important step towards better preparing young women for technology jobs – an investment we believe that is vital to the future of technology and innovation” their partnership with girls who code as well as all the other projects faris and akamai organize yearly is just one of the many reasons the company has been recognized as one of the top places to work for multiple years akamai is making strides both in business and in philanthropy one child and one employee at a time meaningful work begins here we’ll
