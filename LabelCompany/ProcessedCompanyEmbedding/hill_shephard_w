flock intact protect it from predators and guide it to market areas in time for shearing in ancient times shepherds also commonly milked their sheep and made cheese from this milk few shepherds still do this today in many societies shepherds were an important part of the economy unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others shepherds also lived apart from society being largely nomadic it was mainly a job of solitary males without children and new shepherds thus needed to be recruited externally shepherds were most often the younger sons of farming peasants who did not inherit any land in other societies each family would have a family member to shepherd its flock often a child youth or an elder who couldnt help much with harder work these shepherds were fully integrated in society shepherds would normally work in groups either looking after one large flock or each bringing their own and merging their responsibilities they would live in

areas in the lowlands and river valleys it was far more efficient to grow grain and cereals than to allow sheep to graze thus the raising of sheep was confined to rugged and mountainous areas in

around the world and shepherding became especially important in australia and new zealand where there was great pastoral expansion in australia squatters spread beyond the nineteen counties of new south wales to elsewhere taking over vast holdings called properties and now stations once driven overland to these properties sheep were pastured in large unfenced runs there they required constant supervision shepherds were employed to keep the sheep from straying too far to keep the mobs as healthy as possible and to prevent attacks from dingoes and wedgetailed eagles lambing time further increased the shepherds responsibilities shepherding was an isolated lonely job that was firstly given to assigned convict servants the accommodation was usually poor and the food was lacking in nutrition leading to dysentery and scurvy when free labour was more readily available others took up this occupation some shepherds were additionally brought to australia on the ships that carried sheep and were contracted to caring for them on their arrival in the colony sheep owners complained about the inefficiency of shepherds and the shepherds fears of getting lost in the bush typically sheep were watched by shepherds during the day and by a hutkeeper during the night shepherds took the sheep out to graze before sunrise and returned them to brushtimber yards at sunset the hutkeeper usually slept in a movable shepherds watch box placed near the yard in order to deter attacks on the sheep dogs were also often chained close by to warn of any impending danger to the sheep or

watched by a shepherd by angelica kauffman about  va museum no  traditional midnight mass with shepherds in provence metaphorically the term shepherd is used for god especially in the judeochristian tradition eg psalm  ezekiel  and in christianity especially for jesus who called himself the good shepherd the ancient israelites were a pastoral people and there were many shepherds among them it may also be worth noting that many biblical figures were shepherds among them the patriarchs abraham and jacob the twelve tribes the prophet moses king david and the old testament prophet amos who was a shepherd in the rugged area around tekoa in the new testament angels announced the birth of jesus to shepherds the same metaphor is also applied to priests with roman catholic church of sweden and other lutheran and anglican bishops having the shepherds crook among their insignia see also lycidas in both cases the implication is that the faithful are the flock who have to be tended this is in part inspired by jesuss injunctions to peter feed my sheep which is the source of the pastoral image in lycidas the term pastor originally the latin word for shepherd is now used solely to denote the clergy of most christian denominations the thcentury ravenna mosaic illustrates the concept of the good shepherd the good shepherd is one of the thrusts of biblical scripture this illustration encompasses many ideas including gods care for his people the tendency of humans to put themselves into dangers way and their inability to guide and take care of themselves apart from the direct power and leading of god is also reinforced with the metaphor of sheep in need of a shepherd according to muhammad the prophet of islam every messenger of god had the occupation of being a shepherd at one point in their lives as he himself was as a young man narrated by jabir bin abdullah we were with allah’s apostle picking the fruits of the arak trees and allah’s apostle peace and blessings of allah be to him said “pick the black fruit for it is the best” the companions asked “were you a shepherd” he replied “there was no prophet who was not a shepherd” sahih bukhari chapter ‘prophets’ volume  book  hadith  this includes jesus moses abraham and all other prophets according to islam sikhism also has many mentions of shepherd tales there are many relevant quotations such as we are the cattle god almighty is our shepherd this concept has also been used frequently by critics of organized religion to present an unflattering portrayal see also pashupati dhangar and kuruba in popular cultureedit main articles idyll and pastoralism a shepherdess with her flock by verboeckhoven the shepherd with other such figures as the goatherd is the inhabitant of idealized arcadia which is an idyllic and natural countryside these works are indeed called pastoral after the term for herding the first surviving instances are the idylls of theocritus and the eclogues of virgil both of which inspired many imitators such as edmund spensers the shepheardes calender the shepherds of the pastoral are often heavily conventional and bear little relation to the actual work of shepherds shepherds and shepherdesses have been frequently immortalized in art and sculpture among the best known is the neoclassical danish sculptor bertel thorvaldsens shepherd boy with dogcitation needed in the poem

latin american literary classic empire of dreams yale  by giannina braschi shepherds invade the city of new york in a pastoral revolution the shepherd in such works appears as a virtuous soul because of his living close to nature uncorrupted by the temptations of the city so edmund spenser writes in his colin clouts come home againe of a shepherd who went to the city saw its wickedness and returned home wiser and in the faerie queene makes the shepherds the only people to whom the blatant beast is unknown many tales involving foundlings portray them being rescued by shepherds oedipus romulus and remus the title characters of longuss daphnis and chloe and the winters tale by william shakespeare these characters are often of much higher social status than the characters who save and raise them the shepherds themselves being secondary characters similarly the heroes and heroines of fairy tales written by the précieuses often appeared as shepherds and shepherdesses in pastoral settings but these figures were royal or noble and their simple setting does not cloud their innate nobility in hans christian andersens the shepherdess and the chimney sweep  the porcelain

worth noting that many biblical figures were shepherds among them the patriarchs abraham and jacob the twelve tribes the prophet moses king david and the old testament prophet amos who was a shepherd in the rugged area around tekoa in the new testament angels announced the birth of jesus to shepherds the same metaphor is also applied to priests with roman catholic church of sweden and other lutheran and anglican bishops having the shepherds crook among their insignia see also lycidas in both cases the implication is that the faithful are the flock who have to be tended this is in part inspired by jesuss injunctions to peter feed my sheep which is the source of the pastoral image in lycidas the term pastor originally the latin word for shepherd is now used solely to denote the clergy of most christian denominations the thcentury ravenna mosaic illustrates the concept of the good shepherd the good shepherd is one of the thrusts of biblical scripture this illustration encompasses many ideas including gods care for his people the tendency of humans to put themselves into dangers way and their inability to guide and take care of themselves apart from the direct power

shepherds in the beqaa valley some sheep were integrated in the family farm along with other animals such as chickens and pigs to maintain a large flock the sheep must be able to move from pasture to pasture this required the development of an occupation separate from that of the farmer the duty of shepherds was to keep their flock intact protect it from predators and guide it to market areas in time for shearing in ancient times shepherds also commonly milked their sheep and made cheese from this milk few shepherds still do this today in many societies shepherds were an important part of the economy unlike farmers shepherds were often wage earners being paid to watch the sheep of others shepherds also lived apart from society being largely nomadic it was mainly a job of solitary males without children and new shepherds thus needed to be recruited externally shepherds were most often the younger sons of farming peasants who did not inherit any land in other societies each family would have a family member to shepherd its flock often a child youth or an elder who couldnt help much with harder work these shepherds were fully integrated in society shepherds would normally work in groups either looking after one large flock or each bringing their own and merging their responsibilities they would live in small cabins often shared with their sheep and would buy food from local communities less often shepherds lived in covered wagons that traveled with their flocks shepherding developed only in certain areas in the lowlands and river valleys it was far more efficient to grow

depicted as a partaker of rural paradise and capable of giving things worth more than that a town resident could give  in the latin american literary classic empire of dreams yale  by giannina braschi shepherds invade the city of new york in a pastoral revolution the shepherd in such works appears as a virtuous soul because of his living close to nature uncorrupted by the temptations of the city so edmund spenser writes in his colin clouts come home againe of a shepherd who went to the city saw its wickedness and returned home wiser and in the faerie queene makes the shepherds the only people to whom the blatant beast is unknown many tales involving foundlings portray them being rescued by shepherds oedipus romulus and remus the title characters of longuss daphnis and chloe and the winters tale by william shakespeare these characters are often of much higher social status than the characters who save and raise them the shepherds themselves being secondary characters similarly the heroes and heroines of fairy tales written by the précieuses often appeared as shepherds and shepherdesses in pastoral settings but these figures were royal or noble and their simple setting does not cloud their innate nobility in hans christian andersens the shepherdess and the chimney sweep  the porcelain shepherdess carries a gilt crook and wears shoes of gilt as well her lover is a porcelain chimney sweep with a princely face as fair and rosy as a girls completely unsmudged with soot the shepherd by frederick forsyth is the story of a flight from germany to england undertaken by a young vampire pilot one christmas eve biographies of david bengurion published in the early years of israel emphasized his having been a shepherd immediately after his arrival in the country in the s later however historians concluded that he had been involved only very briefly in this profession and was not good at itcitation needed see alsoedit animal husbandry camel herding dhangar community goatherd herder
