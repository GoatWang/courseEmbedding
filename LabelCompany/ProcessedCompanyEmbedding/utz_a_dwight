first started our company in why is the new creditcard chip technology important to both businesses and their clientsin todays world you hear too many unfortunate stories related to fraudulent activity and identity theft the new emv cards being deployed today will improve payment security by making it more difficult for fraudsters to successfully counterfeit cards unlike traditional magneticstrip cards every time a new emv card is used for payment a unique transaction code is created and cannot be reusedfor merchants and financial institutions the switch to emv will require adding new technology and internal processing systems and compliance with new liability rules consumers will need to activate new cards and learn new payment processes but in the end it should result in greater protections against fraudulent activity also popular on cpbj • retirement campus tests smarthome tools • the whiteboard goodbye gasonly engines  the evolvolution of volvo • harrisburg area
