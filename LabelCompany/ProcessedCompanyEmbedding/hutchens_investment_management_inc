on monday  july  posted in  july hutchens investment management weekly compass july   amazon skews the world “if consumers make better choices the marketplace will change”                                                     mike huckabee   after a brief selloff stocks resumed their upward move with most of the broader averages setting record highs last week  the nasdaq remained  below its june th record after falling  in late juneearly july  this compares with a  downdraft for the sp   the tech sector xlk closed  lower than its record high also set on june th  the turnaround in tech stocks was led by the largecap favorites fang  appl  msft all of which had fallen doubledigits  the selloff resulted in a reawakening of the permabears and the fed watchers while most bullish marketstrategists focus on a shift away from tech into financials  this is a normal rotation away from higherpriced growth stocks to value  large bank earnings thus far justify this strategy as the sp  bank sector kbe has rallied  the after earnings conference calls have not confirmed the longterm earnings optimism as regulation low inflation and a flattening of the yield curve remain  the kbe is up  over the past three months and  above yearago levels  it outdistances the xlk which has risen “only”  yearoveryear  it is important to note that from a trader’s prospective many of the leading tech stocks have not broken above their former highs and therefore remain in a trading range  in our opinion there is little likelihood of a bear market related to an impending recession  the current bull market is in its ninth year and officially one of the longest in history  for many investors the duration of the bull market and the accompanying pe’s substantially above historic norms leave them to constantly reevaluate risk  with the negative media attention investors remain anxious in spite of rising prices  fear that stocks are overpriced results in an instinctive reaction to sell in order to avoid the upcoming swift selloff in the beginning of the bear market  remember bear markets result from economic distortions or euphoria as experienced during the internet bubble in   although some economic imbalances in housing and energy exist today they are manageable    last week amazon held prime day the annual event was for  hours and sales were  above yearago levels  according to data from the consumer intelligence research partners  of amazon’s  million customers in the us have prime  amazon collects  annually for a membership that yields an average of  in annual sales compared to only  for nonmembers  in an attempt to offset potential loss and market share other retailers including walmart and best buy competed with prime day  unlike amazon these “brick and mortar” retailers sell from their own inventory  but amazon in addition to acquiring and selling merchandise on its own offers a service called “fulfillment by amazon” that handles thirdparty sellers  amazon’s success is wellrecognized but our research leads us to believe it is not fully reflected in the retail data published by the census bureau in its monthly retail sales report and utilized as an input for personal consumption expenditures pce and gdp  unfortunately for data consistency amazon only reports net sales however data from the q earnings release shows retail third party sales were up  for yearended q  according to a study done by taxjar in q third party sellers “were generating more than  billion of amazon’s  billion gross merchandise value”  our own unsophisticated survey conducted on prime day showed that the third party fulfillment merchandise was  of all sales  this percentage varies greatly within the various retail categories  amazon tends to sell more of the  and over items with only  being sold by outside suppliers  since amazon does not report gross merchandise sales in its financials where then does the census bureau get their numbers  even if amazon reports sales it would be for amazon itself and not the tens of thousands of third party suppliers fulfillment is another income category  as the number one or two retailer for most categories books clothing electronics and furniture if unrecorded the absence of these sales are significant    according to morgan stanley amazon accounted for  of the growth in q retail sales  data reported by the census bureau are from a probability sample of  employer firms selected from the monthly retail trade survey all the monthly data are benchmarked to a larger annual survey for the previous year  aside from sampling error nonsampling error can occur for “insufficient coverage for retail business”  the census bureau claims the retail sales report includes sales from pureplay ecommerce and retailers but third party suppliers could easily fall between the definitional cracks  it has been our contention that these sales may be uncollected and therefore absent from consumer purchases  healthy consumer balance sheets full employment low gas prices and the level of consumer sentiment do not justify pce for gdp at an historically low   as consumers continue to get more for their money the  real gdp growth does not justify  increase in quarterly earnings  we will carefully monitor for an increase in the july retail sales report to see if prime day significantly moves the needle   a vibrant consumer seems to be lost in the data which does not reflect the rapidly changing demographic and the seismic shift in retail  as we have stated the gross output is a better indication of economic activity rather than final sales compass   corporate earnings are more reflective of gross output as it takes into account all goods and services used in the production process including intermediate production rather than final consumption  in this measurement pce is only about  investment policy our investment policy remains optimistic we do not discount the possibility of a market sell off as investors become frustrated with slow implementation of stimulative policies however any correction should be considered a longterm buying opportunity  it is unlikely given the growing strength in the economy and the outlook for corporate earnings that the longterm bull market will be interrupted  realistically the positives from expansionary fiscal policies will take more time than generally expected longer term we believe that consumerled economic growth accompanied by slow rising real interest rates and moderate inflation will result in increased earnings and multiple expansion with further upside for select domestic largecap consumer financial industrial and technology companies  to mitigate the potential of higherthanexpected inflation and multiple compression
