turn the call over to dr douglas fambrough dicernas chief executive officer douglas fambrough thank you peter good afternoon and thanks to all of you who have dialed in to the call today joining me to present on the call is jim dentzer our chief financial officer we are pleased to be able to provide you with this first quarter update dicerna continues to make positive progress on key clinical objectives for our development programs for twokey product candidates dcrph our program for primary hyperoxaluria type  or ph which is a rare inherited liver metabolic disorder and dcrmyc our oncology program targeting the myc oncogene in addition we continue to make positive progress on our extended dicer substrate platform demonstrating effective gene silencing with subcutaneously administered dsirnaex conjugate molecules which are the basis of our earlierstage liver targeted programs as a reminder dicerna is a rna interference or rnaibased biopharmaceutical company focused on treating specific indications in rare inherited diseases involving the liver and genetically defined oncology targets using dicernas proprietary rnai molecules known as dicer substrates or dsirnas were pursuing targets that have historically been difficult to inhibit using conventional pharmaceutical approaches but are accessible by rnai where connections between those targets and diseases are well understood and documented we seek to retain substantial commercial rights to our key programs to discuss our progress in more detail id like to begin with our dsirnaex conjugate technology that enables subcutaneous delivery to the liver these conjugates do not involve lipid nanoparticles and are built on our dsirnaex technology using an extension to one end of the doublestranded dsirna molecule as you may recall from our rd update in december  we showed greater than  gene knockdown after a single subcutaneous administration in mice with potency such that we can achieve  gene knockdown with only  milligrams of dsirnaex conjugate per kilogram of body weight recently at the th annual tides conference we provided additional data on our dsirnaex conjugate technology extending our observations to nonhuman primates and the work presented at tides we showed that we can achieve greater than  gene knockdown with  milligrams of dsirnaex conjugate per kilogram body weight demonstrating effective translation of the dsirnaex conjugate technology from rodents to primates in addition the nadir level of transcript knockdown was observed to continue beyond one month after a single dose showing a very long duration of effect we believe these results are supportive of clinical application of the dsirnaex conjugate technology to that end we are utilizing dsirnaex conjugates in our tobeannounced liver programs including novel rare disease and have dsirnaex conjugates in optimization against four additional liver targets with more programs planned i would like to turn next to our dcrph program for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type  ph is a rare disease where an error in liver metabolism causes patients to have high levels of oxalate in the urine resulting in progressive and severe damage to the kidneys existing disease management practices for ph may slow but do not stop disease progression and most patients eventually experience complete kidney failure with the median age of kidney failure being in the early s aside from dual liverkidney transplant there are no effective treatments and no fda approved therapies for most patients with ph two aspects of ph make it particularly attractive as a program for dicerna first ph is a natural application of dicernas technology based on the clear genetic basis of the disease and the fact that the disease metabolism seems to occur exclusively or nearly exclusively in the liver second ph presents clear and easily assayed biomarkers urinary oxalate and glycolate levels and these markers provide a direct readout of the mechanism of pathology in ph as weve discussed before we have generated highly encouraging data in the main animal model of primary hyperoxaluria type  in this model mice have been genetically engineered to carry the same metabolic defect found in ph patients these mice have elevated levels of urinary oxalate roughly three times the normal background levels that level of elevation is similar to the elevated levels commonly observed in patients with ph using our dcrph product candidate to knockdown the targeted hao gene transcript in these mice at doses of  milligrams per kilogram bodyweight we saw reductions in urinary oxalate levels to background or near background levels we believe that similar results if observed in patients with ph would have a significant beneficial impact on disease progression in normal nonhuman primates we have shown that a single dose of dcrph at  milligrams per kilogram bodyweight leads to an average of  gene knockdown with up to  knockdown observed four days after dosing  days after a single  milligram per kilogram dose in nonhuman primates we see an average or  gene target knockdown with up to  knockdown observed as previously disclosed we are initiating a natural history study of ph this study will enroll  to  patients with genetically confirmed diagnosis of ph excluding patients on dialysis the objectives of the study are to characterize the natural history of ph estimate changes in oxalate and glycolate levels and renal function over time among others we believe this information will provide a historical group for comparison to data from clinical trials and will facilitate the clinical development of dcrph in an important regulatory milestone we announced last month that the us food and drug administration has granted orphan drug designation to dcrph for the treatment of ph dicerna continues to advance the dcrph program per our internal timeline with an ind filing in the third quarter and clinical initiation in the fourth quarter studies in nonhuman primates have refined our expectations for data readout from the trial observations in nonhuman primates have demonstrated two important points that affect our timeline expectations first we have seen substantially longer target enzyme halflife in nonhuman primates compared to mice and thus movement in key metabolite biomarkers takes longer to be observed and second greater levels of rnai knockdown are required for enzyme silencing in nonhuman primates compared with mice which suggests that we may need to achieve high levels of the gene knockdown in ph patients before observing biomarker movement these phenomena combined suggest that we may need to go to higher dose cohorts before observing robust biomarker response during the phase  trial we therefore expect this data to emerge in the first half of  id now like to turn to our second product candidate dcrmyc which is our dsirnabased therapeutic targeting the myc oncogene formulated in our tumorcentric on core lipid nanoparticle formulation dcrmyc is currently being tested in two ongoing clinical trials dicerna selected myc as a highpriority target to silence with our dsirna technology because it is frequently amplified or otherwise upregulated in a wide variety of tumor types because myc is a protein which lacks the good small molecular binding site it has been a challenging target for small molecule therapy and has been an elusive target for drug developers for decades we believe our dicer substrate rnai platform overcomes this limitation because we dont target the protein rather we target the rna transcript our preclinical data for dcrmyc demonstrate specific and significant myc gene knockdown in multiple tumorbearing mouse models dcrmyc entered phase  clinical testing in april of  in patients with solid tumors multiple myeloma or lymphoma the phase  trial endpoints include safety and tolerability and well identify the maximum tolerated dose pharmacokinetic profile pharmacodynamic effects and antitumor activity of dcrmyc we are evaluating antitumor activity by resist using conventional imaging techniques such as ct and mri in addition we have incorporated fdgpet imaging in the study as fdg uptake by tumors may serve as a useful biomarker of myc activity reductions in myc activity are predicted to cause a decrease in tumor metabolic rate which can be visualized by imaging glucose uptake using the fdgpet imaging technology fdgpet is also a marker of early detection of response across several tumor types once we have achieved the maximum tolerated dose in the study we will be taking biopsies from patient tumors in which we will seek to identify the direct products of rnai cleavage of the myc transcript we hope to establish proof of concept for dcrmyc by showing resist responses in patients in conjunction with reduced fdg uptake and demonstration of rnai activity against the myc transcript we continue to expect a readout from this phase  trial by the end of  contingent upon achieving proof of concept with dcrmyc we will launch our second oncology program targeting betacatenin into indenabling studies we are pleased with the progress of the dcrmyc trial so far including our patient enrollment rate we have escalated through several dose levels and were continuing with the dose escalation process we have not identified a maximum tolerated dose preliminary results from early dose cohorts of the trial will be discussed in an oral presentation at the upcoming asco conference as we have not identified a maximum tolerated dose and thus are not taking biopsies this presentation will not include the molecular data on rnai activity in the december  we initiated a second clinical study of dcrmyc a phase b study in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or hcc who have either failed sorafenib or are intolerant to sorafenib or who dont have access to other therapies for hcc the first patient in this study was dosed in january  we selected hcc as an initial focus indication for dcrmyc both due to the observation that the myc gene is frequently amplified in hcc patients and due to the commercial and competitive profile of the hcc market hcc is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide patients with advanced hcc had limited treatments options and there are now approved therapies for those who do not respond or do not tolerate standard of care treatment with sorafenib we have sites for the hcc clinical trial both in the us and in asia due to the high prevalence of this disease in the asian population now i will turn over the call to our chief financial officer james dentzer for an update on our financial progress jim james dentzer thank you doug as many of you have seen we filed our q today there was a great deal of detail contained in that document i would like to focus on the main financial metrics that we believe are important to use when evaluating the efficiency of our business in the first quarter of  dicerna had a net loss of  million compared to a net loss of  million for the same period in  research and development expenses were  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the same period in  the increase was primarily due to the initiation of clinical trials related to dcrmyc an increase in research activities related to dcrph and increased employeerelated expenses partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation of  million general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of  totaled  million compared to  million for the same period in  the increase was primarily from the increased costs of operating as a public company and an increase in payrollrelated expenses which includes an increase in stockbased compensation of  million as of march   the company had  million in cash and cash equivalents and held to maturity investments as compared to  million in cash and cash equivalent and held to maturity investments as of december   based on our current position and operating plan the company reiterates its expectations that it has sufficient cash to fund operations through the end of  this estimate assumes no additional partnership funding and no new debt or equity financings more detailed financial information and analysis maybe found in the companys annual report and its quarterly report on form q filed today with the sec with that i will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from michael schmidt of leerink michael schmidt so im trying to understand your statement around the dcrph pkpd relationship between mouse and nonhuman primates and i guess based on that what level knockdown do you believe you need to achieve in humans to achieve an effective biomarkers in your view douglas fambrough sure so its difficult to predict across species but what i can do is give a little more clarity on the knockdown from a nonhuman primates and knockdown from the mouse model so with  gene knockdown in the mouse model we found that we could start to see movement in the biomarkers and in order to see movement on the biomarkers in the nonhuman primates you need to go to  or so before wed see that moving and get up towards  to see the really strong movement so our expectations for the amount of knockdown that we need to see in humans we track along side the nonhuman primates and that would suggest that the doses that were likely to start at in the phase  trial which might have hit the  threshold may not hit the  to  threshold and we may need to go deeper in those escalation before the biomarkers move is that helpful michael michael schmidt yes and so youre talking  to  transcript knockdown or protein level knockdown douglas fambrough were talking transcript knockdown now we will not be collecting biopsies from the livers of patients in the phase  trial so we will not get data on the transcript knockdown from patients michael schmidt and i guess dosing frequency is that another variable that could affect those parameters douglas fambrough in the longterm which is to say going to a multiple dose chronic treatment i dont think its going to have a very major effect because of the duration of effective rnai in primates if what matters is driving to therapeutic threshold levels and then i think the kind of duration which we have been hoping to achieve well call that a minimum of  weeks but a target of once monthly i think thats very achievable to stay below even a higher threshold with the monthly dosing interval so at this point not thinking about any increased frequency required in the longterm michael schmidt and then i had a question on the recent tides presentation so you included some data of a galnac conjugate formulated oligotargeting hao and i was wondering a if you had any plans for a subcutaneous formulated product for this indication along the term and number two the potency that youve observed with the subcutaneously administered product in nonhuman primates i guess how does that compare to other gene knockdown technologies douglas fambrough so we have pursued our dsirnaexconjugate technology against the hao gene which gives us the option of continuing through a formal development program to produce a subcutaneous inhibitor and at this point we have not committed to such a development program but we have the option to do so and may do so in the future with respect to the potency of the dsirnaexconjugate technology i think that compares very comparably to the data that is been presented by competitors somewhere if you take down myeloma as a specific competitor the technology appears to have a potency and a duration of action that looks more like what they would describe their esc technology than it does what they describe is their standard chemistry which was incorporated in the ttrsc program so i think in a more general statement one would say we feel the potency that we have achieved and demonstrated through the ic results both in mice and nonhuman primates demonstrates a competitive potency profile such that it would lead to a competitive product profile as well michael schmidt and then maybe back to the ph program are the metabolic pathways how conserved are those between mice nonhumans primates and humans douglas fambrough to the best of knowledge the pathways are well conserved one needs to recognize that this is not the most heavily researched part of human physiology that said the pathway is part of a common metabolic breakdown pathway than any vertebrate animal has as part of its metabolic repertoire the primary role of the pathway is detoxification of hydroxyproline which is about  by collagen by weight and looking across genomic information you see conservation of the relevant enzymes in the pathway if you look at gene expression databases you see that there is a general conservation of the special distribution of expression as well which is to say that the pathway is active in the liver those surveys do not have cellular resolution but as far as we have observed in the mice its just hepatocyte activity given the common biochemical problem and the conservation of the enzymes both with respect to sequence identity and level of expression at the organ level i think its very likely that the pathway is very conserved it is worth mentioning though that this pathway is not the only source of oxalate and there do appear to be differences between rodents and primates with respect to other sources of oxalate specifically regarding differences in vitamin c metabolism these differences are predicted to result in a higher background level of oxalate in the rodents compared to primates as is observed we do not believe this will impact the therapeutic activity of the product it is relevant to comparing baseline oxalate levels but not to thinking about the dynamics of oxalate production through this pathway and it is this specific pathway which is impacted in primary hyperoxaluria type  thus in conclusion to the best understanding of the pathway today we would predict good conservation and in our observations to nonhuman primates to date including data that we have not presented such as elevations in urinary glycolate in nonhuman primates after treatment with dcrph we remain optimistic that the therapeutic mechanism will translate very nicely from the mouse model of disease to patient michael schmidt and are you planning to present more nonhuman primate data at some point in the near future on some of those findings douglas fambrough not in the near future but we would expect to have substantial presentation at the next ph focus meeting operator and our next question comes from stephen willey of stifel stephen willey can you just remind us whats the magnitude in terms of the directional movement and enzymatic biomarkers that you need to see in order to recapitulate the phenotype in the rodent model and i guess when you talk about  knockdown as being initiating of that movement of the biomarker movement that translates into an approximate what level of reduction in terms of the markers themselves douglas fambrough so this is an interesting question to answer in oneonone meetings i frequently make the comment that i dont think talking about percent reduction is really the right way to do it even though thats the way the field has traditionally done it so let me start by just giving some facts about oxalate in the disease and in normal individuals normal oxalate is standardly written as less than  of the units that are used millimoles per body surface area per day the median oxalate in ph patient is  so roughly four times the background at the th percentile theyre up at  now in the field physicians talk about  reduction in oxalate as being what is really clinically interesting so i think the way to think about that is a  reduction from the median now let me take this in a slightly different direction there is a welldocumented correlation between oxalate level in the urine and longterm kidney outcome and the way that data has been presented i dont have access to all the background data that went into it the way that date has been presented it oxalate is below  than the risk of kidney failure over a decadal scale reduces to near zero so i think its more appropriate to think of  as a threshold level that we want to achieve and if you do the math  reduction from  and  thats a same place the amount of reduction that we see in the mouse model is on the order of  or so pick the time data point that you want to measure so substantially more than what the field is looking for that encourages us that even if there are some differences between species that dcrph and this mechanism of action has the capability to exceed a  reduction and to lower oxalate levels below the  level that one might use as a threshold for a significant therapeutic effect stephen willey so we should think about then i guess your dose escalation efforts then really being targeted towards that  number as oppose to kind of a threshold percentage reduction douglas fambrough im hesitating and agreeing with that because clinical trials historically in this indication have used percent reduction and whether we continue to use percent reduction as a clinical endpoint or whether in conjunction with the fda we define a threshold thats a decision that will be made in the future i think its useful to make sure that people understand that in the phase  trial patients may have some body burden of oxalate crystals that will dissolve and contribute to oxalate in the urine which could buffer the reduction of oxalate that we observed in a single dose trial we do expect to see realtime elevations in glycolate and we suggest that people look at both of those biomarkers and we very much do expect to see oxalate reductions but if we have a major reduction in oxalate production in the liver you may see some additional solubilization of existing oxalate crystals the enrollment criteria for the phase  well attempt to select patients that do not have a lot of oxalate burden already for later stage trials well take probably all patients and well include enough time to washout existing oxalate levels stephen willey and then just a question on pcr mix so i think you had indicated that there wont be any biopsy data at asco so any i guess rnai mediated ontarget efficacy wont be necessarily part of the presentation but im guessing and because this is an allcomers trial that you are probably getting some patients with some baseline tumor types that are probably easier to access from a biopsy perspective than others and so should we just be thinking about this data just coming at a later time point douglas fambrough yes and we continue to guide to the yearend for us to have what i think will be a meaningful dataset patients add mtd maybe some from prior mtd as well if we ask them for biopsy as well as the biomarker data and the resist data such that by yearend hopefully well be able to make a statement about proofofconcept one way or the other operator our next question comes from the line of chris raymond of robert w baird laura chico this is laura chico in for chris raymond i think a couple my questions have already been asked but id just like to circle back on ph a little bit if i might and apologies if i missed this have you discussed kind of what the doselimiting toxicity is in the mice or kind of how high youve been able to dose thus far douglas fambrough we have not discussed any of that information however the deliver system that is employed in dcrph is in license from tekmira pharmaceuticals and this formulation was used in their ebolatargeted program where they have released a fair amount of data on the toxicological findings with respect to that program that i think are a direct read over onto dcrph notably in a healthy volunteer study they were able to dose through  milligrams per kilograms without any premedication and not have tolerability issues in the patients this is a remarkable level of tolerability for a lipid nanoparticle program essentially all lipidbased drugs that are use today are used in conjunction with premedications to suppress infusion reaction so based on human experience with this formulation the infusion reaction issue appears to be minimized compared to all of their lipid products for this formulation we do expect that a dose limiting that the tolerability issues that would limit dose would be related to infusion reaction laura chico i guess related to ph and the natural history study do you plan posting that on clinicaltrialsgov douglas fambrough laura i dont know the answer to that question its a noninterventional study so im not certain its required we will do it if required i suspect if its not required we wont but in fact its got to be a nonanswer laura i dont actually know laura chico i guess one last kind of highlevel question as youre thinking about the two platforms oncology versus livertargeted diseases i wonder if you could opine a little bit or talk about how youre prioritizing your efforts in allocating resources between the two different franchises douglas fambrough theres a really clear answer to that laura at this point there is great validation in the rnai field for delivery to hepatocytes and that gives us the confidence to invest heavily in building out the hepatocyte or liver targeted pipeline and so almost all of our internal resources are dedicated to creating additional pipeline programs for hepatocytes targets as well as supporting the dcrph program the resources in oncology are best seen as being on hold we have done i think an excellent job to creating a critical candidate with dcrmyc that very effectively has mediated delivery to xenograft models both orthotopically implanted and subcutaneous to genetically engineered mouse model and has more recently been shown in pdx style models that said those are all mouse models and the translation of delivery in tumors and mice to tumors and patients is one where we do not understand the differences and challenges so while we evaluate how that translation proceeds in the dcrmyc phase  trial we have put the allocation of resources to oncology more or less on hold we have developed a second clinical candidate thats for betacatenin and its essentially in a holding pattern prior to ind enabling studies if and when we achieve the proofofconcept with the dcrmyc and i described in the call today that proofofconcept has three aspects to it molecular evidence of knockdown of the myc transcript biomarker movement in reduce glucose uptake as seen by fdgpet and resist responses if we see a set of patients where we can link those three things together or connect the dots as i say then dicerna will be satisfied that we have achieved proofofconcept and with that we would freeup resources to move forward betacatenin and likely invest resources in additional oncology products as well but until that time and i hope that time is soon but its not yet until that time our resource allocation is dedicated to building out the wide variety of targeted program opportunities that our liver targeted its also worth mentioning that all of our programs beyond ph for liver targets will incorporate the dsirnaex conjugate technology for subcutaneous administration laura chico and i guess just one last quick one and ill hop back in the queue i think i heard you say that you will not be collecting liver biopsies in the phase  ph trial did i hear that correctly and talk a little about the rationale for not getting the transcript data douglas fambrough so you did hear that correctly and the rationale is really twofold one is that its really a big ask to poke someone in the liver and get a biopsy there is risk associated with the procedure like that in addition to it being uncomfortable the second is that while the transcript knockdown information is interesting with respect to disease outcome its really neither here nor there what we need to see in order to have an effective therapy is reduction in urinary oxalate an evidence that were stopping the pathway by an increasing urinary glycolate absenting movement in the biomarkers it really doesnt matter what level of gene transcript reductions that we see so i consider it nonessential information in the trial so for those reasons i dont think that its appropriate for us to ask the patients to undergo the procedure and i think its conceivable that irbs wouldnt tolerate it anyway in any event were not making the ask operator and at this time i am showing there are no further participants in the queue i would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks end of qa douglas fambrough i want to thank everyone for their attention today this is a very exciting time for dicerna as we get towards the later half of  and begin to get into the clinic for dcrph as well as seeing more data out of the dcrmyc clinical trial so thank you all for your attention today operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation on todays conference this concludes the

fambrough dicerna’s president and chief executive officer douglas fambrough thank you melody good afternoon and thanks to all of you who have joined today’s call today with me is jack green our chief financial officer and bob brown our chief scientific officer without a doubt the third quarter of  was a transformative one for dicerna having formally rolled out our galxc technology platform in the second quarter as a fully optimized and enabled drug discovery engine we announced in late september our strategic plan to focus our resources squarely on leveraging galxc’s potential our goal is to advance development of innovative subcutaneously delivered rna interference or rnai based pharmaceutical candidates for diseases involving the liver such as rare diseases chronic liver diseases cardiovascular diseases and viral infectious diseases given the potential power of the galxc platform that could provide potency on par with or better than comparable platforms as well as key benefits including subcutaneous injectable administration infrequent dosing such as monthly quarterly and potentially even less often than that high therapeutic index and specificity to a single target gene each of which has been previously demonstrated with galxc compounds and silencing more than  different disease targets in animal models including now more than six demonstrations in nonhuman primates given all of these qualities of the galxc platform we are confident in our ability to develop a broad pipeline of galxc product candidates with tremendous commercial prospects so as we transition away from our legacy programs that utilized to lipid nanoparticlebased delivery system it bears repeating our firm belief that leveraging our proprietary galxc platform will allow us to retain a full or substantial ownership stake while continuing to invest internally in indications with defined patient populations such as certain rare diseases which we think offer the highest probabilities of both development and commercial success with respect to our complex diseases with multiple gene dysfunctions and larger patient populations we remain in active discussions with various potential partners regarding galxc programs in these broader therapeutic areas the research data we have generated todate has attracted a number of interested parties and we will continue our due diligence with each as appropriate in order to find the right partner that can provide the enhanced scale resources and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects as i stated on the last call dicerna intends to initiate a total of three galxc development programs this year and we are on track to achieve this goal moreover at our current capacity we can initiate three additional development programs on an annual basis going forward as we previously reported in addition to strong efficacy and duration profiles in animal models galxc has also shown a very clean safety profile which is an important point that i want to reiterate as you may recall using exaggerated pharmacology in other words very high doses which were many multiples higher than the expected clinical dose and given more frequently than normal we saw zero serious adverse events including no evidence of liver kidney or injection site toxicity in animal studies this is truly exciting to see and only adds to our confidence level as a result we believe that the path is clear for us to use galxc to exploit the deep well of opportunity for rnaibased therapies directed towards the liver and this process is well underway as many of you know we have been actively examining potential disease associated targets across multiple therapeutic areas of interest our ability to rapidly generate galxc inhibitors in rodents often in as little less  days has allowed us to quickly validate potential disease targets as of today we have now qualified over  disease associated target genes in our stated areas of focus where we believe an rnaibased inhibitor may provide substantial patient benefit let me now take the opportunity to review our current development programs the first of our  preclinical programs which was launched earlier this year is dcrphxc for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria or ph as you may recall ph is a rare inborn error of metabolism in which the liver produces excessive levels of oxalate which results in lifethreatening damage to the kidneys and other key body tissues unfortunately the current standard of care cannot stop disease progression and as a result short of a combined liver kidney transplant the majority of patients face complete renal failure by their early s there is an urgency of therapeutic need for this patient population and we are confident that the dcrphxc program will benefit from our prior experience with dcrph a lipid nanoparticlebased and iv administered program which as you know we have now discontinued and transitioned over to our galxcbased compound the final decision to transition our ph program to dcrphxc and to discontinue dcrph was made after taking several factors into account first the dcr human proofofconcept data which showed the pharmacological activity of rnaibased therapy in ph and normal healthy volunteers and which we presented at the international pediatric nephrology association congress in late september second the utility of the subcutaneous galxc platform as i’ve already discussed and finally the totality of our encouraging dcrphxc preclinical data which showed that dcrphxc was able to more effectively normalize oxalate production and ameliorate the disease condition of hyperoxaluria together these factors convinced us that dcrphxc has the potential to be a better not just as good but a better therapeutic candidate for this underserved patient population i want to thank all of the patients their families and clinical investigators involved in the dcrph trials for their invaluable contributions we will apply all of the lessons learned from those trials to the development of dcrphxc as we advance the program let me also note that in line with our commitment to the ph community we will continue to advance our primary hyperoxaluria observational study called phyos which is collecting data on key biochemical parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of ph which has now enrolled a total of  patients we hope to leverage this data to better understand the baseline ph disease state which will help guide our longterm development plans for dcrphxc with all of that said our preclinical work in this program is ongoing and on track and we intend to file an ind or cta for dcrphxc in late  and commence human clinical trials shortly thereafter moving on to additional galxc programs our second  galxc program will target the pcsk for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia a disease which is characterized by abnormally high blood serum levels of lowdensity lipoproteins and which is one of the key known risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease our galxc pcsk program is being developed for the potentially multibillion dollar statinrefractory cardiovascular disease market with a goal of improved convenience and adherence to therapy compared to monoclonal antibodies driven by less frequent and smaller volume dosing pcsk is already a validated target for this condition and two fda approved therapies currently in use that are based on monoclonal antibody technology in contrast to these based on preclinical studies we believe that the galxc platform has the potential to produce a pcsk targeted therapy with more attractive commercial properties including comparatively smaller subcutaneous injection volumes and less frequent dosing while providing equal or superior control of serum cholesterol we are continuing to advance this program and are on track to nominate a candidate for preclinical development by the end of the year as the hypercholesterolemia market encompasses a larger patient population and in keeping with our stated strategy our end goal will be to partner out this particular program at a stage where terms of a collaborative deal fairly reflects the assets value to dicerna and its shareholders we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress for competitive reasons we are not yet disclosing our third  galxcbased therapeutic program although i can’t say that it targets a liver express gene which is involved in another serious rare disease with high morbidity and mortality we have selected this disease and target gene based on a strong therapeutic hypothesis availability of a potentially predictive biomarker high unmet medical need favorable competitive positioning and what we believe may be a rapid projected path to approval the program is on track for formal launch with an optimized lead candidate also by year end concurrent with this activity we are busy using our galxc platform to proactively evaluate a series of additional target genes in multiple disease states across our core therapeutic areas and expect to formally initiate three additional preclinical programs in  including one for chronic hepatitis b virus and two additional programs from our core therapeutic areas as we stated in september we aim to have a total of five programs in the clinic by the end of  lastly as our focus has shifted and as previously announced we have discontinued our dcrmyc program in oncology indications although clinical response and molecular knockdown was observed in preliminary data from the dcrmyc trial the early efficacy results unfortunately did not warrant further development it is worth noting however that paired tumor biopsies pre and posttreatment showed in all cases clear evidence of rnaimediated myc messenger rna destruction in tumors from all patients tested indicating that successful drug delivery had occurred the likely in insufficient amounts data from these studies were presented at the oligonucleotide therapeutics society conference on september   as i hope you can tell we are more enthusiastic than ever about the power of the galxc platform and believe strongly that our newly stated strategy will ultimately result in a range of highly targeted highly effective rnai therapies with tangible benefits that address important and urgent unmet medical needs as i have stated before rnai provides the potential to develop therapies that act by a wellunderstood yet previously on druggable mechanisms and which require less onerous dosing regimens which we believe can significantly improve patient compliance and health outcomes i will now turn the call over to our chief financial officer jack green for an update on our financial progress jack jack green thanks doug i’d like to briefly summarize the key financial results for the quarter ended september   and direct you to our q filing for additional details in the third quarter of  the company had a net loss of  million or  per share compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the same period of  research and development expenses were  million for the third quarter of  compared to  million for the same period of  the yeartoyear decrease was primarily due to a reduction in manufacturing and toxicology testing activities and a decrease in discovery and early development costs as programs advanced yearoveryear into clinical testing these decreases were partially offset by an overall increase in preclinical studies for our galxc platform as well as an increase in clinical trial activities as we noted in the release employeerelated expenses facilities depreciation and other expenses have remained consistent yeartoyear general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of  totaled  million as compared to  million in the same period in  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stockbased compensation expense and a reduction in other general and administrative expenses we expect ga expenses to increase in the future as the company continues to expand its operating activities and incurs additional costs associated with being a public – publicly traded company as of september   we had  million in cash cash equivalents and heldtomaturity investments as compared to  million as of december   in addition we also had  million of restricted cash on the balance sheet which reflects collaterals securing our facility lease obligations in the third quarter of  we used  million of cash in operations finally based on our current cash position and operating plan we continue to expect that we will have sufficient cash to fund planned operations for at least the next  months excluding any additional partnership funding debt or equity financings more detail of the financial information and analysis may be found in the company’s quarterly report on form q filed with – filed today with the sec i’d like now to turn the call back over to doug douglas fambrough thank you jack and before i turn the call over to questions i would like to reiterate how committed we are to our focus on exploiting the full potential of our proprietary galxc platform which we firmly believe holds the promise of allowing us to build an exceptionally valuable pipeline over the coming years we remain on track to finalize the launch of two more galxc development programs this year as well as to identify our programs for  and beyond we’ve also generated interest in our large patient population programs from potential strategic collaborators and we will continue to pursue those opportunities i want to thank you for your continued interest in dicerna and for your attendance on today’s call with that we will now open the call to your questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of stephen willey with stifel your line is now open stephen willey yes hi thanks for taking the questions i was just maybe wondering doug if you can comment a little bit around i guess how some of the i guess the safety concerns that have emerged with competitor programs may or may not have impacted the pace of ongoing strategic discussions douglas fambrough sure i was about to say i can’t comment on other company’s data but that’s not really your question we’ve been very pleased to observe that this has generated very little concern on the part of the parties that we’re in discussions with to speculate a little bit i think the lack of any specific safety signal associated with death in balance ph that was reported by a peer company significantly influences that but there’s although there is a death in balance or sort of there are to sink your teeth into as you know the dosing paradigm of that compound involved very highlevel of drug large complex pollyanna indiscernible that is more than an order of magnitude substantially more than an order of magnitude higher than the dosing levels that we anticipate and which are predictable from our nonhuman primate data both the amount of material and the frequency being substantially higher so in short we have not had any impact in a negative way on our discussions with respect to pace or their trajectory stephen willey that’s helpful thanks for providing them and then with respect to the ongoing phyos study the observational study in ph how many of those patients that are currently enrolled in the study do you think will subsequently i guess serve as a reservoir for some of the phase  development work that you’re hoping to do with phxc douglas fambrough i don’t think it’s possible to put a number on that we will continue to enroll ph patients in phyos and as you know there is at least one other program from a competitor a company that will be enrolling in the space it’s certainly possible for patients and phyos to enroll in a competitor trial however one of the goals of phyos as you’re pointing out was to serve as a reservoir for us and with the continued enrollment phyos believe it will continue to serve that role when we reenter the clinic with the dcrphxc program but i don’t think i’m in a position to quantify that stephen willey okay thanks for taking the questions operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of michael schmidt with leerink partners your line is now open varun kumar hi this is varun kumar on behalf of michael schmidt my first question is on hbv program like the recent clinical data from other rnai companies have been mixed in terms of viral antigen detection rnai can you please elaborate more on your strategy for hepatitis b program and if you are thinking to do some preclinical work combining rnai platform with some other agents or potential synergy douglas fambrough it’s still pretty early days for understanding the role that rnai will have in the treatment of chronic hbv and some of the early clinical work that’s occurred in the field has educated i think everyone in the field about how to target that virus and i can tell you we have paid acute attention to that work and incorporated the lessons from it in our program with respect to the specific question about combination studies we are an rnai company so we do not have potential combination of products that are in development here but i anticipate that from a class level we will look at the way combinations play out but i think from a very simple perspective one can look at a viral disease like hbv and an analogy to other chronic viruses you would expect combination therapy in that context you could use other molecules and face the full force of the virus or you could do it in combination with rnai and attenuate the virus by based on our current data at least three logs and it – it’s pretty likely that that will work better attenuated by three logs so i think independent of the exact combinations that will ultimately be determined really in clinical testing in patients the idea that there be a role for rnai i think very easily supported so it’s really on that basis that we are working at this point primarily to optimize the activity the rnai component itself and we’ll have to see how things evolve i don’t think it’s fully predictable right now varun kumar okay thank you and just the last question so we’ve seen a recent set back in ttr space from peer companies how are you thinking about the ttr indication specifically the opportunity in cardiomyopathy patient does that – does it change your strategy for the ttr indication douglas fambrough so we have – we do not have an announced program in ttr however there clearly has been a change in the competitive landscape it is certainly amongst that when i referred to a deep bowl of opportunities for rnai in the liver ttr is part of that and i don’t think at this point we’re in a position to talk about a strategy with respect to that target specifically one would have to consider both the competitive landscape and frankly at this point whether the type of cardiomyopathy patients who are being treated are in fact amenable to rnai treatment at all given the apparent lack of efficacy in that population despite dosing which should have resulted in substantial reduction in circulating ttr though we await full look at that data varun kumar okay thank you and thank you for taking my questions operator i’m not showing any further questions on the phone lines at this time dr fambrough please proceed with any further remarks douglas fambrough well i want to thank you for your attention today the galxc platform provides dicerna with a stronger foundation than we’ve ever had for building a great company
