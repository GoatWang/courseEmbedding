nov   p kevin morleytimesdispatch david and linda evans wanted to be closer to their children and grandchildren in the richmond area so two years ago they sold their home in new kent county and moved into a rental in west broad village in western henrico countysince then they have been searching for a home to buy they recently decided on greengate a acre mixeduse development under construction about  miles west of where the evanses live in the short pump area of western henrico countythey aren’t moving far and the couple like what greengate has to offerthe development which is under construction is touted as offering the look feel and vibe of richmond’s distinctive urban neighborhoods like the fan and the museum districts but in a suburban setting designed with such amenities as shopping and restaurants just steps away“we heard about greengate and decided that was the environment we wanted to be in” said david evans who is retired“we love being able to walk to things” linda evans said “this is what we are looking for they will have a starbucks with a wine bar and a mellow mushroom pizza restaurant then they will have medical office buildings so you can walk to your doctor’s office across the street is wegmans grocery store it’s like the perfect location”that type of enthusiasm is gratifying to james b gurley jr a principal with markeleagle partners llc which is developing greengate markeleagle partners is a real estate investment company jointly owned by the markel ventures subsidiary of specialty insurer markel corp and principals of the eagle costhe partnership’s other developments have included west broad village a oncestruggling mixeduse development that markeleagle partners llc took over in  and turned aroundgurley is banking on the appeal of greengate to be as populardespite the talk of millennials opting for downtown urban living suburbia remains the housing choice for most people living in the  largest metropolitan areas according to an analysis by the washingtonbased urban land institute a land use thinktank the institute examines housing trends in a report published last month titled “housing in the evolving american suburb”markel eagle partners purchased the greengate land in  paying  million for two tracts —  acres from the oscar n nuckols family trust and nearly  acres from sheila and hugh a worcestermarkel eagle later sold  acres on the western edge of the site to chesterbased shamin hotels which is planning to build a room hampton inn  suites hotel on the acreage construction is slated to start later this year on that projectthe greengate development will have  square feet of retail space anchored by a squarefoot lidl grocery store and about a halfdozen restaurantsconstruction on the lidl store is well underway as the european grocery chain prepares for its aggressive expansion into the us the chain has not made any individual store announcements or set opening dates but plans to have the first us stores open no later than  said lidl us spokesman will harwoodthe other retail in greengate will be housed in seven architecturally distinct buildingsrestaurants include west coast provisions and the daily kitchen  bar two concepts from richmond restaurant group which owns east coast provisions in carytown the group owns area restaurants including the hard shell the hill café and pearl raw baranother restaurant in greengate will be red salt chophouse and sushi restaurant from eat restaurant partners which operates seven restaurants in the richmond area including fat dragon foo dog and wild gingerthose eateries will join mellow mushroom pizzeria and starbucks as tenants in greengatejames ren mefford director of operations for eat restaurant partners said they hope to open red salt in early june in addition to indoor seating the restaurant will have a heated patio plus a large room to host private events“when we saw the scope of this development there were two things that we really liked” mefford said “we like the mixeduse with large residential area behind it that makes it sort of selffeeding then obviously that area is really hot out there”the other attraction was the emphasis on local retailers mefford saidtenants for the retail space include carytown bicycle co cyclebar indoor exercise cycling studio and polished nail salonin addition two squarefoot threestory medical office buildings will be constructed at the rear of the commercial space gurley said he hopes to announce a tenant of one of the buildings soon“we are hard at work on the spaces that we’ve leased building them out” gurley said last week“several of the tenants are expected to begin construction of their building interiors in the next couple of weeks  mellow mushroom is pretty far along and building out their space we’re over  percent preleased on the retail and all of that will open in the spring”at the rear of the development will be the residential component consisting of  town homes and singlefamily homes priced from  to architectural renderings of the development show treelined streets buildings with distinct ornamental features like those you might find on centuryold structures in the fan patios for outdoor dining plus miniparks and sidewalks for strolling“what really drove us was there’s so much that makes richmond a unique place a special place” gurley said “there’s a ton of history the architecture is really special if you go to the bottom or the fan or monument avenue the homes along there the warehouses and the older office buildings there is a real history here”at greengate “we set about trying to define a development with character” gurley said “to do that and to do that with a level of authenticity we sought some help burt pinnock of baskervill architects has kind of been my partner from the beginning on what the commercial should look like how it should feel what kind of place we are going to create”pinnock said the design team looked for inspiration in the neighborhoods of richmond“our offices are located here in shockoe bottom” said pinnock referring to baskervill “so that is what we looked to and that is what we took our inspiration from when we started”they also looked at carytown noting the architecture but also “the idea of scale and relationship of sidewalk to building building to people and so forth we kind of collected all of that imagery into our collective libraries and that is what we drew off of to create some of the things we did at greengate” pinnock saidgreengate is still a work in progress but the shells of buildings are up on a recent tour gurley pointed out features that illustrate their efforts to provide a unique sense of placefor instance the building that will house the starbucks has distinctive brick work around the windows and exterior of the buildingspinnock described the features “the starbucks building was inspired by some of the ideas of our older industrial buildings — the gabled roof the stepped parapets but also the brick patterning and the recessed areas of the façade” pinnock saidpinnock said his favorite of the buildings is the one that will house richmond restaurant group’s the daily“it’s reminiscent of the iron fronts that are on main street just about five blocks from my office those kinds of things are what inspired us and i hope we are successful in pulling it off” pinnock said the attention being paid to the look of greengate also is being paid to the retail tenant mix said harrison hall of divaris real estate inc hall and peter vick also of divaris are handling the retail commercial leases chris rice and kyle burns of nai eagle are handling office space leasesunleased spaces include  square feet at the other end of the building that houses the starbucks the developer purposefully is being selective about tenants that will complement the concept“we have a very wellknown national retailer we are negotiating with” for that space hall saidthere is probably one space left that could accommodate a fullservice sitdown restaurant he said“we are in talks with another wellknown fantastic local restaurant tenant for that one remaining space and hopefully will have something to announce in the coming weeks” hall saidrents are in line with the rest of the market he said“we feel like we offer a distinct price point and a very different experience and a type of center that truly does not exist in short pump other than at greengate” hall saidgurley was exuberant last week as he walked around the development“the idea is that it’s a vibrant place that feels alive” gurley saidin addition to the architectural touches there will be artistic touches — murals on the sides of some of the buildingslocal artist ed trask is leading that effort gurley said even the big utility company transformer boxes will get attention the idea as of now is to have a weekend paintingart party event in the spring when the retailers are open gurley saidad vice studios llc of mechanicsville is the contractor doing the big monument signs on broad street that will carry the development’s name and tenant listas of last week a dozen homes in the development had been sold according to a leasing agentin addition to the evanses ted and carrie theisen are among the first buyers the theisens plan to relocate from northern virginia and move to greengate this summer their youngest son is graduating from high school in june and will be off to college so it’s a good time to move carrie theisen said she and her husband work at companies that have offices in the richmond areathey have decided on the development’s largest town home the squarefoot boulevard model all the models except one include an elevatorneighborhood walkability was an important factor theisen said that plus the reputation of eagle builders and the wegmans grocery store across broad street sealed the deal for them she said“having a community where we could walk to both restaurants and grocery stores is really really important to us” theisen said“the way that the community is set up  they have some green space that is separating the retail area from the living space was really attractive to us  we looked at several developments” she said but greengate “was the one that really appealed to us the most” tlsmithtimesdispatchcom     gurley p kevin
