scynexis welcome scynexis inc is a biotechnology company committed to positively impacting the lives of patients suffering from difficulttotreat and often lifethreatening infections by delivering innovative antiinfective therapies our scientists have extensive experience in the life sciences industry having together and individually been involved in the discovery and development of innovative medicines over a broad range of therapeutic areas we are developing our lead product candidate scy a novel and structurally distinct triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor scy is in phase  clinical development as an oral and intravenous drug for the treatment of several fungal infections including serious and lifethreatening invasive fungal infections   recent news view rss feed pipeline  scynexis pipeline pipeline pipeline we are developing our lead product candidate scy as a novel oral and intravenous iv drug for the treatment of several fungal infections including serious and lifethreatening invasive fungal infections scy is a novel and structurally distinct triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in vitro and in vivo against a broad range of candida and aspergillus species including drugresistant strains scy has also demonstrated in vitro activity against the multidrug resistant pathogen candida auris which has been classified by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc as an emerging serious global health threat our first phase  study of scy in patients with invasive candidiasis confirmed the achievement of plasma target exposures of scy and adequate tolerability after oral administration in a completed phase  study in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis vvc scy showed clinical proofofconcept against candida infections in humans scy is fungicidal against candida through the inhibition of beta  d glucan synthesis in the cell wall of fungi resulting in cell death scy is the only triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor with both oral and iv formulations in clinical development with the potential to allow firstline treatment and oral step down in the same class invasive fungal infections are an increasing problem for the healthcare system with candida and aspergillus species responsible for approximately  of all invasive fungal infections in the united states and europe these infections occur in the sickest of patients including those receiving chemotherapy for cancer or undergoing stem cell or organ transplants and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality candida ranks as the fourth most common hospitalacquired bloodstream infection in the united states recent data indicate a dramatic shift to candida infections with increasing resistance to antifungal drugs including azoles and echinocandins there are few therapeutic alternatives for these multidrug resistant infections the cdc has listed fluconazoleresistant candida as a serious threat requiring prompt and sustained action scy holds both fast track and qualified infectious disease product qidp designations for the oral and iv formulations for the indications of invasive candidiasis including candidemia and invasive aspergillosis scy also holds orphan drug designation odd for both indications  these designations are designed to facilitate the development and expedite review of drugs by allowing companies to interact with the us food and drug administration fda review team frequently additionally the odd of scy provides seven years of market exclusivity in the us following fda approval which in conjunction with qidp designation which grants an additional five years of exclusivity provides scynexis with a potential  years of market exclusivity upon fda approval of scy we believe that scy has the potential to play an important role in treating patients with invasive fungal infections particularly those infected with resistant candida and aspergillus species we are continuing to advance the development of scy for a number of antifungal infections and are planning additional nonclinical development activities to support our development program including futher characterization of the antifungal spectrum of activity we may also develop scy as a treatment for recurrent vvc commonly known as a yeast infection and have completed a phase  proofofconcept study in patients with vvc the positive results provided evidence of the antifungal activity of orally administered scy in patients with candida infections vvc is caused by candida albicans an estimated  of women of reproductive age will have at least one episode of vvc during their lifetime and  will experience two or more episodes as many as seven to nine percent of these patients suffer from recurrent vvc or at least four episodes during a month period there are currently no products approved for recurrent vvc company officers  about  scynexis about about us company officers board of directors strategic partnerships
