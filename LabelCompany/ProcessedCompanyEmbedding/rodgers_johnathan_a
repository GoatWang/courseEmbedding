  lindsay quality  value  meets expectations  i did not realize that i havent posted anything since january this is quite crazy and a lot has happened in the last seven months but i did just finish a book the first one in quite awhile and i am supposed to review it so here goes nothing the book i read is called the charlatans boy by johnathan rogers i had chosen to review this book because everyone just raved about how it was soooo good ill admit i was really excited when it came in the mail and even though i didnt really have the time i read a few pages every night it was not at all what i expected unfortunately the story did not grab my attention right away and i found it hard to follow because it was taking place in a foreign land that does not exist when i read books i like to be able to imagine my self taking a vacation to that place or being in the charachters shoes this was not a story where i could do that if you like a good book about makebelieve then i suggest you read this book it is very well written but just not my style i wish i could even give a summary but i just dont even know how to explain it so if you would like to know what the book is about i suggest you look up the title on wwwcbdcom i hope this review was at least a little bit helpful in deciding whether or not it is the right book for you i received a copy of this book for from waterbrook multnomah publishers in exchange for my review was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate luvreadjen lisle il age  gender female  stars out of  fun fancy for younger readers june   luvreadjen lisle il age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  if you have ever struggled with who you are with what it means to be you then reading this story will capture your imagination a young boy who doesnt know his past is being raised by a ã¢â¬ëcharlatan who goes from village to village in an imaginary country to earn money by conning people into hearing tales of mythical creatures or having their futures told when the charlatan comes up with a plan to create the ultimate scam a new series of adventures begin so that the rewards will be greater than any they have had before but as the orphan grady seeks to please the professor he struggles with bigger issues  who he is how he matters and whether or not the things they do are morally correct the story is fanciful and fun and it would be a great read especially for younger readers  perhaps in the  year old range there are elements of adventure and surprise along with interesting characters and even a touch of youthful infatuation i enjoyed it certainly and i can think of several young people who would enjoy some of its silliness even while they learned something from its message i wouldnt want to spoil the story so i wont say much about the climax or ending but i thought it was a little unpredictable not so much that a young person would be completely taken off guard by it but enough so that it made the rest of the story much more interesting and colorful in the long run there is no overt spiritual message  no prayerful moments or scripture are directly quoted however the idea that each of us is a spiritual orphan spending our lives looking for the truth of who we are as a creation of god is woven carefully in this story its subtle but its definitely part of the story disclosure of material connection i received this book free from the publisher i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have expressed are my own i am disclosing this

too june   sonora mama age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  i only know one man who might be able to tell me where i come from and that man is a liar and a fraud i just finished the charlatans boy a funny hearttwinging adventure by jonathan rogers the story follows grady a  year old orphan who for as long as he can remember has traveled with floyd a traveling showman or conman floyd passes himself off as an adventurer a perfesser a phrenologist reading head bumps and is just this side of a snakeoil salesman he has spent years passing off grady as a captured member of a race of mysterious swampdwelling wildman feechie folk due to the boys ugly appearance but townspeople no longer believe in the wild feechie folk so floyd is going to stir up an elaborate feechie scare to get back in business grady has always fully inhabited his role as a feechie but in between performances he longs to know who he really is and where he can fully belong floyd has no love for him but where else is the boy to go while traveling the back roads and drumming up a feechie scare so floyd can be paid for his expertise in handling the feechie problem grady meets a colorful cast of characters and tries to figure out who he is sometimes he almost convinces himself hes more than just an ugly boy and that someday someone will accept him the book is at times funny sweet frustrating sad and ultimately satisfying i received a complimentary copy of the charlatans boy for review from waterbrook multnomah publishing group was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as

was a huckster a true fraud and a liar he and grady did the feechie show for many years floyd told all about the legendary feechiefolk while grady played the part of a feechie some really thought grady was a hefeechie but people were no longer afraid of the feechies and didnt believe floyds stories anymore so floyd and grady went from village to village using one scheme after another swindling people out of their money all the time longing to revive the feechie show grady was tired of his lifestyle of living lies he wanted to find his family to know who he was every time he asked floyd where he came from he got told a different story when grady went to a village he searched for someone who was as ugly as he was that could be his family he also missed playing the feechie it had been a part of him for so long floyd cooked up a plan to start a feechie scare to get people talking about feechies again then they could revive their feechie show does grady ever get to be a feechie again does he ever find out the truth about his family read the charlatans boy to discover what becomes of grady floyd and their travelling show this story is set in a time period when people went around making money from villagers using shell games fortune telling juggling acts and such the characters have an interesting dialect  very bad english grady is a likable character with a good heart floyd is not as i was reading through the book i found myself wishing for grady to make a better life for himself and finally belong to someone the author made up names and words that make for an interesting and different type of story if you want to read a book that is nothing like your favorite genre i would recommend this one i received a free copy of this book from waterbrook multnomah for

tucson az age  gender female quality  value  the charlatans boy by jonathan rogers has a cast of characters as colorful as a box of crayons grady is a good hearted young orphan who longs to discover where he came from all he has ever known is a life traveling with floyd a self centered conman and floyd refuses to give him a straight answer on the matter their story is quite unique and unlike any i have ever read before grady watches people in earnest ever searching for a place to fit in and more importantly the parents that he believes he has lost along their journey youll meet the ugliest boy in the world and proud of it an  year old woman who looks like she is  ten finger walter the phrenologist reads peoples personalities through the bumps in their skull and more the charlatans boy is a wonderful combination of robin hood lord of the rings and huckleberry finn follow along with grady and floyd as they travel through the corenwald frontier educating townspeople about the wild feechie folk are they real every day is a new adventure but you never know exactly who you can trust i enjoyed this book but felt that it began to drag a bit near the end i was anxious to see how it would end so perhaps i was just in a hurry to find out what would happen i do feel that it would be a great read aloud for the whole family jonathan rogers blog jonathan on facebook more info read

deftly wielding patricks own writings as a tool with which to divide fact from fiction jonathan rogers does at times share patrician legends but clearly identifies them as such while focusing the main portions of his text on what is verifiable and historically likely and ascertainableat a brief  pages this pursesized volume held me captivated as i entered further into the life theology and writings of patrick the man was truly a believer with a passionate personal relationship with christ during a time in which many in the church were involved for politicalpowerholding reasons his utter dependence on jesus his discarding of anything that hindered his journey his devotion to missions and his clear awareness of christs indwelling presence have endeared patrick to me dare i say it the man has the soul of an evangelicalpublic domain versions of patricks own writings translated from latin to english are included at the books end while they are quoted heavily throughout the book reading his letters as coherent missives definitely adds to an understanding of his personal writing stylenormally i wouldnt be the first person to sign up to read the biography of a catholic saint

as inappropriate carol  stars out of  april   carol the life and times of st patrick are explored in this book there is some information about patrick and the conditions that existed in ireland during the time when the romans occupied the british isles ireland was considered to be a place of heathens and ignorant people so the romans were not interested in going there unfortunately for patrick he was taken there as a slave after the romans had left england exact dates are not known for when st patrick was born and when he died and a lot of what is known about him is a mix of speculation stories exaggerations legends and some factsi did look forward to reading this book and did like it it wasnt a book that kept my interest for long spans of time but i did talk about it with my family so it must have been interesting to me on some level i hate to sound so negative and im really not i did like the book and have always wondered about st patrick i just wish that more information was available the author did a good job with the informations that is avaiable so i dont blame him for any lack of facts i think this book is worth reading if you have any interest in the life of st patricki received this book free from thomas nelson publishers as part of their book review bloggers program i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have expressed are my own i am

in ireland as a teenager to the saint that we know today it was interesting to read since i had always liked the story of saint patrick so it was cool to be able to read his biography to see just how influential he had become with the people of ireland and eventually the rest of the worldoverall its a short book so it makes for an easy read but its not one that youll just forget about it makes you think about just what saint patrick went through and just how devoted to his faith he was that he was willing to go back to barbaric ireland in order to spread the gospel his willingness to do that easily portrays jesuss command to go forth saint patrick did that with an open heart and he was able to gain many converts from people who had never heard the gospel before this short book shows just what can be accomplished when you have the faith to follow through with gods promisethis book was an amazing read and i would recommend it to all of my friends and family who are interested in

share the gospel of christ in addition to giving us a sketch of his life rogers included throughout the book some legends and myths and tries to separate the truth from fiction also patricks own writings are included in the appendices this book was informative but the writing style was not as interesting as i was hoping the first couple pages were setting the historical background and gave the book a slow start but overall the book was a good read if you decide to get this book you should definitely read patricks writings at the end they gave me a better understanding of his beliefs after reading this book i feel like i now have a much better knowledge of this missionary who loved god and the people he servedthomas nelson has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book to critique was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate kady g  stars out of  march   kady g saint patrick is a biography on st patrick st patricks days namesake the major references jonathan rogers used for the books were two of saint patricks books confession and epistle rogers begins the story with a teenage patrick being turned over into slavery and then gradually tells the story of how saint patrick played a major part in converting the irish to christianityone thing i loved about saint patrick was how it read like a novel instead of a justfacts biography it really told patricks story additionally i felt like rogers knew his stuff and presented the facts in a fresh and fun manner i also liked how the chapters were written in chronological order unlike the format of many biographies however i thought the last chapter chapter  rambled a bit another thing that i did not find favorable was how the beginning of the book failed to capture your immediate attention i had to struggle to keep on reading although after i got started i couldnt put the book down all in all i liked jonathan rogers compact biography on st patrickthank you to book sneeze for
