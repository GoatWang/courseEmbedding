prospectus for steinroe trust synopsis the following synopsis should be read in conjunction with the detailed information in this prospectus and the statement of additional information please refer to the glossary of special terms for the meaning of certain defined terms variations from the information appearing in this prospectus due to individual state requirements are described in supplements which are attached to this prospectus or in endorsements to the certificates as appropriate the certificate allows certificate owners to allocate purchase payments to the variable account and also to the fixed account the variable account is a separate investment account maintained by keyport the fixed account is part of keyports general account which consists of all keyports assets except the variable account and the assets of other separate investment accounts maintained by keyport certificate owners may allocate payments to and receive annuity payments from the variable account andor the fixed account if the certificate owner allocates payments to the variable account the accumulation values and annuity payments will fluctuate according to the investment experience of the subaccounts chosen if the certificate owner allocates payments to the fixed account the accumulation values will increase at guaranteed interest rates and annuity payments will be of a fixed amount fixed account values are subject to a limited market value adjustment see keyport and the variable account on page  for more information on the variable account and appendix a on page  for more information on the fixed account if the certificate owner allocates payments to both accounts then the accumulation values and annuity payments will be variable in part and fixed in part the certificate permits purchase payments to be made on a flexible purchase payment basis the minimum initial payment is  the minimum amount for each subsequent payment is  or such lesser amount as keyport may permit from time to time currently  see purchase payments on page  there are no deductions made from purchase payments for sales charges at the time of purchase a contingent deferred sales charge may be deducted in the event of a total or partial surrender see surrender on page  the contingent deferred sales charge is based on a graded table of charges the charge will not exceed  of that portion of the amount surrendered that represents purchase payments made during the seven years immediately preceding the request for surrender see deductions for contingent deferred sales charge on page  keyport deducts a mortality and expense risk charge which is equal on an annual basis to  of the average daily net asset values in the variable account attributable to the certificates see deductions for mortality and expense risk charge on page  keyport also deducts a daily distribution charge which is equal on an annual basis to  of the same values see deductions for daily distribution charge on page  keyport deducts an annual certificate maintenance charge currently  from the variable account value for administrative expenses prior to the income date keyport reserves the right to change this charge for future years keyport will in certain instances waive this charge see deductions for certificate maintenance charge on page  keyport reserves the right to deduct a charge of  for each transfer in excess of  per certificate year but currently does not do so see transfer of variable account value on page  premium taxes will be charged against the certificate value currently such premium taxes range from  to  see deductions for premium taxes on page  there are no federal income taxes on increases in the value of a certificate until a distribution occurs in the form of a lump sum payment annuity payments or the making of a gift or assignment of the certificate a federal penalty tax currently  may also apply see tax status on page  the certificate allows the certificate owner to revoke the certificate generally within  days of delivery see right to revoke on page  for most states keyport will refund the certificate value as of the date the returned certificate is received by keyport

as of november   which is the date the fund subaccount first became available the full financial statements for keyport and the variable account are in the statement of additional information performance information the variable account may from time to time advertise certain performance information concerning its various subaccounts certain of the eligible funds have been available for keyport andor non keyport variable annuity contracts for periods prior to the commencement of the offering of the certificates described in this prospectus any performance information for such periods will be based on the historical results of the eligible funds being applied to the certificate for the specified time periods performance information is not intended to indicate either past performance under an actual certificate or future performance the subaccounts may advertise total return information for various periods of time total return performance information is based on the overall percentage change in value of a hypothetical investment in the specific sub account over a given period of time average annual total return information shows the average percentage change in the value of an investment in the subaccount from the beginning date of the measuring period to the end of that period this standardized version of average annual total return reflects all historical investment results less all charges and deductions applied against the subaccount and a certificate including any contingent deferred sales charge that would apply if a certificate owner surrendered the certificate at the end of each period indicated average total return does not take into account any premium taxes and would be lower if these taxes were included in order to calculate average annual total return keyport divides the change in value of a subaccount under a certificate surrendered on a particular date by a hypothetical  investment in the subaccount made by the certificate owner at the beginning of the period illustrated the resulting total rate for the period is then annualized to obtain the average annual percentage change during the period annualization assumes that the application of a single rate of return each year during the period will produce the ending value taking into account the effect of compounding the subaccounts may present additional total return information computed on a different basis first the subaccounts may present total return information computed on the same basis as described above except deductions will not include the contingent deferred sales charge this presentation assumes that the investment in the certificate continues beyond the period when the contingent deferred sales charge applies consistent with the longterm investment and retirement objectives of the certificate the total return percentage will thus be higher under this method than the standard method described above second the subaccounts may present total return information calculated by dividing the change in a subaccounts accumulation unit value over a specified time period by the accumulation unit value of that subaccount at the beginning of the period this computation results in a month change rate or for longer periods a total rate for the period which keyport annualizes in order to obtain the average annual percentage change in the accumulation unit value for that period the change percentages do not take into account the contingent deferred sales charge the certificate maintenance charge and premium tax charges the percentages would be lower if these charges were included the steinroe cash income subaccount is a money market subaccount that also may advertise yield and effective yield information the yield of the sub account refers to the income generated by an investment in the subaccount over a specifically identified day period this income is annualized by assuming that the amount of income generated by the investment during that week is generated each week over a week period and is shown as a percentage the yield reflects the deduction of all charges assessed against the subaccount and a certificate but does not take into account contingent deferred sales charges and premium tax charges the yield would be lower if these charges were included the effective yield of the steinroe cash income subaccount is calculated in a similar manner but when annualizing such yield income earned by the sub account is assumed to be reinvested this compounding effect causes effective yield to be higher than yield keyport and the variable account keyport life insurance company was incorporated in rhode island in  as a stock life insurance company its executive and administrative offices are at  high street boston massachusetts  its home office is at  promenade street providence rhode island  and will be relocated in may  to  george washington highway lincoln rhode island  keyport writes individual and group annuity contracts on a nonparticipating basis keyport is licensed to do business in all states except new york and is also licensed in the district of columbia and the virgin islands keyport has been rated a superior by am best and company independent analysts of the insurance industry keyport has been rated a each year since  the first year keyport was subject to bests alphabetic rating system standard  poors s  p has rated keyport aa for excellent financial security moodys has rated keyport a for good financial strength and duff  phelps has rated keyport aa for very high claims paying ability the bests a rating is in the highest rating category which also includes a s  p and duff  phelps have one rating category above aa and moodys has two rating categories above a the moodys  modifier signifies that keyport is in the higher end of the a category while the sp and duff  phelps  modifier signifies that keyport is at the lower end of the aa category these ratings merely reflect the opinion of the rating company as to the relative financial strength of keyport and keyports ability to meet its contractual obligations to its policyholders even though assets in the variable account are held separately from keyports other assets ratings of keyport may still be relevant to certificate owners since not all of keyports contractual obligations relate to payments based on those segregated assets eg see death provisions for keyports obligation after certain deaths to increase the certificate value if it is less than death benefit amount or otherwise enhance the death benefit with interest keyport is one of the liberty financial companies keyport is ultimately controlled by liberty mutual insurance company of boston massachusetts a multiline insurance company the variable account was established by keyport pursuant to the provisions of rhode island law on january   the variable account meets the definition of separate account under the federal securities laws the variable account is registered with the securities and exchange commission as a unit investment trust under the investment company act of  such registration does not involve supervision of the management of the variable account or keyport by the securities and exchange commission obligations under the certificates are the obligations of keyport although the assets of the variable account are the property of keyport these assets are held separately from the other assets of keyport and are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business keyport may conduct income capital gains andor capital losses whether or not realized from assets allocated to the variable account are credited to or charged against the variable account without regard to the income capital gains andor capital losses arising out of any other business keyport may conduct thus keyport does not guarantee the investment performance of the variable account the variable account value and the amount of variable annuity payments will vary with the investment performance of the investments in the variable account purchase payments and applications the initial purchase payment is due on the certificate date the minimum initial purchase payment is  additional purchase payments can be made at the certificate owners option each subsequent purchase payment must be at least  or such lesser amount as keyport may permit from time to time currently  keyport may reject any purchase payment if the application for a certificate is in good order and it calls for amounts to be allocated to the variable account keyport will apply the initial purchase payment to the variable account and credit the certificate with accumulation units within two business days of receipt if the application for a certificate is not in good order keyport will attempt to get it in good order within five business days if it is not complete at the end of this period keyport will inform the applicant of the reason for the delay and that the purchase payment will be returned immediately unless the applicant specifically consents to keyports keeping the purchase payment until the application is complete once the application is complete the purchase payment will be applied within two business days of its completion keyport has reserved the right to reject any application keyport confirms in writing to the certificate owner the allocation of all purchase payments and the reallocation of values after any requested transfer keyport must be notified immediately by the certificate owner of any processing error keyport will permit others to act on behalf of an applicant in certain instances including the following two examples first keyport will accept an application for a certificate that contains a signature signed under a power of attorney if a copy of that power of attorney is submitted with the application second keyport will issue a certificate that is replacing an existing life insurance or annuity policy that was issued by either keyport or an affiliated company without having previously received a signed application from the applicant certain dealers or other authorized persons such as employers and qualified plan fiduciaries will inform keyport of an applicants answers to the questions in the application by telephone or by order ticket and cause the initial purchase payment to be paid to keyport if the information is in good order keyport will issue the certificate with a copy of an application completed with that information the certificate will be delivered to the certificate owner with a letter from keyport that will give the certificate owner an opportunity to respond to keyport if any of the application information is incorrect alternatively keyports letter may request the certificate owner to confirm the correctness of the information by signing either a copy of the application or a certificate delivery receipt that ratifies the application in all respects in either case a copy of the signed document would be returned to keyport for its permanent records all purchases are confirmed in writing to the applicant by keyport keyports liability under a certificate extends only to amounts so confirmed investments of the variable account allocations of purchase payments purchase payments applied to the variable account will be invested in one or more of the eligible fund subaccounts designated as permissible investments in accordance with the selection made by the certificate owner in the application any selection must specify the percentage of the purchase payment that is allocated to each subaccount or must specify the asset allocation model selected see other services the programs the percentage for each subaccount if not zero must be at least  and must be a whole number a certificate owner may change the allocation percentages without fee penalty or other charge allocation changes must be made by written request unless the certificate owner has by written request authorized keyport to accept telephone allocation instructions from the certificate owner or from a person acting for the certificate owner as an attorneyinfact under a power of attorney by authorizing keyport to accept telephone changes a certificate owner agrees to accept and be bound by the conditions and procedures established by keyport from time to time the current conditions and procedures are in appendix b and certificate owners authorizing telephone allocation instructions will be notified in advance of any changes the variable account is segmented into subaccounts each subaccount contains the shares of one of the eligible funds and such shares are purchased at net asset value eligible

funding are disclosed in the eligible fund prospectuses under the following captions alger american fund participating insurance companies and plans alliance series fund introduction to the fund colonial trustthe trust mfs trust investment concept of the trust and steinroe trustthe trust transfer of variable account value certificate owners may transfer variable account value from one subaccount to another subaccount andor to the fixed account the certificate allows keyport to charge a transfer fee and to limit the number of transfers that can be made in a specified time period certificate owners should be aware that transfer limitations may prevent a certificate owner from making a transfer on the date he or she wants to with the result that the certificate owners future certificate value may be lower than it would have been had the transfer been made on the desired date currently keyport has no limit on the number or frequency of transfers and it is not charging a transfer fee of  for each transfer in excess of  per certificate year however for transfers under different certificates that are being requested under powers of attorney with a common attorneyin fact or that are in keyports determination based on the recommendation of a common investment adviser or brokerdealer there is a transfer limitation of one transfer every  days or such shorter time period as keyport may permit currently keyport is limiting each transfer to a maximum of  or such greater amount as keyport may permit all transfers requested for a certificate on the same day will be treated as a single transfer and the total combined transfer amount will be subject to the  limitation if the  limitation is exceeded no amount of the transfer will be executed by keyport in applying the  limitation keyport may treat as one transfer all transfers requested by a certificate owner for multiple certificates he or she owns if the  limitation is exceeded for multiple transfers requested on the same day that are treated as a single transfer no amount of the transfer will be executed by keyport in applying the  limitation to transfers requested by a common attorneyinfact or investment adviser keyport will treat as one transfer all transfers requested under different certificates that are being requested under powers of attorney with a common attorneyinfact or that are in keyports determination based on the recommendation of a common investment adviser or brokerdealer if the  limitation is exceeded for multiple transfers requested on the same day that are treated as a single transfer no amount of the transfer will be executed by keyport if a transfer is executed under one certificate and within the next  days a transfer request for another certificate is determined by keyport to be related to the executed transfer under this paragraphs rules the transfer request will not be executed by keyport in order for it to be executed it would need to be requested again after the  day period has expired and it along with any other transfer requests that are collectively treated as a single transfer would need to total less than  keyports interest in applying these limitations is to protect the interests of both certificate owners who are not engaging in significant transfer activity and certificate owners who are engaging in such activity keyport has determined that the actions of certificate owners engaging in significant transfer activity among subaccounts may cause an adverse affect on the performance of the eligible fund for the subaccount involved the movement of subaccount values from one subaccount to another may prevent the appropriate eligible fund from taking advantage of investment opportunities because it must maintain a liquid position in order to handle redemptions such movement may also cause a substantial increase in fund transaction costs which must be indirectly borne by certificate owners certificate owners will be notified in advance of the imposition of any transfer fee or of a change in the limitation on the number of transfers the fee will not exceed the lesser of  and the cost of effecting a transfer transfers must be made by written request unless the certificate owner has by written request authorized keyport to accept telephone transfer requests from the certificate owner or from a person acting for the certificate owner as an attorneyinfact under a power of attorney by authorizing keyport to accept telephone transfer instructions a certificate owner agrees to accept and be bound by the conditions and procedures established by keyport from time to time the current conditions and procedures are in appendix b and certificate owners authorizing telephone transfers will be notified in advance of any changes written transfer requests may be made by a person acting for the certificate owner as an attorneyinfact under a power of attorney transfer requests received by keyport before the close of trading on the new york stock exchange currently  pm eastern time will be initiated at the close of business that day any requests received later will be initiated at the close of the next business day each request from a certificate owner to transfer value will be executed by both redeeming and acquiring accumulation units on the day keyport initiates the transfer if  of any subaccounts value is transferred and the allocation formula for purchase payments includes that subaccount then the allocation formula for future purchase payments will automatically change unless the certificate owner instructs otherwise for example if the allocation formula is  to subaccount a and  to subaccount b and all of subaccount as value is transferred to subaccount b the allocation formula will change to  to subaccount b unless the certificate owner instructs otherwise substitution of eligible funds and other variable account changes if the shares of any of the eligible funds should no longer be available for investment by the variable account or if in the judgment of keyports management further investment in such fund shares should become inappropriate in view of the purpose of the certificate keyport may add or substitute shares of another eligible fund or of another mutual fund for eligible fund shares already purchased under the certificate no substitution of fund shares in any subaccount may take place without prior approval of the securities and exchange commission and notice to certificate owners to the extent required by the investment company act of  keyport has also reserved the right subject to compliance with the law as currently applicable or subsequently changed a to operate the variable account in any form permitted under the investment company act of  or in any other form permitted by law b to take any action necessary to comply with or obtain and continue any exemptions from the investment company act of  or to comply with any other applicable law c to transfer any assets in any subaccount to another subaccount or to one or more separate investment accounts or to keyports general account or to add combine or remove subaccounts in the variable account and d to change the way keyport assesses charges so long as the aggregate amount is not increased beyond that currently charged to the variable account and the eligible funds in connection with the certificates deductions deductions for certificate maintenance charge keyport has responsibility for all administration of the certificates and the variable account this administration includes but is not limited to preparation of the certificates maintenance of certificate owners records and all accounting valuation regulatory and reporting requirements keyport makes a certificate maintenance charge for such services during the accumulation and annuity payment periods at the present time the certificate maintenance charge is  per certificate year prior to the income date the certificate maintenance charge is not guaranteed and may be changed by keyport the certificate maintenance charge will be waived before the income date if i it is the first certificate anniversary or ii the certificate value is greater than or equal to  on the certificate anniversary date this charge is imposed or iii purchase payments of at least  have been made in the prior certificate year and there has been no partial withdrawal in the prior certificate year the certificate maintenance charge will be waived on and after the income date for the current year if i variable annuity option a income for a fixed number of years is applicable and ii at the time of the first payment of the year the present value of all of the remaining payments see option a on page  is greater than or equal to  prior to the income date the full amount of the charge will be deducted from the variable account value on each certificate anniversary and on the date of any total surrender not falling on the certificate anniversary on the income date a prorata portion of the charge due on the next certificate anniversary will be deducted from the variable account value this prorata charge covers the period from the prior certificate anniversary to the income date for example if the income date occurs  days after that prior anniversary then onefifth ie  days days of the annual charge would be deducted on the income date the charge will be deducted from each subaccount in the proportion that the value of each bears to the variable account value once annuity payments begin on the income date or once they begin after surrender benefits are applied under a settlement option the yearly cost of the certificate maintenance charge for a payees annuity will be the same as the yearly amount in effect immediately before the annuity payments begin keyport may not later change the amount of the certificate maintenance charge deducted from the annuity payments the charge will be deducted on a prorata basis from each annuity payment for example if annuity payments are monthly then onetwelfth of the annual charge will be deducted from each payment deductions for mortality and expense risk charge although variable annuity payments made to annuitants will vary in accordance with the investment performance of the investments of the variable account they will not be affected by the mortality experience death rate of persons receiving such payments or of the general population keyport guarantees the death benefits described below see death provisions keyport assumes an expense risk since the certificate maintenance charge after the income date will stay the same and not be affected by variations in expenses to compensate it for assuming mortality and expense risks for each valuation period keyport deducts from each subaccount a mortality and expense risk charge equal on an annual basis to  of the average daily net asset value of the subaccount the charge is deducted during both the accumulation and annuity periods ie both before and after the income date less than the full charge will be deducted from subaccount values attributable to certificates issued to employees of keyport and other persons specified in sales of the certificates deductions for daily distribution charge keyport also deducts from each subaccount each valuation period a daily distribution charge equal on an annual basis to  of the average daily net asset value of the subaccount this charge compensates keyport for certain sales distribution expenses relating to the certificate this charge will not be deducted from subaccount values attributable to certificates that have reached the maximum cumulative distribution charge limit defined below and to certificates issued to employees of keyport and other persons specified in sales of the certificates the charge is also not deducted from subaccount values attributable to annuity units keyport may decide not to deduct the charge from subaccount values attributable to a certificate issued in an internal exchange or transfer of an annuity contract of keyports general account deductions for contingent deferred sales charge a sales charge is not deducted from the certificates purchase payments when initially received however a contingent deferred sales charge may be deducted upon a surrender in order to determine whether a contingent deferred sales charge will be due upon a partial or total surrender keyport maintains a separate set of records these records identify the date and amount of each purchase payment made to the certificate and the certificate value over time certificate owners will be permitted to make partial surrenders during the accumulation period without incurring a contingent deferred sales charge as follows  in any certificate year certificate owners may withdraw an aggregate amount not to exceed at the time of the withdrawal the certificates earnings which equal a the certificate value less b the portion of the purchase payments not previously withdrawn  in any certificate year after the first certificate owners may withdraw in addition to the amount available in  the amount by which  of the certificate value as of the preceding certificate anniversary exceeds the amount available in  contingent deferred sales charges as discussed below will be deducted with respect to withdrawals in excess of these amounts in computing the applicable charge amounts the amount of any surrender in any certificate year after the first as set forth in  above will be deducted from the purchase payments in chronological order from the oldest to the most recent until the amount is fully deducted any amount so deducted will not be subject to a charge the following additional amounts will be deducted from the purchase payments in the same chronological order the amount of any surrender in the first certificate year in excess of the amount set forth in  above and the amount of any surrender in any later certificate year in excess of the combined amount set forth in  and  above the contingent deferred sales charge for each purchase payment from which a deduction is made will be equal to a multiplied by b where a is the amount so deducted and b is the applicable percentage for the number of years that have elapsed from the date of that payment to the date of surrender years are measured from the month and day of payment to the same month and day in each subsequent calendar year the percentages applicable to each purchase payment during the seven years after the date of its payment are  during year   during year   during year   during year   during year   during year   during year  and  thereafter the applicable contingent deferred sales charges for each purchase payment are then totaled the lesser of this total amount and the certificates maximum cumulative distribution charge will be deducted from the certificate value in the same manner as the surrender amount the maximum cumulative distribution charge is equal to a less b where a is  of the total purchase payments made to the certificate and b is the sum of all prior contingent deferred sale charge deductions from the certificate value and all prior variable account daily distribution charges applicable to the certificate from the  distribution charge factor after each surrender keyports records will be adjusted to reflect any deductions made from the applicable purchase payments example two purchase payments were made one year apart for  and  the certificate value has grown to an assumed  when the certificate owner decides to withdraw  the certificate value at the beginning of the certificate year of surrender was  the contingent deferred sales charge percentages at the time of surrender are an assumed  for the  payment and  for the  payment the portion of the surrender representing the certificates earnings  less  or  would not be subject to charges since  is less than the amount guaranteed not to have charges  of  or  an additional  would not be subject to charges this  would be deducted from the oldest purchase payment reducing it from  to  the  increase in value plus the additional  leaves       to be deducted this  would be deducted from the  of the first payment still left and  of the second payment the total contingent deferred sales charge would be  multiplied by the applicable  and  times the applicable  or a total of  the distribution charge records would now reflect  for the st payment and  for the nd payment the  requested plus the  charge would be deducted from certificate values under the rules specified in partial withdrawals and surrender on page  the contingent deferred sales charge when it is applicable will be used to cover the expenses of selling the certificate including compensation paid to selling dealers and the cost of sales literature any expenses not covered by the charge will be paid from keyports general account which may include monies deducted from the variable account for the mortality and expense risk charge a dealer selling the certificate may receive up to  of purchase payments with additional compensation later based on the certificate value of those payments during certain time periods selected by keyport and kfsc the percentage may increase to  the contingent deferred sales charge will be waived in the event a covered person is confined in a medical facility in accordance with the provisions and conditions of an endorsement relating to such confinements the contingent deferred sales charge will be eliminated under certificates issued to employees of keyport and other persons specified in sales of the certificates keyport may reduce or change to  any contingent deferred sales charge percentage under a certificate issued in an internal exchange or transfer of an annuity contract of keyports general account keyport may allow under the systematic withdrawal program and under other permitted circumstances all or part of the amount in  above to also be available in the first certificate year if so the amount in  above will be calculated by substituting the initial purchase payment for the certificate value deductions for transfers of variable account value the certificate allows keyport to charge a transfer fee currently no fee is being charged certificate owners will be notified in advance of the imposition of any fee the fee will not exceed the lesser of  and the cost of effecting a transfer deductions for premium taxes keyport deducts the amount of any premium taxes levied by any state or governmental entity when paid unless keyport elects to defer such deduction it is not possible to describe precisely the amount of premium tax payable on any transaction involving the certificate offered hereby such premium taxes depend among other things on the type of certificate qualified or non qualified on the state of residence of the certificate owner the state of residence of the annuitant the status of keyport within such states and the insurance tax laws of such states currently such premium taxes range from  to  of either total purchase payments or certificate value deductions for income taxes keyport will deduct from any amount payable under the certificate any income taxes that a governmental authority requires keyport to withhold with respect to that amount see income tax withholding and taxsheltered annuities total variable account expenses total variable account expenses in relation to the certificate will be the certificate maintenance charge the mortality and expense risk charge and the daily sales charge the value of the assets in the variable account will reflect the value of eligible fund shares and therefore the deductions from and expenses paid out of the assets of the eligible funds these deductions and expenses are described in the eligible fund prospectuses other services the programs keyport offers several investment related programs which are available only prior to the income date asset allocation dollar cost averaging systematic investment and systematic withdrawal programs a rebalancing program is available prior to and after the income date under each program the related transfers between and among subaccounts and the fixed account are not counted as one of the twelve free transfers each of the programs has its own requirements as discussed below keyport reserves the right to terminate any program if the certificate owner has submitted the required telephone authorization form certain changes may be made by telephone for those programs involving transfers owners may change instructions by telephone with regard to which subaccounts or the fixed account certificate value may be transferred the current conditions and procedures are described in appendix b dollar cost averaging program keyport offers a dollar cost averaging program that certificate owners may participate in by written request the program periodically transfers accumulation units from the steinroe cash income sub account or the oneyear guarantee period of the fixed account to other sub accounts selected by the certificate owner the program allows a certificate owner to invest in variable subaccounts over time rather than having to invest in those subaccounts all at once the program is available for initial and subsequent purchase payments and for certificate value transferred into the steinroe cash income subaccount or the oneyear guarantee period under the program keyport makes automatic transfers on a periodic basis out of the steinroe cash income subaccount or the oneyear guarantee period into one or more of the other available subaccounts keyport reserves the right to limit the number of subaccounts the certificate owner may choose but there are currently no limits the certificate owner by written request must specify the steinroe cash income subaccount or the one year guarantee period from which the transfers are to be made the monthly amount to be transferred minimum  and the subaccounts to which the transfers are to be made the first transfer will occur at the close of the valuation period that includes the th day after the receipt of the certificate owners written request each succeeding transfer will occur one month later eg if the th day after the receipt date is april  the second transfer will occur at the close of the valuation period that includes may  when the remaining value is less than the monthly transfer amount that remaining value will be transferred and the program will end before this final transfer the certificate owner may extend the program by allocating additional purchase payments to the steinroe cash income subaccount or the one year guarantee period or by transferring certificate value to the steinroe cash income subaccount or the one year guarantee period the certificate owner may by written request or by telephone change the monthly amount to be transferred change the sub accounts to which the transfers are to be made or end the program the program will automatically end if the income date occurs keyport reserves the right to end the program at any time by sending the certificate owner a notice one month in advance written or telephone instructions must be received by keyport by the end currently  pm eastern time of the business day preceding the next scheduled transfer in order to be in effect for that transfer telephone instructions are subject to the conditions and procedures established by keyport from time to time the current conditions and procedures appear in appendix b and certificate owners in a dollar cost averaging program will be notified in advance of any changes asset allocation program certificate owners may select from five asset allocation model portfolios developed by ibbotoson associates model a  capital preservation model b  income and growth model c  moderate growth model d  growth and model e  aggressive growth if a certificate owner elects one of the models initial and subsequent purchase payments will automatically be allocated among the subaccounts in the model only one model may be used in a certificate at a time certificate owners may use a questionnaire and scoring system to determine the model which corresponds to their risk tolerance and time horizons periodically ibbotoson associates will review the models and may determine that a reconfiguration of the subaccounts and percentage allocations among those subaccounts is appropriate certificate owners will receive notification prior to any reconfiguration the fixed account is not available in any asset allocation model a certificate owner may allocate initial or subsequent purchase payments or certificate value between an asset allocation model and the fixed account rebalancing program in accordance with the certificate owners election of the relative purchase payment percentage allocations keyport will automatically rebalance the certificate value of each subaccount quarterly on the last day of the calendar quarter keyport will automatically rebalance the certificate value in each of the subaccounts to match the current purchase payment percentage allocations the program may be terminated at any time and the percentages may be altered by written request the requested change must be received at the office ten  days prior to the end of the calendar quarter certificate value allocated to the fixed account is not subject to automatic rebalancing after the income date automatic rebalancing applies only to variable annuity payments and keyport will rebalance the number of annuity units in each subaccount annuity units are used to calculate the amount of each subaccount annuity payment see variable annuity benefits in the statement of additional information systematic investment program purchase payments may be made by monthly draft against the bank account of any certificate owner who has completed and returned to keyport a systematic investment program application and authorization form the application and authorization form may be obtained from keyport or from the sales representative each systematic investment program purchase payment is subject to a minimum of  or such lesser amount as keyport may permit systematic withdrawal program to the extent permitted by law keyport will make monthly quarterly semiannually or annual distributions of a predetermined dollar amount to the certificate owner that has enrolled in the systematic withdrawal program under the program all distributions will be made directly to the certificate owner and will be treated for federal tax purposes as any other withdrawal or distribution of certificate value see tax status the certificate owner may specify the amount of each partial withdrawal subject to a minimum of  systematic withdrawals may be made from any subaccount or guarantee period of the fixed account in each certificate year portions of certificate value may be withdrawn without the imposition of any contingent deferred sales charge free withdrawal amount if withdrawals pursuant to the program are greater than the free withdrawal amount the amount of the withdrawals greater than the free withdrawal amount will be subject to the applicable contingent deferred sales charge any unrelated voluntary partial withdrawal a certificate owner makes during a certificate year will be aggregated with withdrawals pursuant to the program to determine the applicability of any contingent deferred sales charge under the certificate provisions regarding partial withdrawals unless the certificate owner specifies the subaccount or subaccounts or the fixed account from which withdrawals of certificate value shall be made or if the amount in a specified subaccount is less than the predetermined amount keyport will make withdrawals under the program in the manner specified for partial withdrawals in partial withdrawals and surrender all subaccount withdrawals under the program will be effected by canceling the number of accumulation units equal in value to the amount to be distributed to the certificate owner and any applicable contingent deferred sales charge the program may be combined with all other programs except the systematic investment program it may not be advisable to participate in the systematic withdrawal program and incur a contingent deferred sales charge when making additional purchase payments under the certificate the certificates variable account value the variable account value for a certificate is the sum of the value of each subaccount to which values are allocated under a certificate the value of each subaccount is determined at any time by multiplying the number of accumulation units attributable to that subaccount by the accumulation unit value for that subaccount at the time of determination the accumulation unit value is an accounting unit of measure used to determine the change in an accumulation units value from valuation period to valuation period each purchase payment that is made results in additional accumulation units being credited to the certificate and the appropriate subaccount thereunder the number of additional units for any subaccount will equal the amount allocated to that subaccount divided by the accumulation unit value for that subaccount at the time of investment valuation periods the variable account is valued each valuation period using the net asset value of the eligible fund shares a valuation period is the period commencing at the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each valuation date and ending at the close of trading for the next succeeding valuation date a valuation date is each day that the new york stock exchange is open for business the new york stock exchange is currently closed on weekends new years day presidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day net investment factor variable account value will fluctuate in accordance with the investment results of the underlying eligible funds in order to determine how these fluctuations affect value keyport utilizes an accumulation unit value each subaccount has its own accumulation units and value per unit the unit value applicable during any valuation period is determined at the end of that period when keyport first purchased eligible fund shares on behalf of the variable account keyport valued each accumulation unit at a specified dollar amount the unit value for each subaccount in any valuation period thereafter is determined by multiplying the value for the prior period by a net investment factor this factor may be greater or less than  therefore the accumulation unit may increase or decrease from valuation period to valuation period keyport calculates a net investment factor for each subaccount by dividing a by b and then subtracting c ie ab  c where a is equal to i the net asset value per share of the eligible fund at the end of the valuation period plus ii the per share amount of any distribution made by the eligible fund if the exdividend date occurs during that same valuation period b is the net asset value per share of the eligible fund at the end of the prior valuation period c is equal to i the valuation period equivalent of the mortality and expense risk charge plus ii the valuation period equivalent of the daily distribution charge plus iii a charge factor if any for any tax provision established by keyport as a result of the operations of that subaccount if a certificate ever reaches the maximum cumulative sales charge limit defined in deductions for contingent deferred sales charge unit values without cii above will be used thereafter for certificates issued to employees of keyport and other persons specified in sales of the certificates unit values with  in ci above and without cii above will be used unit values without cii above may be used for certain certificates issued in an internal exchange or transfer see deductions for daily distribution charge modification of the certificate only keyports president or secretary may agree to alter the certificate or waive any of its terms any changes must be made in writing and with the certificate owners consent except as may be required by applicable law right to revoke the certificate owner may return the certificate within  days after he or she receives it by delivering or mailing it to keyports office the return of the certificate by mail will be effective when the postmark is affixed to a properly addressed and postageprepaid envelope the returned certificate will be treated as if keyport never issued it and keyport will refund either the certificate value or purchase payments as required by state law for certificates delivered in california to a certificate owner age  or older the certificate owner may return the certificate to keyports office or to the agent from whom the certificate was purchased if the certificate is received at keyports office or by the agent within  days after the certificate owner receives the certificate keyport will refund the certificate value death provisions for nonqualified certificates death of primary owner joint owner or certain nonowner annuitant these provisions apply if before the income date while the certificate is in force the primary certificate owner or any joint certificate owner dies whether or not the decedent is also the annuitant or the annuitant dies under a certificate with a nonnatural certificate owner such as a trust the designated beneficiary will control the certificate after such a death if the decedents surviving spouse if any is the sole designated beneficiary the surviving spouse will automatically become the new sole primary certificate owner as of the decedents date of death and if the annuitant is the decedent the new annuitant will be any living contingent annuitant otherwise the surviving spouse the certificate may continue until another death occurs ie until the death of the annuitant primary certificate owner or joint certificate owner except for this paragraph all of death provisions will apply to that subsequent death in all other cases the certificate may continue up to five years from the date of death during this period the designated beneficiary may exercise all ownership rights including the right to make transfers or partial surrenders or the right to totally surrender the certificate for its surrender value if the certificate is still in effect at the end of the five year period keyport will automatically end it then by paying the certificate value to the designated beneficiary if the designated beneficiary is not then alive keyport will pay any persons named by the designated beneficiary in a written request otherwise the designated beneficiarys estate the covered person under this paragraph shall be the decedent if he or she is the first to die of the primary certificate owner joint certificate owner annuitant or if there is a nonnatural certificate owner such as a trust the annuitant shall be the covered person if the covered person dies the certificate value will be increased as provided below if it is less than the death benefit amount dba the dba is the dba at issue is the initial purchase payment thereafter the dba is calculated for each valuation period by adding any additional purchase payments and deducting any partial withdrawals including any applicable surrender charge this resulting amount is the net purchase payment death benefit the certificate value for each certificate anniversary the anniversary value before the st birthday of the covered person is determined each anniversary value is increased by any purchase payments made after that anniversary this resultant value is then decreased by an amount calculated at the time of any partial withdrawal made after that anniversary the amount is calculated by taking the amount of any partial withdrawal and dividing by the certificate value immediately preceding the partial withdrawal and then multiplying by the anniversary value immediately preceding the withdrawal the greatest anniversary value as so adjusted the greatest anniversary value is the dba unless the net purchase payment death benefit is higher the net purchase payment death benefit will be the dba if such amount is higher than the greatest anniversary value when keyport receives due proof of the covered persons death keyport will compare as of the date of death the certificate value to the dba if the certificate value was less than the dba keyport will increase the current certificate value by the amount of the difference note that while the amount of the difference is determined as of the date of death that amount is not added to the certificate value until keyport receives due proof of death the amount to be credited will be allocated to the variable account andor the fixed account based on the purchase payment allocation selection that is in effect when keyport receives due proof of death whether or not the certificate value is increased because of this minimum death provision the designated beneficiary may by the later of the th day after the covered persons death and the th day after keyport is notified of the death surrender the certificate for the certificate withdrawal value without any applicable contingent deferred sales charge being deducted for a surrender after the applicable  or  day period and for a surrender at any time after the death of a noncovered person any applicable contingent deferred sales charge would be deducted if the certificate is not surrendered it will continue for the time period specified above payment of benefits instead of receiving a lump sum the certificate owner or any designated beneficiary may direct by written request that keyport pay any benefit of  or more under an annuity payment option that meets the following a the first payment to the designated beneficiary must be made no later than one year after the date of death b payments must be made over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond that persons life expectancy and c any

certificate value will be increased as provided below if it is less than the death benefit amount dba as defined above when keyport receives due proof of the annuitants death keyport will compare as of the date of death the certificate value to the dba if the certificate value was less than the dba keyport will increase the current certificate value by the amount of the difference note that while the amount of the difference is determined as of the date of death that amount is not added to the certificate value until keyport receives due proof of death the amount to be credited will be allocated to the variable account andor the fixed account based on the purchase payment allocation selection that is in effect when keyport receives due proof of death whether or not the certificate

owners are permitted but not contingent certificate owners the certificate owner may by written request change the certificate owner primary beneficiary contingent beneficiary or contingent annuitant an irrevocablynamed person may be changed only with the written consent of such person because a change of certificate owner by means of a gift ie a transfer without full and adequate consideration may be a taxable event a certificate owner should consult a competent tax adviser as to the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer any qualified certificate may have limitations on transfer of ownership a certificate owner should consult the plan administrator and a competent tax adviser as to the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer assignment the certificate owner may assign the certificate at any time a copy of any assignment must be filed with keyport the certificate owners rights and those of any revocablynamed person will be subject to the assignment any qualified certificate may have limitations on assignability because an assignment may be a taxable event a certificate owner should consult a competent tax adviser as to the tax consequences resulting from any such assignment partial withdrawals and surrender the certificate owner may make partial withdrawals from the certificate keyport must receive a written request and the minimum amount to be withdrawn must be at least  or such lesser amount as keyport may permit in conjunction with a systematic withdrawal program if the certificate value after a partial withdrawal would be below  keyport will treat the request as a withdrawal of only the excess amount over  the amount withdrawn will include any applicable contingent deferred sales charge and therefore the amount actually withdrawn may be greater than the amount of the surrender check requested unless the request specifies otherwise the total amount withdrawn will be deducted from all subaccounts of the variable account in the ratio that the value in each subaccount bears to the total variable account value if there is no value or insufficient value in the variable account then the amount surrendered or the insufficient portion will be deducted from the fixed account in the ratio that each guarantee periods value bears to the total fixed account value the certificate owner may totally surrender the certificate by making a written request surrendering the certificate will end it upon surrender the certificate owner will receive the certificate withdrawal value keyport will pay the amount of any surrender within seven days of receipt of such request alternatively the certificate owner may purchase for himself or herself an annuity option with any surrender benefit of at least  keyports consent is needed to choose an option if the certificate owner is not a natural person annuity options based on life contingencies cannot be surrendered after annuity payments have begun option a which is not based on life contingencies may be surrendered if a variable payout has been selected because of the potential tax consequences of a full or partial surrender a certificate owner should consult a competent tax adviser regarding a surrender annuity provisions annuity benefits if the annuitant is alive on the income date and the certificate is in force payments will begin under the annuity option or options the certificate owner has chosen the amount of the payments will be determined by applying the certificate value increased or decreased by a limited market value adjustment of fixed account value described in appendix a less any premium taxes not previously deducted and less any applicable certificate maintenance charge on the income date in accordance with the option selected income date and annuity option the certificate owner may select an income date and an annuity option at the time of application if the certificate owner does not select an annuity option option b will automatically be designated if the certificate owner does not select an income date for the annuitant the income date will automatically be the earlier of i the later of the annuitants th birthday and the th certificate anniversary and ii any maximum date permitted under state law change in income date and annuity option the certificate owner may choose or change an annuity option or the income date by making a written request to keyport at least  days prior to the income date however any income date must be a for fixed annuity options not earlier than the first certificate anniversary and b not later than the earlier of i the later of the annuitants th birthday and the th certificate anniversary and ii any maximum date permitted under state law annuity options the annuity options are option a income for a fixed number of years option b life income with  years of payments guaranteed and option c joint and last survivor income other options may be arranged by mutual consent each option is available in two forms  as a variable annuity for use with the variable account and as a fixed annuity for use with keyports general account fixed account variable annuity payments will fluctuate while fixed annuity payments will not the dollar amount of each fixed annuity payment will be determined by deducting from the fixed account value increased or decreased by a limited market value adjustment described in appendix a any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted and then dividing the remainder by  and multiplying the result by the greater of a the applicable factor shown in the appropriate table in the certificate or b the factor currently offered by keyport at the time annuity payments begin this current factor may be based on the sex of the payee unless to do so would be prohibited by law if no annuity option is selected option b will automatically be applied unless the certificate owner chooses otherwise variable account value less any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted and less any applicable certificate maintenance charge will be applied to a variable annuity option and fixed account value increased or decreased by a limited market value adjustment described in appendix a less any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted will be applied to a fixed annuity option any premium taxes will be deducted proportionately from both variable account value and fixed account value whether variable or fixed the same certificate value applied to each option will produce a different initial annuity payment as well as different subsequent payments the payee is the person who will receive the sum payable under an annuity option any annuity option that provides for payments to continue after the death of the payee will not allow the successor payee to extend the period of time over which the remaining payments are to be made if the amount available to apply under any variable or fixed option is less than  keyport has reserved the right to pay such amount in one sum to the payee in lieu of the payment otherwise provided for annuity payments will be made monthly unless quarterly semi annual or annual payments are chosen by written request however if any payment provided for would be or becomes less than  keyport has the right to reduce the frequency of payments to such an interval as will result in each payment being at least  option a income for a fixed number of years keyport will pay an annuity for a chosen number of years not fewer than  nor over  a period of years over  may be chosen only if it does not exceed the difference between age  and the annuitants age on the date of the first payment at any time while variable annuity payments are being made the payee may elect to receive the following amount a the present value of the remaining payments commuted at the interest rate used to create the annuity factor for this option this interest rate is  per year  per year for oregon certificates unless  per year is chosen by written request at the time the option is selected less b any contingent deferred sales charge due by treating the value defined in a as a total surrender see deductions for contingent deferred sales charge instead of receiving a lump sum the payee may elect another payment option and the amount applied to the option will not be reduced by the charge defined in b above if at the death of the payee option a payments have been made for fewer than the chosen number of years a payments will be continued during the remainder of the period to the successor payee or b that successor payee may elect to receive in a lump sum the present value of the remaining payments commuted at the interest rate used to create the annuity factor for this option for the variable annuity this interest rate is  per year  per year for oregon certificates unless  per year had been chosen by the payee at the time the option was selected the mortality and expense risk charge is deducted during the option a payment period if a variable payout has been selected but keyport has no mortality risk during this period if annual payments are chosen for option a and a variable payout has been selected keyport has available a stabilizing payment option that may be chosen each annual payment will be determined as described in variable annuity payment values each annual payment will then be placed in keyports general account from which it will be paid out in twelve equal monthly payments the sum of the twelve monthly payments will exceed the annual payment amount because of an interest rate factor used by keyport that will vary from year to year the commutation method described above for calculating the present value of remaining payments applies to the annual payments any monthly payments remaining before the next annual payment will be commuted at the interest rate used to determine that years monthly payments see annuity payments on page  for the manner in which option a may be taxed option b life income with  years of payments guaranteed keyport will pay an annuity during the lifetime of the payee if at the death of the payee payments have been made for fewer than  years a payments will be continued during the remainder of the period to the successor payee or b that successor payee may elect to receive in a lump sum the present value of the remaining payments commuted at the interest rate used to create the annuity factor for this option for the variable annuity this interest rate is  per year  per year for oregon certificates unless  per year had been chosen by the payee at the time the option was selected the amount of the annuity payments will depend on the age of the payee on the income date and it may also depend on the payees sex option c joint and last survivor income keyport will pay an annuity for as long as either the payee or a designated second natural person is alive the amount of the annuity payments will depend on the age of both persons on the income date and it may also depend on each persons sex it is possible under this option to receive only one annuity payment if both payees die after the receipt of the first payment or to receive only two annuity payments if both payees die after receipt of the second payment and so on variable annuity payment values the amount of the first variable annuity payment is determined by keyport using an annuity purchase rate that is based on an assumed annual investment return of  per year  per year for oregon certificates unless  is chosen by written request subsequent variable annuity payments will fluctuate in amount and reflect whether the actual investment return of the selected subaccounts after deducting the mortality and expense risk charge is better or worse than the assumed investment return the total dollar amount of each variable annuity payment will be equal to a the sum of all subaccount payments less b the prorata amount of the annual certificate maintenance charge currently a payee may instruct keyport to change the subaccounts used to determine the amount of the variable annuity payments unlimited times every  months proof of age sex and survival of annuitant keyport may require proof of age sex or survival of any payee upon whose age sex or survival payments depend if the age or sex has been misstated keyport will compute the amount payable based on the correct age and sex if income payments have begun any underpayments keyport may have made will be paid in full with the next annuity payment any overpayments unless repaid in one sum will be deducted from future annuity payments until keyport is repaid in full suspension of payments keyport reserves the right to postpone surrender payments from the fixed account for up to six months keyport reserves the right to suspend or postpone any type of payment from the variable account for any period when a the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings b trading on the exchange is restricted c an emergency exists as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable to dispose of securities held in the variable account or determine their value or d the securities and exchange commission permits delay for the protection of security holders the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission shall govern as to whether the conditions described in b and c exist tax status introduction the certificate is designed for use by individuals in retirement plans which may or may not be qualified plans under the provisions of the internal revenue code the code the ultimate effect of federal income taxes on the certificate value on annuity payments and on the economic benefit to the certificate owner annuitant or designated beneficiary depends on the type of retirement plan for which the certificate is purchased and upon the tax and employment status of the individual concerned the discussion contained herein is general in nature and is not intended as tax advice each person concerned should consult a competent tax adviser no attempt is made to consider any applicable state or other tax laws moreover the discussion herein is based upon keyports understanding of current federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of those current federal income tax laws or of the current interpretations by the internal revenue service taxation of annuities in general section  of the code governs taxation of annuities in general there are no income taxes on increases in the value of a certificate until a distribution occurs in the form of a full surrender a partial surrender an assignment or gift of the certificate or annuity payments a trust or other entity owning a nonqualified certificate other than as an agent for an individual is taxed differently increases in the value of a certificate are taxed yearly whether or not a distribution occurs surrenders assignments and gifts a certificate owner who fully surrenders his or her certificate is taxed on the portion of the payment that exceeds his or her cost basis in the certificate for nonqualified certificates the cost basis is generally the amount of the purchase payments made for the certificate and the taxable portion of the surrender payment is taxed as ordinary income for qualified certificates the cost basis is generally zero and the taxable portion of the surrender payment is generally taxed as ordinary income subject to special year income averaging for lumpsum distributions received before january   a designated beneficiary receiving a lump sum surrender benefit after the death of the annuitant or certificate owner is taxed on the portion of the amount that exceeds the certificate owners cost basis in the certificate if the designated beneficiary elects to receive annuity payments within  days of the decedents death different tax rules apply see annuity payments below for nonqualified certificates the tax treatment applicable to designated beneficiaries may be contrasted with the incometaxfree treatment applicable to persons inheriting and then selling mutual fund shares with a dateof death value in excess of their basis partial withdrawals received under nonqualified certificates prior to annuitization are first included in gross income to the extent certificate value exceeds purchase payments then to the extent the certificate value does not exceed purchase payments such withdrawals are treated as a non taxable return of principal to the certificate owner for partial withdrawals under a qualified certificate payments are treated first as a nontaxable return of principal up to the cost basis and then a taxable return of income since the cost basis of qualified certificates is generally zero partial surrender amounts will generally be fully taxed as ordinary income a certificate owner who assigns or pledges a nonqualified certificate is treated as if he or she had received the amount assigned or pledged and thus is subject to taxation under the rules applicable to partial withdrawals or surrenders a certificate owner who gives away the certificate ie transfers it without full and adequate consideration to anyone other than his or her spouse is treated for income tax purposes as if he or she had fully surrendered the certificate a special computational rule applies if keyport issues to the certificate owner during any calendar year a two or more certificates or b one or more certificates and one or more of keyports other annuity contracts under this rule the amount of any distribution includable in the certificate owners gross income is to be determined under section e of the code by treating all the keyport contracts as one contract keyport believes that this means the amount of any distribution under one certificate will be includable in gross income to the extent that at the time of distribution the sum of the values for all the certificates or contracts exceeds the sum of the cost bases for all the contracts annuity payments the nontaxable portion of each variable annuity payment is determined by dividing the cost basis of the certificate that is allocated to variable account value by the total number of expected payments while the non taxable portion of each fixed annuity payment is determined by an exclusion ratio formula which establishes the ratio that the cost basis of the certificate that is allocated to fixed account value bears to the total expected value of annuity payments for the term of the annuity the remaining portion of each payment is taxable such taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income rates for qualified certificates the cost basis is generally zero with annuity payments based on life contingencies the payments will become fully taxable once the payee lives longer than the life expectancy used to calculate the nontaxable portion of the prior payments because variable annuity payments can increase over time and because certain payment options provide for a lump sum right of commutation it is possible that the irs could determine that variable annuity payments should not be taxed as described above but instead should be taxed as if they were received under an agreement to pay interest this determination would result in a higher amount up to  of certain payments being taxable with respect to the stabilizing payment option available under annuity option  pursuant to which each annual payment is placed in keyports general account and paid out with interest in twelve equal monthly payments it is possible the irs could determine that receipt of the first monthly payout of each annual payment is constructive receipt of the entire annual payment thus the total taxable amount for each annual payment would be accelerated to the time of the first monthly payout and reported in the tax year in which the first monthly payout is received penalty tax payments received by certificate owners annuitants and designated beneficiaries under certificates may be subject to both ordinary income taxes and a penalty tax equal to  of the amount received that is includable in income the penalty tax is not imposed on amounts received a after the taxpayer attains age  b in a series of substantially equal payments made for life or life expectancy c after the death of the certificate owner or where the certificate owner is not a human being after the death of the annuitant d if the taxpayer becomes totally and permanently disabled or e under a nonqualified certificates annuity payment option that provides for a series of substantially equal payments provided only one purchase payment is made to the certificate the certificate is not issued as a result of a section  exchange and the first annuity payment begins in the first certificate year income tax withholding keyport is required to withhold federal income taxes on taxable amounts paid under certificates unless the recipient elects not to have withholding apply keyport will notify recipients of their right to elect not to have withholding apply see taxsheltered annuities tsas for an alternative type of withholding that may apply to distributions from tsas that are eligible for rollover to another tsa or an individual retirement annuity or account ira section  exchanges a nonqualified certificate may be purchased with proceeds from the surrender of an existing annuity contract such a transaction may qualify as a taxfree exchange pursuant to section  of the code it is keyports understanding that in such an event a the new certificate will be subject to the distributionatdeath rules described in death provisions for nonqualified certificates b purchase payments made between august   and january   and the income allocable to them will following an exchange no longer be covered by a grandfathered exception to the penalty tax for a distribution of income that is allocable to an investment made over ten years prior to the distribution and c purchase payments made before august   and the income allocable to them will following an exchange continue to receive the following grandfathered tax treatment under prior law i the penalty tax does not apply to any distribution ii partial withdrawals are treated first as a nontaxable return of principal and then a taxable return of income and iii assignments are not treated as surrenders subject to taxation keyports understanding of the above is principally based on legislative reports prepared by the staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation diversification standards the us secretary of the treasury has issued regulations that set standards for diversification of the investments underlying variable annuity contracts other than pension plan contracts the eligible funds are designed to be managed to meet the diversification requirements for the certificate as those requirements may change from time to time if the diversification requirements are not satisfied the certificate would not be treated as an annuity contract as a consequence to the certificate owner income earned on a certificate would be taxable to the certificate owner in the year in which diversification requirements were not satisfied including previously nontaxable income earned in prior years as a further consequence keyport would be subjected to federal income taxes on assets in the variable account the secretary of the treasury announced in september  that he expects to issue regulations which will prescribe the circumstances in which a certificate owners control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the certificate owner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets of the account the regulations could impose requirements that are not reflected in the certificate keyport however has reserved certain rights to alter the certificate and investment alternatives so as to comply with such regulations since the regulations have not been issued there can be no assurance as to the content of such regulations or even whether application of the regulations will be prospective for these reasons certificate owners are urged to consult with their own tax advisers qualified plans the certificate is designed for use with several types of qualified plans the tax rules applicable to participants in such qualified plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions of the plan itself therefore no attempt is made herein to provide more than general information about the use of the certificate with the various types of qualified plans participants under such qualified plans as well as certificate owners annuitants and designated beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights of any person to any benefits under such qualified plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves regardless of the terms and conditions of the certificate issued in connection therewith following are brief descriptions of the various types of qualified plans and of the use of the certificate in connection therewith purchasers of the certificate should seek competent advice concerning the terms and conditions of the particular qualified plan and use of the certificate with that plan taxsheltered annuities section b of the code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable educational and scientific organizations specified in section c of the code to purchase annuity contracts and subject to certain contribution limitations exclude the amount of purchase payments from gross income for tax purposes however such purchase payments may be subject to social security fica taxes this type of annuity contract is commonly referred to as a taxsheltered annuity tsa section b of the code contains distribution restrictions specifically benefits may be paid through surrender of the certificate or otherwise only a when the employee attains age  separates from service dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of section m of the code or b in the case of hardship a hardship distribution must be of employee contributions only and not of any income attributable to such contributions section b does not apply to distributions attributable to assets held as of december   thus it appears that the laws restrictions would apply only to distributions attributable to contributions made after  to earnings on those contributions and to earnings on amounts held as of  the internal revenue service has indicated that the distribution restrictions of section b are not applicable when tsa funds are being transferred taxfree directly to another tsa issuer provided the transferred funds continue to be subject to the section b distribution restrictions keyport will notify a certificate owner who has requested a distribution from a certificate if all or part of such distribution is eligible for rollover to another tsa or to an individual retirement annuity or account ira any amount eligible for rollover treatment will be subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding at a  rate if the certificate owner receives the amount rather than directing keyport by written request to transfer the amount as a direct rollover to another tsa or ira individual retirement annuities section b of the code permits eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program known as an individual retirement annuity these individual retirement annuities are subject to limitations on the amount which may be contributed the persons who may be eligible and on the time when distributions may commence in addition distributions from certain types of qualified plans may be placed on a taxdeferred basis into an individual retirement annuity corporate pension and profitsharing plans sections a and a of the code permit corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for employees such retirement plans may permit the purchase of the certificate to provide benefits under the plans deferred compensation plans with respect to service for state and local governments section  of the code while not actually providing for a qualified plan as that term is normally used provides for certain deferred compensation plans that enjoy special income tax treatment with respect to service for tax exempt organizations state governments local governments and agencies and instrumentalities of such governments the certificate can be used with such plans under such plans a participant may specify the form of investment in which his or her participation will be made however all such investments are owned by and subject to the claims of general creditors of the sponsoring employer variable account voting privileges in accordance with its view of present applicable law keyport will vote the shares of the eligible funds held in the variable account at regular and special meetings of the shareholders of the eligible funds in accordance with instructions received from persons having the voting interest in the variable account keyport will vote shares for which it has not received instructions in the same proportion as it votes shares for which it has received instructions however if the investment company act of  or any regulation thereunder should be amended or if the present interpretation thereof should change and as a result keyport determines that it is permitted to vote the shares of the eligible funds in its own right it may elect to do so the person having the voting interest under a certificate prior to the income date shall be the certificate owner the number of shares held in each sub account which are attributable to each certificate owner is determined by dividing the certificate owners variable account value in each subaccount by the net asset value of the applicable share of the eligible fund the person having the voting interest after the income date under an annuity payment option shall be the payee the number of shares held in the variable account which are attributable to each payee is determined by dividing the reserve for the annuity payments by the net asset value of one share during the annuity payment period the votes attributable to a payee decrease as the reserves underlying the payments decrease the number of shares in which a person has a voting interest will be determined as of the date coincident with the date established by the respective eligible fund for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the meeting of the fund and voting instructions will be solicited by written communication prior to such meeting in accordance with the procedures established by the eligible fund each person having the voting interest in the variable account will receive periodic reports relating to the eligible funds in which he or she has an interest proxy material and a form with which to give such voting instructions with respect to

introduction this appendix describes the fixed account option available under the certificate fixed account values provided by the certificate are subject to a market value adjustment the operation of which may result in upward or downward adjustments in amounts transferred and amounts paid including withdrawals surrenders death benefits and amounts applied to purchase annuity payments to a certificate owner or other payee in no event will the downward market value adjustment eliminate interest at the rate of  per year applied to the amount allocated to a guaranteed period payments made from fixed account values at the end of their guarantee period are not subject to the market value adjustment purchase payments allocated to the fixed account option become part of keyports general account because of applicable exemptive and exclusionary provisions interests in the fixed account options have not been registered under the securities act of   act nor is the general account an investment company under the investment company act accordingly neither the general account the fixed account option nor any interest therein is subject to regulation under the  act or the investment company act keyport understands that the securities and exchange commission has not reviewed the disclosure in the prospectus relating to the general account and the fixed account option investments in the fixed account and capital protection plus purchase payments will be allocated to the fixed account in accordance with the selection made by the certificate owner in the application any selection must specify that percentage of the purchase payment that is to be allocated to each guarantee period of the fixed account the percentage if not zero must be at least  the certificate owner may change the allocation percentages without fee penalty or other charge allocation changes must be made by written request unless the certificate owner has by written request authorized keyport to accept telephone allocation instructions from the certificate owner by authorizing keyport to accept telephone changes a certificate owner agrees to accept and be bound by the conditions and procedures established by keyport from time to time the current conditions and procedures are in appendix c and certificate owners authorizing telephone allocation instructions will be notified in advance of any changes keyport currently offers guarantee periods of    and  years keyport may change at any time the number of guarantee periods it offers under newly issued and inforce certificates as well as the length of those guarantee periods if keyport stops offering a particular guarantee period existing fixed account value in such guarantee period would not be affected until the end of the period at that time a period of the same length would not be a transfer option each guarantee period currently offered is available for initial and subsequent purchase payments and for transfers of certificate value keyport offers a capital protection plus program that a certificate owner may request under this program keyport will allocate part of the purchase payment to the guarantee period selected by the certificate owner so that such part based on that guarantee periods interest rate in effect on the date of allocation will equal at the end of the guarantee period the total purchase payment the rest of the purchase payment will be allocated to the subaccounts of the variable account based on the certificate owners allocation if any part of the fixed account value is surrendered or transferred before the end of the guarantee period the value at the end of that period will not equal the original purchase payment amount for an example of capital protection plus assume keyport receives a purchase payment of  when the interest rate for the year guarantee period is  per year keyport will allocate  to that guarantee period because  will increase at that interest rate to  after  years the remaining  of the payment will be allocated to the subaccounts selected by the certificate owner fixed account value the fixed account value at any time is equal to a all purchase payments allocated to the fixed account plus the interest subsequently credited on those payments plus b any variable account value transferred to the fixed account plus the interest subsequently credited on the transferred value less c any prior partial withdrawals from the fixed account including any charges therefor less d any fixed account value transferred to the variable account interest credits keyport will credit interest daily based on an annual compound interest rate to purchase payments allocated to the fixed account at rates declared by keyport for guarantee periods of one or more years from the month and day of allocation any rate set by keyport will be at least  per year keyports method of crediting interest means that fixed account value might be subject to different rates for each guarantee period the certificate owner has selected in the fixed account for purposes of this section variable account value transferred to the fixed account and fixed account value renewed for another guarantee period shall be treated as a purchase payment allocation application of market value adjustment any surrender withdrawal transfer or application to an annuity option of fixed account value from a guarantee period of three years or more is subject to a limited market value adjustment unless  the effective date of the transaction is at the end of the guarantee period or  the effective date of a surrender is within  days of the date of death of the first covered person to die if a market value adjustment applies to either a surrender or the application to an annuity option then any negative market value adjustment amount will be deducted from the certificate value and any positive market value adjustment amount will be added to the certificate value if a market value adjustment applies to either a partial withdrawal or a transfer then any negative market value adjustment amount will be deducted from the partial withdrawal or transfer amount after the withdrawal or transfer amount has been deducted from the fixed account value and any positive market value adjustment amount will be added to the applicable amount after it has been deducted from the fixed account value no market value adjustment is ever applicable to guarantee periods of fewer than three years effect of market value adjustment a market value adjustment reflects the change in prevailing current interest rates since the beginning of a guarantee period the market value adjustment may be positive or negative but any negative adjustment may be limited in amount see market value adjustment factor below generally if the treasury rate for the guarantee period is lower than the treasury rate for a new guarantee period with a length equal to the time remaining in the guarantee period then the application of the limited market value adjustment will result in a reduction of the amount being surrendered withdrawn transferred or applied to an annuity option similarly if the treasury rate for the guarantee period is higher than the treasury rate for a new guarantee period with a length equal to the time remaining in the guarantee period then the application of the market value adjustment will result in an increase in the amount being surrendered withdrawn transferred or applied to an annuity option the market value adjustment will be applied before the deduction of any applicable surrender charges or applicable taxes market value adjustment factor the market value adjustment is computed by multiplying the amount being surrendered withdrawn transferred or applied to a payment option by the market value adjustment factor the market value adjustment factor is calculated as the larger of formula  or   abn where a is the treasury rate for the number of guarantee period years in the guarantee period b is the treasury rate for a period equal to the time remaining rounded up to the next whole number of guarantee period years to the expiration of the guarantee period and n is the number of complete guarantee period months remaining before the expiration of the guarantee period  iyd where i is the guaranteed interest rate for the guarantee period y is the number of complete guarantee period years that have elapsed in the guarantee period d is the number of days since the last guarantee period anniversary or if y is zero the number of days since the start of the guarantee period and  is the number of days in the current guarantee period year ie the sum of d and the number of days until the next guarantee period anniversary in formulas  and  all references to guarantee period guarantee period anniversary guarantee period month and guarantee period year relate to the guarantee period from which is being taken the amount being surrendered withdrawn transferred or applied to an annuity option as stated above the formula  amount will apply only if it is greater than the formula  amount this will occur only when the formula  amount is negative and the formula  amount is a smaller negative number formula  thus ensures that a full normal negative market value adjustment of formula  will not apply to the extent it would decrease the guarantee periods fixed account value before the deduction of any applicable surrender charges or any applicable taxes below the following amount a the amount allocated to the guarantee period less b any prior systematic or partial withdrawal amounts less c any prior amounts transferred to the variable account or to another guarantee period in the fixed account plus d interest on the above items a through c credited annually at a rate of  per year treasury rates the treasury rate for a guarantee period is the interest rate in the treasury constant maturity series as published by the federal reserve board for a maturity equal to the number of years specified in a and b in formula  above weekly series are published at the beginning of the following week to determine a keyport uses the weekly series first published on or after the most recent determination date which occurs on or before the start date for the guarantee period except that if the start date is the same as the determination date or the date of publication or any date in between keyport instead uses the weekly series first published after the prior determination date to determine b keyport uses the weekly series first published on or after the most recent determination date which occurs on or before the date on which the market value adjustment factor is calculated except that if the calculation date is the same as the determination date or the date of publication or any date in between keyport instead uses the weekly series first published after the prior determination date the determination dates are the last business day prior to the first and fifteenth of each calendar month if the number of years specified in a or b is not equal to a maturity in the treasury constant maturity series the treasury rate will be determined by straight line interpolation between the interest rates of the next highest and next lowest maturities if the treasury constant maturity series becomes unavailable keyport will adopt a comparable constant maturity index or if such a comparable index also is not available keyport will replicate calculation of the treasury constant maturity series index based on us treasury security coupon rates end of a guarantee period keyport will notify a certificate owner in writing at least  days prior to the end of a guarantee period at the end of the guarantee period keyport will automatically transfer the guarantee periods fixed account value to the money market subaccount of the variable account unless keyport previously received a certificate owners written request of  election of a new guarantee period from among those being offered by keyport at that time or  instructions to transfer the ending guarantee periods fixed account value to one or more subaccounts of the variable account a new guarantee period cannot be longer than the number of years remaining until the income date transfers of fixed account value the certificate owner may transfer fixed account value from one guarantee period to another or to one or more subaccounts of the variable account subject to any applicable market value adjustment if the fixed account value represents multiple guarantee periods the transfer request must specify from which values the transfer is to be made the certificate allows keyport to limit the number of transfers that can be made in a specified time period currently keyport is limiting variable account and fixed account transfers to generally unlimited transfers per calendar year with a  per transfer dollar limit see transfer of variable account value these limitations will not apply to any transfer made at the end of a guarantee period certificate owners will be notified in advance of a change in the limitation on the number of transfers transfer requests must be by written request unless the certificate owner has authorized keyport by written request to accept telephone transfer instructions from the certificate owner or from a person acting for the certificate owner as an attorneyinfact under a power of attorney by authorizing keyport to accept telephone transfer instructions a certificate owner agrees to accept and be bound by the conditions and procedures established by keyport from time to time the current conditions and procedures are in appendix b and certificate owners authorizing telephone transfers will be notified in advance of any changes written transfer requests may be made by a person acting for the certificate owner as an attorneyinfact under a power of attorney transfer requests received by keyport before the close of trading on the new york stock exchange currently  pm eastern time will be executed at the close of business that day any requests received later will be executed at the close of the next business day the amount of the transfer will be deducted from the specified values in the manner stated in the next section below if  of a guarantee periods value is transferred and the current allocation for purchase payments includes that guarantee period then the allocation formula for future purchase payments will automatically change unless the certificate owner instructs otherwise for example if the allocation formula is  to the oneyear guarantee period and  to sub account a and all fixed account value is transferred to subaccount a the allocation formula will change to  to subaccount a appendix b telephone instructions telephone transfers of certificate values  if there are joint certificate owners both must authorize keyport to accept telephone instructions but either certificate owner may give keyport telephone instructions  all callers will be required to identify themselves keyport reserves the right to refuse to act upon any telephone instructions in cases where the caller has not sufficiently identified himselfherself to keyports satisfaction  neither keyport nor any person acting on its behalf shall be subject to any claim loss liability cost or expense if it or such person acted in good faith upon a telephone instruction including one that is unauthorized or fraudulent however keyport will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that a telephone instruction is genuine and if keyport does not keyport may be liable for losses due to an unauthorized or fraudulent instruction the certificate owner thus bears the risk that an unauthorized or fraudulent instruction that is executed may cause the certificate value to be lower than it would be had no instruction been executed  all conversations will be recorded with disclosure at the time of the call  the application for the certificate may allow a certificate owner to create a power of attorney by authorizing another person to give telephone instructions unless prohibited by state law such power will be treated as durable in nature and shall not be affected by the subsequent incapacity disability or incompetency of the certificate owner either keyport or the authorized person may cease to honor the power by sending written notice to the certificate owner at the certificate owners last known address neither keyport nor any person acting on its behalf shall be subject to liability for any act executed in good faith reliance upon a power of attorney  telephone authorization shall continue in force until a keyport receives the certificate owners written revocation b keyport discontinues the privilege or c keyport receives written evidence that the certificate owner has entered into a market timing or asset allocation agreement with an investment adviser or with a brokerdealer  telephone transfer instructions received by keyport at  before the close of trading on the new york stock exchange currently  pm eastern time will be initiated that day based on the unit value prices calculated at the close of that day instructions received after the close of trading on the nyse will be initiated the following business day  once instructions are accepted by keyport they may not be canceled  all transfers must be made in accordance with the terms of the certificate and current prospectus if the transfer instructions are not in good order keyport will not execute the transfer and will notify the caller within  hours  if  of any subaccounts value is transferred and the allocation formula for purchase payments includes that subaccount then the allocation formula for future purchase payments will change accordingly unless keyport receives telephone instructions to the contrary for example if the allocation formula is  to subaccount a and  to subaccount b and all of subaccount as value is transferred to subaccount b the allocation formula will change to  to subaccount b unless keyport is instructed otherwise telephone changes to

variable payment option the total dollar amount of each periodic payment will be equal to a the sum of all subaccount payments less b the prorata amount of the annual certificate maintenance charge the first payment for each subaccount will be determined by deducting any applicable certificate maintenance charge and any applicable state premium taxes and then dividing the remaining value of that subaccount by  and multiplying the result by the greater of a the applicable factor from the certificates annuity table for the particular payment option or b the factor currently offered by keyport at the time annuity payments begin this current factor may be based on the sex of the payee unless to do so would be prohibited by law the number of annuity units for each subaccount will be determined by dividing such first payment by the subaccount annuity unit value for the valuation period that includes the date of the first payment the number of annuity units remains fixed for the annuity payment period each subaccount payment after the first one will be determined by multiplying a by b where a is the number of subaccount annuity units and b is the subaccount annuity unit value for the valuation period that includes the date of the particular payment variable annuity payments will fluctuate in accordance with the investment results of the underlying eligible funds in order to determine how these fluctuations affect annuity payments keyport uses an annuity unit value each subaccount has its own annuity units and value per unit the annuity unit value applicable during any valuation period is determined at the end of such period when keyport first purchased eligible fund shares on behalf of the variable account keyport valued each annuity unit for each subaccount at a specified dollar amount the unit value for each subaccount in any valuation period thereafter is determined by multiplying the value for the prior period by a net investment factor this factor may be greater or less than  therefore the annuity unit may increase or decrease from valuation period to valuation period for each assumed annual investment rate air keyport calculates a net investment factor for each subaccount by dividing a by b where a is equal to the net investment factor as defined in the prospectus without any deduction for the sales charge defined in cii of the net investment factor formula and b is the assumed investment factor for the current valuation period the assumed investment factor adjusts for the interest assumed in determining the first variable annuity payment such factor for any valuation period shall be the accumulated value at the end of such period of  deposited at the beginning of such period at the assumed annual investment rate air the air for annuity units based on the certificates annuity tables is  per year  per year for oregon certificates an air of  per year is also currently available upon written request with a particular air payments after the first one will increase or decrease from month to month based on whether the actual annualized investment return of the selected subaccounts after deducting the mortality and expense risk charge is better or worse than the assumed air percentage if a given amount of subaccount value is applied to a particular payment option the initial payment will be smaller if a  air is selected instead of a  air but all other things being equal the subsequent  air payments have the potential for increasing in amount by a larger percentage and for decreasing in amount by a smaller percentage for example consider what would happen if the actual annualized investment return see the first sentence of this paragraph is    or  between the time of the first and second payments with an actual  return the  air and  air payments would both increase in amount but the  air payment would increase by a larger percentage with an actual  return the  air payment would increase in amount while the  air payment would stay the same with an actual return of  the  air payment would stay the same while the  air payment would decrease in amount finally with an actual return of  the  air and  air payments would both decrease in amount but the  air payment would decrease by a smaller percentage note that the changes in payment amounts described above are on a percentage basis and thus do not illustrate when if ever the  air payment amount might become larger than the  air payment amount note though that if option  income for a fixed number of years is selected and payments continue for the entire period the  air payment amount will start out being smaller than the  air payment amount but eventually the  air payment amount will become larger than the  air payment amount reallocating subaccount payments the number of annuity units for each subaccount under any variable annuity option will remain fixed during the entire annuity payment period unless the payee makes a written request for a change currently a payee can instruct keyport to change the subaccounts used to determine the amount of the variable annuity payments unlimited times every  months the payees request must specify the percentage of the annuity payment that is to be based on the investment performance of each subaccount the percentage for each subaccount if not zero must be at least  and must be a whole number at the end of the valuation period during which keyport receives the request keyport will a value the annuity units for each subaccount to create a total annuity value b apply the new percentages the payee has selected to this total value and c recompute the number of annuity units for each subaccount this new number of units will remain fixed for the remainder of the payment period unless the payee requests another change custodian the custodian of the assets of the variable account is state street bank and trust company a state chartered trust company its

the rankings are done on the basis of changes in accumulation unit values over time and do not take into account any charges such as sales charges or administrative charges that are deducted directly

common stocks small company stocks longterm corporate bonds long term government bonds us treasury bills and the us inflation rate historical total returns are determined by ibbotson associates for large company stocks represented by the standard and poors composite price index an unmanaged weighted index of  stocks prior to march  and  stocks thereafter of industrial transportation utility and financial companies widely regarded by investors as representative of the stock market small company stocks represented by the fifth capitalization quintile ie the ninth and tenth deciles of stocks on

by the salomon brothers longterm high grade corporate bond index which is an unmanaged index of nearly all aaa and aa rated bonds represented for  by backdating the salomon brothers index using salomon brothers monthly yield data with a methodology similar to that used by salomon brothers in computing its index and represented for  through the use of the standard and poors monthly highgrade corporate composite yield data assuming a  coupon and a year maturity longterm government bonds measured each year using a portfolio containing one us government bond with a term of approximately twenty years and a reasonably current coupon us treasury bills measured by rolling over each month a onebill portfolio containing at the beginning of each month the shortestterm bill having not less than one month to maturity inflation measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers not seasonably adjusted since january  and by the consumer price index before then the stock capital markets may be contrasted with the corporate bond and us government securities capital markets unlike an investment in stock an investment in a bond that is held to maturity provides a fixed rate of return bonds have a senior priority to common stocks in the event the issuer is liquidated and interest on bonds is generally paid by the issuer before it makes any distributions to common stock owners bonds rated in the two highest rating categories are considered high quality and present minimal risk of default an additional advantage of investing in us government bonds and treasury bills is that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and thus have virtually no risk of default although government securities fluctuate in price they are highly liquid yields for steinroe cash income subaccount yield and effective yield percentages for the steinroe cash income sub account are calculated using the method prescribed by the securities and exchange commission both yields reflect the deduction of the annual  assetbased certificate charges both yields also reflect on an allocated basis after  the certificates annual  certificate maintenance charge that is collected after the first certificate anniversary both yields do not reflect contingent deferred sales charges and premium tax charges the yields would be lower if these charges were included the following are the standardized formulas yield equals a  b   x  c  effective yield equals a  b   c where a  the accumulation unit value at the end of the day period b  hypothetical certificate maintenance charge for the day period the assumed annual steinroe cash income charge is equal to the  certificate charge multiplied by a fraction equal to the average number of certificates with steinroe cash income sub account value during the day period divided by the average total number of certificates during the day period this annual amount is converted to a day charge by multiplying it by  it is then equated to an accumulation unit size basis by multiplying it by a fraction equal to the average value of one steinroe cash income accumulation unit during the day period divided by the average certificate value in steinroe cash income subaccount during the day period c  the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the day period the yield formula assumes that the weekly net income generated by an investment in the steinroe cash income subaccount will continue over an entire year the effective yield formula also annualizes seven days of net income but it assumes that the net income is reinvested over the year this compounding effect causes effective yield to be higher than the yield for the day period ended  the yield for the steinroe cash income subaccount was  and
