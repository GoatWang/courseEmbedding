cfo anthony noto what are you doing as the companys top marketer twitter plans to roll out a campaign to win users later this year by tim peterson published on august   twitter cfo anthony noto took charge of marketing earlier this year credit abosch for twitter twitter has a fundamental problem the company has developed a product that many people love and many more people arent sure they want to use sometime later this year twitter will roll out a campaign that aims to convince the holdhouts ad age asked twitters cfo anthony noto what argument the company will make  and why the former investment banker took the marketing reins at twitter this year at all on some points mr noto wasnt quite ready to spill the interview is a bit long so you can choose whether to read the full version or a condensed version thats specific to twitters plans to hire a cmo and roll out a marketing campaign pick which version youd like to read by clicking on the buttons below the default is the long version short version long version im about to ask you a bunch of questions about twitters marketing plans but youre twitters cfo why did the guy in charge of marketing twitter to wall street become also the guy in charge of marketing twitter to normal people what id say is that dick costolo who stepped down as twitters ceo on july  and the board really wanted to elevate the importance of marketing just given where we are in the phase of our companys growth and the necessary integration that we need marketing into our other initiatives and when it came to twitter he and the board both brought me in to be the cfo but also to take on some other operating responsibilities this happened to be one area that they wanted increased elevation and leadership against i think they turned to me more from a leadership perspective than from a financial perspective frankly and the task at hand was bringing together the most important groups to build one unified consumer marketing group develop a strategy and go out and hire a worldclass cmo thats what im focused on speaking of that you said on the last earnings call that twitter is in the process of hiring a cmo has the company picked someone yet we have not were really excited about the candidates were talking to and were still in that process the delightful thing that i have found is that many of the people were talking to really think of the opportunity at twitter as a onceinalifetime opportunity i think of it as a marketers dream we have this incredibly impactful brand but a significant amount of the world still doesnt use our product seventy percent of the people still do not use twitter its an opportunity to take that great brand with all of that awareness and making it relevant and useful for everyone id love if you gave me the names of the candidates youre talking to but if not who are the types of people youre talking to cpg marketers entertainment marketers agency folks whos in this group we are talking to a wide spectrum of people with different backgrounds the things that were focused on is number one a proven leader number two is someone thats really grounded in marketing strategy number three is someone thats really taken a situation thats similar to ours in some cases and really used and developed a marketing strategy to drive business results and then of course our brand is global it is digital were a quantitativedriven company so those would be some of the characteristics that were looking for backgrounds really span industries across tech and cpg and media during twitters most recent earnings call interim ceo jack dorsey said an answer to why twitter must be articulated clearly and indicated that is the rationale behind an upcoming marketing campaign which im going to ask you about in a bit but before that in as few words as possible whats the answer to this question of why twitter weve been really focused on a couple of things to make sure we answer that question appropriately weve invested a lot of time in understanding users attitudes and behaviors and preferences and the choices that they have on a global basis in our most important markets not just in the united states because it is different by market in addition to that market research we spent a fair amount of time around our product roadmap and how we can marry making the product easier to use with marketing with content choices and media choices and communication choices and our goal is to bring the combination of those functional areas together to answer the question both from an awareness standpoint of why they should use twitter but also when that user arrives at a location they get exactly what theyre looking for and theyre incredibly satisfied we havent publicly said the answer of why twitter yet its something were still working on both from a marketing and a product standpoint why havent you publicly said it it seems like that would be important it may spoil a campaign but it still seems important if youve come up with that answer let me say slightly differently we think we have the best aggregated realtime content in the world and that allows individuals to see whats happening in the world right now to have a conversation about what they find interesting to find others that are having conversations about what they find interesting so the value of twitter is that we give people both the opportunity to find out whats happening right now but also we give them a microphone to project globally what they find of interest and their points of view and were trying to encapsulate both of those value propositions into a marketing campaign that brings that message to the masses but also brings it to the individual use cases of why people should use twitter and marry that value proposition that unique point of difference into every decision we make from product choices to content choices to media choices we understand the value of twitter its really about getting into a concise messaging and marketing campaign as opposed to figuring out why twitter we have a good sense of why twitter its really about the marketing challenge of putting it into an integrated campaign across all the various marketing outlets and making sure thats reflected in everything we do in the past that hasnt been the case youre in the process of putting together this integrated marketing campaign youve said that this will roll out by the end of this year and indicated that itll promote project lightning which is a liveevent feature twitter plans to roll out in the fall what do you have in store for the campaign our campaign will importantly answer the question for the consumer of why they should use twitter and reinforce the reasons to believe that benefit and also pay off in an emotional benefit those are some of the important foundational elements of what were doing the campaign will start largely on digital and expand from there we want to make sure were achieving the type of success that we hope to and so it will be a very methodical process in how we roll it out as we think about the different marketing vehicles that we use is there a slogan for the campaign or a name for the campaign no were not to that point yet who are the people that twitter will address with this campaign and please dont say everyone id love for you to get as specific as possible weve spent a lot of time really doing user segmentation by market in our most important markets and identifying those user segments that we can appeal to but also understanding those user segments attitudes behaviors and preferences and who they use today and whos not satisfying those preferences today one of the great opportunities that we have is we have this very high brand awareness but low penetration our objective is to get the  of the people that dont use our product but are aware of it to use it the best way to do that is identifying very specific user segments and satisfying their particular needs and use cases were not prepared to share those specific user segments or those use cases but thats the approach that were taking ninetyplus percent aided brand awareness  penetration  of those  of people that dont use it we know broadly that they dont use it because they dont know how to use it answering those questions is different for each user segment were taking that very targeted approach does that suggest that this will be more of a directresponse campaign that some big branded effort our campaign will be a branded campaign across integrated marketing channels it will rely on television it will rely on digital video its not a directresponseonly campaign it will be seeded with a core value proposition and a video campaign and itll be related to project lightning is that right we havent said what specific product that will be marketed with a campaign we have a significant roadmap that will roll out over the next  months project lightning happens to be one of the opportunities to marry the marketing the product and the content and deliver on that messaging you had said during the most recent earnings call that there will be an integrated marketing campaign tied to project lightning could there be two campaigns in the near future from twitter one for twitter overall and another specifically for project lightning let me clarify there will be one campaign that will apply to project lightning but it will apply to other product initiatives as well the users that twitter is going after are the more mainstream users how do you market to this audience without alienating the power users already on twitter the power users already on twitter have already found the value of twitter and have already answered the question of why twitter their experience will be the same if not improved we think we can serve both audiences very well the product experiences for one do not have to come at the expense of the other theres enough surface area within the product to meet both of those users needs and the marketing message would resonate with the heavy users just like it would with nonusers they just have already found the value on their own so it will be less impactful because theyre already using the product an analyst during the last earnings call said that more than  billion people have created twitter accounts over the years  or maybe more accurately more than  billion twitter accounts have been created over the years  but twitter only counts around  million monthly active users what specifically is the plan to win back these potentially hundreds of millions of people that have tried twitter and quit twitter a couple things one our product has evolved over time and those that tried our product in   if our marketing message could bring them back today they would see all the changes that weve made since  plus what were making today if you came to twitter in  you couldnt see or upload photos or videos you couldnt follow conversations easily and if you didnt follow anyone right away you had no content today when you come to twitter all of those experiences are there and they provide a great use case today but were not stopping there were continuing to evolve the product to make it easier for the individual to understand the language of twitter and hashtags and atmessages and favorites and replies and retweets and evolve the product so that the individual that doesnt understand all of those things can show up looking for the content that weve marketed to them and theyre in an immersive experience of that content that weve communicated to them that they can find on twitter thats the next important evolution for the campaign and the marketing strategy as a whole what kind of research have you done to make sure the campaign hits on the pain points for normal people as opposed to it being created in a bubble we will do all the typical marketing research steps that you would with any campaign from brand recall and attribute measurements and association and consideration weve already done a fair amount of research prior to building the campaign but as we build the campaign we will go through all the gates and checks that someone thats been marketing for hundreds of years will go through were working with agencies that have great experience and were working with a team here that has a significant amount of experience with all of the appropriate marketresearch tests that you would do to validate the messaging the brand recall and the association with the brand speaking of the research what have you found out so far in the terms of the campaign thats not something where were far enough down the path to share that with you yet what are the agencies youre working with and im curious if jack dorseys agency west is in that group in terms of agencies i dont want to share that yet jack before becoming interim ceo marketing was a big focus of his he was a key decisionmaker in elevating marketing within the company and with it coming under my leadership since hes become ceo hes become intimately involved with the process that were going through its something he has a great passion for and interest in as do i and ive enjoyed the chance to work with him on it directly its been a great experience to have him involved going back to the pending cmo hire it sounds like twitters big campaign will have already been in development if not launched by the time the cmo joins will that limit or otherwise affect what that person can do in setting twitters marketing strategy absolutely not marketing is a constantly improving discipline and function and theres continuous feedback that allows you to improve marketing both your strategy and your execution were moving aggressively on hiring a cmo my hope is that theyre here while were actually in the development phase and the creation phase but ultimately the question of why twitter is one that is going to be an evolving marketing process i alluded to earlier were going to do this in a methodical way to make sure were on the right path to get the types of benefits that were setting out as objectives and i think theyll be here to impact it in a significant way and continue to work with our team in evolving it to getting to the point that its worldclass and i think thats a neverending process whats the timeline for when the cmo will be hired and then when the campaign will go live we havent share specifics on either were moving as fast as we can on the cmo search im encouraged where we are and the quality of people that we have and were still in the process so if there are others that want to raise their hand wed love to talk to them we want to find the best person for twitter in this article

mattlynley  shares next story shopify ceo attempts to defend continued hosting of breitbart’s online store twitter’s advertising business is stalling but the company is trying to focus on some flashes of improvement among the service — which it’s attributing to product changes and not just to major events like presidential debates or the president’s usage of twitter there were some questions as to whether president donald trump’s usage of twitter would be something that would a big driver for twitter’s growth — along with the heavy usage of twitter throughout the us presidential election an event like the election is essentially twitter’s sweet spot and twitter’s usage among events is something that you’d expect to be a core part of the company’s growth and business despite this cfo anthony noto said the majority of twitter’s usage improvements came from product changes and marketing and that those events and people weren’t the primary drivers twitter’s monthly active users count rose by  million and twitter said its daily active user growth is accelerating its daus are up  yearoveryear total ad engagements grew  yearoveryear the company said so there appears to be some signs that twitter is starting to find new areas of growth amid all this twitter said it’s reassessing its advertising products to emphasize the ones that are performing best and growing “i would say is that the president’s use of twitter has broadened the awareness of how the platform can be used and it shows the power of twitter” noto said “when he tweets it sparks conversation and discussion so at a macro level discussions on a platform really helps us be the best at showing what’s happening in the world and where discussion strengthens our key differentiators and comprehensiveness fast from a quantitative perspective what i’d say is each quarter we measure and analyze factors that drive causal growth in the audience not coincident growth in the fourth quarter the primary driver of our growth was as i said earlier product changes and marketing” diving deeper into that noto is essentially saying that it’s important to have these people on twitter because it drives people to pay attention to the platform and use it to gather that news and conversation as it breaks on twitter but twitter still has to provide a positive experience for its users and keep them on the service beyond just seeing the occasional tweet and twitter has been notoriously seen as somewhat slowmoving in the product category only recently starting to address things like abuse and harassment problems through product changes related articles jack dorsey says hell continue running both square and twitter twitters advertising business is stalling twitters head of diversity is leaving and its chief hr officer has already left twitter rolls out changes to silence abuse on its service “as it relates to impressions growth which is another area we look at as i mentioned earlier the magnitude of the impressions platform is so large it would be very hard for an event or a single person to drive sustained growth and impressions growth” noto said “all of that said having the world’s leaders on our platform talking about global issues people being passionately expressing their points of view that’s all positive or twitter and that’s what we’re focused on so anytime that we can drive faster distribution of content more comprehensive content more discussion or more personalization we’re better at delivering what’s happening in the world and what’s being talked about” while the company saw a lift in tweet impressions noto said it would be hard to assume that single major events would be the primary driver in the net increase in overall impressions the company still touts its events — like its deals to broadcast nfl games and major political events like the inauguration — but even the sum of these products requires a good overall experience beyond just people coming to watch them on twitter instead of somewhere else “i think i’ve talked in the past about even on nights of the presidential debates we would have like a  lift in tweet impressions” noto said “and even if i assume all of that lift is incremental it only could translate into a  lift in impressions for the entire quarter so to get doubledigit growth for an entire quarter in impressions for  quarters in a row takes a fundamental change and that’s being driven by machine learning in the timeline it’s being driven by better notifications from a relevant content and all the things that twitter ceo jack dorsey talked about the other measure that we look at because we do have a significant amount of video on the platform and that continues to increase is user active minutes and that also has been up double digits so we’re really encouraged by the outputs but the inputs are really the product changes that are driving those engagement trends”  shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase

product by nitasha tiku may   pm edt share tweet linkedin brian achgetty images as an investment banker at goldman sachs anthony noto orchestrated twitters initial public offering now noto is twitters chief financial officer and hes changing the score again moving the social networks hapless marketing department under his control marketing is not typically the purview of a cfo and a source familiar with the situation told the verge that the unusual structure was discussed in a meeting at twitter headquarters monday noto is consolidating power so to speak the source said during the dotcom bubble noto hyped troubled tech stocks like etoys and webvan these days hes better known as the twitter exec whose direct message fail exposed a planned acquisition and who later had his twitter account hacked regardless noto is rewarded handsomely for his services in  he received a  million compensation package mostly in stock taking home roughly three times more than his predecessor charged with boosting user growth last week noto costarred with ceo dick costolo on the earnings call delivering bad news to shareholders twitter has been fending off wall streets unhappiness with slower growth to its user base the latest quarterly report showed that twitters revenue growth also slowed failing to meet expectations the bad quarter which caused a steep drop in the companys stock price reignited speculation that costolos job could be in jeopardy noto heads up several areas beyond finance including corporate development corporate strategy and real estate he took over marketing after months of fruitless searching for a chief marketing officer since january marketing has fallen under the auspices of kevin weil senior vice president of product before that marketing was led by chief communications officer gabriel sticker taking over at a key time noto takes over marketing at a key time twitter desperately needs to be able to explain itself to the masses given the companys challenges with user growth it does not bode well for the company that it keeps tossing the mic when longtime employee gabriel stricker expanded his role to vp of marketing and communications in  all things d wrote historically twitter hasn’t had a solid unified consumer marketing team or a person to lead it for years pam kramer did a short stint as vp of marketing back in  but it didn’t work out so well kramer was shown the door after only three months strickers bio on twitters executive team page says hes now the chief communications officer theres no mention of marketing on the entire page except to note that stricker is the author of the bestselling book on guerrilla marketing mao in the boardroom the search for a cmo has dragged on for months and is still ongoing according to one source kate jhaveri senior director of consumer marketing at twitter was passed over for the chief marketing role despite the fuss twitter made over poaching her from facebook where she led consumer branding and mobile marketing for three years the source told the verge jhaveri plans to resign but she is still with the company she did not respond to requests for comment a senior director was passed over for the job the exodus of executives from twitter has been an ongoing saga the most tumultuous recent departure was chief operating officer ali rowghani who resigned last june after a dispute with ceo dick costolo if jhaveri leaves though that will be at least the fourth highlevel female leader to leave twitter in the past  months that group includes vivian schiller twitters head of news who split with the company in october after just  months schiller the former ceo of npr who held top roles at nbc news and the new york times digital was a highprofile hire in february april underwood director of product departed the company chloe sladden twitters vice president of media left last august the women may be done with twitter but they still enjoy working together in march four current and two former female twitter employees launched an investment group for investing in earlystage startups called angels the same month a former female software engineer named tina huang filed a classaction lawsuit against twitter for gender discrimination alleging that the companys process for promoting employees favors men and the hiring process is controlled by largely male upper management notos first task may be figuring out how to market himself a little better at the office the same source told the verge twitter employees are asking why noto gets  million but the company can’t afford to give raises or bring salaries closer to market rates although engineers make around market rate the source said nontechnical employees do not if you have additional information about
