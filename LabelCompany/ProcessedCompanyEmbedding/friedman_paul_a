hair nails tools  accessories men a b c d e f g h i j k l m n m o p q r s t u v w x y z dermatologist dr paul friedman gives advice on how to choose the right skin care product published  by ines markovic in skin care how many times did you find yourself in a drugstore or surfing the internet in search of a skin care product and after buying and trying it you realized that your skin doesnt like it to avoid that from happening once again read dr paul friedmans useful advices on how to pick the right skin care productaccording to dermatologist dr paul friedman “the skin care market is full of products that can help improve challenged skin but many of my patients experience frustration with an oversaturated beauty market” here are some of the most common “beauty blunders” when it comes to buying and using consumer skin care products if you have acneprone skin avoid buying lotions that come in a jar or pot says dr friedman dipping your fingers into lotions every day introduces bacteria to the entire jar and that can translate onto your skin causing breakouts or infections ask for recommendations but proceed with caution the old adage went if you see a woman with great hair ask where she had it done the same can be applied to skin care – ask a friend what kind of moisturizer she likes and you might find your new favorite product but keep in mind skin care is a unique experience what works for some does not work for all if you are buying environmentally friendly products watch out for those that are “paraben free” parabens have been singled out as potentially dangerous chemicals but what most consumers don’t know is they are included in skincare items for a reason – to help them last longer most parabenfree products will spoil after a certain timeframe which is usually listed on the package pay attention to this date and treat it almost like a food item says dr friedman you don’t need an “arsenal” of products to look your best many skin care companies sell their products in a series or grouping according to dr friedman most women only need a gentle cleanser daily moisturizer with spf of  or higher and a moisturerich night cream to maintain a healthy complexion read the back of the labels many products contain irritants like added fragrances or alcohols that can dry the skin no matter what a package promises on the front read the back carefully to ensure you are getting what’s advertised if you have skin sensitivities towards certain foods it is also important to look for essential oils which are often derived from foods that can cause allergies in some people don’t be fooled by clever marketing terminology product packaging is usually designed to do one thing sell the product dr friedman says the last thing you should look for in a product is an appealing design be wary of claims like “dermatologist tested” or “allergy tested” these phrases often carry little meaning watch where you store your skin care different types of products such as gels may have temperature requirements in order to stay effective notes dr friedman leaving products in direct sunlight in extreme heat or cold could also affect their performance if there are no directions dr friedman notes products should be kept in cool dry areasand remember the more you educate yourself the better your chances are of finding a skin care routine that works for you about dr paul friedmanpaul m friedman md is boardcertified by the american board of dermatology specializing in dermatologic laser surgery and mohs micrographic surgery he

philosophy purity made simple micellar cleansing water in skin care interview paul friedman – ceo incyte  mpnforum magazine mpnforum magazine crispr madness a day at the office — mpnrf about mpnforum international mpn news science  opinion interview paul friedman – ceo incyte the bottom line … drug discovery and development we think of it as the product of brilliant scientific minds and skilled bench chemists maybe but the driving force in these highstakes gambles to bring a compound to market is located far from the lab and gene sequencing equipment the action is in plush corporate boardrooms last month flush with cash and awash in operating losses incyte corp incy nasdaq elbowed aside both little biotechs and giant drug companies as it took the lead in fielding the first therapeutic drug for treatment of myelofibrosis both in the us where it’s going it alone and in the rest of the world where it teamed up with big pharma novartis – which took a share of the action by plunking down  million up front and providing milestone payments that could exceed  billion — incyte has pulled out all the stops in its drive to market  the result ruxolitinib the very first drug proven effective against splenomegaly and the worst of mf symptoms in controlled clinical trial is poised to take the lion’s share of the mf market estimated at several hundred million dollars with anticipated expansion to polycythemia vera and other blood disorders revenues could exceed  billion over the next few years there are hurdles ahead fda approval while anticipated for december of this year is by no means assured and then there are competing existing therapies like revlimid hydroxyurea pegasys…and new drugs in clinical trial rumored to have fewer side effects notably ymi’s cytopia  which has reported similar results plus an effect on anemia and then there are radically different mono and combination therapies emerging from the genetics labs in this fast moving competitive pipeline once past those hurdles incyte which holds a long lead over the rest of the field faces the marketing and distribution battle for clinical acceptance rolling the dice in this megamillion dollar gamble is incyte president and ceo paul a friedman md friedman formerly a professor of medicine and pharmacology at harvard medical school was president of dupont pharmaceutical research labs before taking over as incyte ceo in  and standing around the table are thousands of myelofibrosis patients and caregivers whose bottom line is not at all complicated is there a ruxo prescription pill in our near future that will improve our condition while we wait for the silver bullet that will stop mf in its tracks a week after ruxo was formally unveiled in chicago to the america society of clinical oncologists we talked to dr friedman participating were pamela m murphy vice president corporate communications amd zhenya senyak for mpnforum this is the transcript of that interview  forum i’d like to talk to you as an mf patient from that perspective our concerns or hopes that  will help relieve the worst of the symptoms pf ok forum as i understand it now ruxolitinib…where does that name come from pam –the nib is part of the kinase nomenclature ruxo is a product of our team and got approved pf the generic names are tongue twisters at best we call it ruxo  forum as i understand it now while effective in reducing spleen size it’s not going to slow the progression of the disease i have no information on the reduction of the jak allele burden and i think it may contribute to anemia as well as thrombocytopenia platelet destruction as well as blood transfusion requirements pf you make it sound some something no one would want to take forum believe me i would want to take it if needed pf ok all those things are true but out of context and so we should probably take them one at a time neither study was big enough or lasted long enough to be statistically powered to show a survival benefit there was no way to show any kind for survival benefit that would be statistically meaningful in either pivotal trial if you look at the deaths in both trials the data favors ruxo but it’s not close to being a p value of less than  in both studies what’s called the hazard ratio was between  and  in favor of ruxo arms where ruxo was administered so we will not have a claim for survival and i certainly cannot tell you unequivocally that there is a survival advantage but if you think about the following in causes of death with mf only  percent are conversions to aml and many more are from complications of the disease other than transformation and when you think about what some of those things are you might think that a drug that appears to do what ruxo does could benefit people in that regard and so since we’re anticipating the drugs approval and once it gets approval it would be impossible to do a prospective placebo involved trial to evaluate survival we have to use some kind of surrogate way of looking at what data we have  and dr verstovsek at md anderson and one of his colleagues in italy is attempting to do that in the longer term data we have in the phase ii study that continues to run with some patients being on the drug for four years or more and when you look at that data and compare it to … a control group of demographically matched patients the data is intriguing and suggestive of survival benefit but we will not have a claim for that from the phase iii data just have to watch as dr verstovsek and dr passamonti’s data matures from phase ii to see how convincing the early intriguing results are so that’s what i would say about your first statement the second one is there are symptoms that are related to the spleen depending on how big the spleen gets and there are symptoms that are related to the proinflammatory cytokines that mf patients often have like interleukin  and by inhibiting the janus kinases  and  we have a dramatic effect on spleen size with relief of symptoms that appear to be related completely or in part to big spleens and very rapid and dramatic and durable relief from symptoms that are due to the over active proinflammatory cytokine pathways such as fatigue night sweats weight loss poor appetite bone pain etc you are right in inhibiting jak you can cause bone marrow suppression so the way we’ve gone about running the clinical trials and the way we think the label will read allows for the individual physician  live please help us narrow down your search all states alabama alaska arizona arkansas
