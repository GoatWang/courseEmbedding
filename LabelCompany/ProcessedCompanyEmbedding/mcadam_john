pushing product development to get as many of those out as possible and they’ve delivered” the seattlebased company last quarter and this will release “as many products as it has during my entire time here” he said mcadam served as ceo for  years then retired in july  — only to return in middecember upon the sudden and unexpected departure of his successor manny rivelo since his return “things have improved dramatically including the morale” he said the company posted solid quarterly results today beating its own goals to deliver revenue of 9 million and net income of  9 million or  per
