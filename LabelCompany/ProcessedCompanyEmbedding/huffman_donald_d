dimension of depth to the flat image at your eye but this means that you construct all the depth you see around you you use motion and shading and stereo and other forms of information to construct a world with depth i study how you do this using several research methods i build computational theoriesmathematical models which can do the same kind of depth construction that you do i prove theorems about their performance their strengths and weaknesses i implement them in computer programs that in effect endow the computer with the ability to see depth i then compare the performance of these programs and the predictions of the mathematical theorems against the performance of human subjects in controlled visual experiments i also compare them with what is known of the neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of the human visual system the programs and mathematical models motivate new experiments the experiments in turn suggest new mathematical models in that interplay of theory and experiment
