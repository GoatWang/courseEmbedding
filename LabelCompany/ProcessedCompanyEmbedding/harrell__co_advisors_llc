employeeowned company  pilot hill advisors jump to navigation harrell remodeling a leading employeeowned company release date palo alto calif feb   prnewswire  harrell remodeling inc a leading design and build remodeling firm headquartered in palo alto ca has earned the accreditation of being named a certified employeeowned business by san franciscobased certified eo announced ciro giammona ceo of harrell remodelingview photosharrell remodeling is a  percent employeeowned firm to be recognized as a successful and dedicated employeeowned business is a very important distinction not only for our  employeeowners but also for our many bay area remodeling clients who value working with harrell remodeling and appreciate our focus on creating a sustainable business model where everyone in the company is an owner becoming certified by certified eo is a huge recognition of our commitment to that principle said giammonaharrell remodeling created its employee stock ownership program esop in  as a method to allow their staff to garner ownership shares through company contributions with no outofpocket expense to the employees in addition many business experts believe the esop is one of the best strategies to extend the legacy of a firm by broadening the ownership structurewhen esops started they were designed for manufacturing firms but as our economy transitions into a servicebased economy esops fit really well within industries like remodeling says john menke president and ceo of san francisco based menke group one of the oldest esop advisory firms in the nation at a time when so much of our nations wealth is concentrated among so few the esop is one of the best ways to reverse this trend adds menke who coauthored the original esop legislationaccording to giammona the certified eo designation is also relevant to the firms bay area clients who recognize the significance of being employeeowned and value detailed craftsmanship that is performed by skilled professionals who also are the face of ownershipthere is also something else that happens internally with an employeeowned company there is a dedication to success and as a result each member of our team works with a higher ideal said giammonato become certified by certified eo employeeowned companies must first complete a detailed questionnaire that covers all aspects of the firms ownership structure after that a series of interviews take place followed by a thorough audit of the companys legal paperwork and trust documentsobviously becoming a certified employeeowned company is no small task but the accomplishment is quickly becoming a mark of distinction throughout the united statesit is a rigorous process we really get into the guts of the process because thats where we see the value of our certification said certified eos cofounder thomas dudley when you see a usda organic sticker that means that a qualified thirdparty went to the farm and spent the time to thoroughly look at their organic protocols and how they were implementing them thats what we are doing for the ownership of companiesaccording to dudley a phd student in organizational behavior from stanford university his company performed studies that demonstrate there was a  percent more likelihood of consumers patronizing an employeeowned firm than that of a sole proprietor or publicly owned company
