corporate governance stock information stock quote stock chart historical price lookup news releases calendar of events sec filings investor faqs presentations online investor kit request information contact generx biology  delivery adfgf construct car receptorbinding for localized cardiac transfection fgf – the therapeutic growth factor generx is an adenovector serotype  dnabased gene therapy construct that encodes the fibroblast growth factor fgf gene in transfected heart cells using cardium’s proprietary methods of gene therapy generx drives the cellular production of fgf a secreted protein that activates other angiogenic growth factor pathways such as vegf pdgf hgf and nitric oxide indicating that it is high in the hierarchical control of the angiogenic cascade companysponsored research demonstrated that generx has the capacity to promote and enhance cardiac microvascular circulation through both the enlargement of preexisting collateral arterioles arteriogenesis and the formation of new capillary vessels angiogenesis taxus cardium has developed a new and unique in vitro angiogenesis bioassay that provides a valuable tool for demonstrating the proangiogenic potency of generx this assay quantifies two key biological activities the dosedependent release of the fgf protein from adfgf transfected cells the ability of the released fgf in the “conditioned” transfected cell culture media to promote endothelial tube formation angiogenesis when added to a second coculture containing human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs and human dermal fibroblasts hdf innovative generx intracoronary delivery generx is designed to bind to cell surface coxsackievirusadenovirus receptors that are abundant in the heart and accessed using the company’s proprietary ischemiadriven method of gene therapy lessons learned from the extensive preclinical and clinical experience with generx include the finding that induction of transient ischemia during intracoronary generx administration together with the introduction of nitroglycerin significantly facilitates the transfection of generx into heart cells by several mechanisms including enhanced penetration through microvessel endothelium and upregulation of coxsackieadenovirus receptor cari taxus cardium has therefore developed an innovative proprietary method for generx delivery which combines antegrade intracoronary artery delivery during transient balloon occlusion of a coronary artery producing transient myocardial ischemia and concomitant infusion of nitroglycerin all of which can be safely applied by interventional cardiologists onetime treatment via a nonsurgical delivery by intracoronary administration by interventional cardiologist during angiography procedure utilizes standard balloon catheter which can be easily integrated into diagnostic angiography procedures or with other percutaneous coronary interventions new induced transient ischemia  reperfusion techniques designed to enhance dna uptake and fgf expression in the heart  administered to right coronary circulation and  to left coronary circulation i shi et al hum gene ther methods   contact information taxus
