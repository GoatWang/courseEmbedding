sylla of allstate financial group with casey j sylla of allstate financial group jul     am by gary s mogel casey j syllas mission is to get insurance and other financial products out of allstates good hands and into the hands of clients via the companys marketing channels  agents brokerdealers and banks the 6yearold executive is chairman and president of allstate financial group the insurance and investment marketing arm of northbrook illbased allstate corpcasey is a wonderful partner and mentor he excels at building relationships with people said melissa gaustad chief marketing officer and senior vice president of us bancorp investments inc in st paul minn which distributes allstate products he has a way of pulling people together and making them feel valuedcasey is a very smart individual and adroit businessman said frank keating chief executive of the american council of life insurers in washington he is a tremendous advocate for the life insurance industry ive seen him at work walking the halls of congress he is knowledgeable and personable providing the industry with topflight representation q how have allstates marketing and distribution methods evolved in recent yearsa we have made a major commitment to nonproprietary distribution approximately 5 of our current business comes from our allstate agencies the remainder comes from our bank brokerdealer and independentagency channelsq what types of products are being sold through the various channelsa the banks have been primarily a fixedannuity channel for us but that is changing we are now selling more variable annuities and singlepremium life insurance products through banks banks appear to be comfortable with singlepremium productsthe brokerdealer channel used to be primarily a variable annuity channel but is also diversifying into fixed annuities our independent agents concentrate primarily on life insurance fixed annuities and equityindexed annuitiesq have there been any special challenges or frustrations in obtaining business through the bank channela the nature of bank customers is that they mainly want mortgages savings products checking accounts and other typical services from their banks they appear to be more conservative and they like products with guaranteed features they do not appear willing to purchase products that do not fit their risk profile providing them with a measure of safety is the key to getting their business as banks continue to build the skill sets of their financial representatives they will start selling a broader range of products to their customersq what are you telling financial advisers to concentrate on when developing retirement and insurance programs for clientsa when i speak with producers i point out that there will be a tidal wave of  to  million people from the baby boomer generation entering retirement during the next  years and that many are financially unprepared for retirement there will also be the largest generational wealth transfer in history from this generation presenting an opportunity for advisers to develop financial products to fund clients retirement and help them transfer assets to their heirsat the same time many employers are opting out of their defined benefit pension plans opening the door for advisers to provide other forms of retirement savings for clients in addition to all of this the viability of the social security and medicare systems is uncertain so privatesector solutions are neededq where are variable annuity sales headeda there has been some slowdown in sales due to the bad press variable annuities have received but the va market is still strong and evolving much depends on the performance of the stock market if you dont have reasonable growth in equity valuations in the future vas will become less attractiveq what can be done to control variable annuity sales abuses such as inappropriate va sales to seniorsa better screening and internal sales procedures by producers brokerdealers have their own compliance units and we work in concert with the compliance officers of the bds as well as those in the bank channelq ive heard some say that variable annuities offer too many guarantees and that their core purpose has been lost do you agreeathere have been a lot of bells and whistles added in an attempt at oneupmanship by the insurance industry from the consumers perspective va products have become very difficult to understand at allstate we try to be forthright in what we do and not be product pushers we believe in a needsbased selling approach and have sales tools that help producers screen customers who are candidates for vasq what are some of the mistakes that insurers have made with their sales channelsa not helping the producers do their jobs and not making it easy for them to conduct their business producers need more than just product descriptions  insurance companies have to provide them with sales and marketing tools they need help in building their client service capabilities and their brand as well as in offering the right product to the right customer at the right priceq how have life insurance sales fared recently in the various distribution channelsa life insurance is always a difficult sale because people dont believe that they will die prematurely they know that they have to buy auto insurance but they dont think that they have to buy life insurance they would rather contemplate the investment issues related to living too long than the insurance issues of dying too soon the bottom line is that many people are woefully underinsured and that creates opportunities for salesthe brokerdealer and bank channels sometimes struggle with life insurance sales because the process takes a lot of time its a holistic discussion of individual and family needs some producers in these channels have a transaction orientation  they prefer to sell mutual funds fixed annuities and other products that take less timeon the other hand the agents are used to the more involved sales process and are stronger at selling life insurance productsq what are your predictions for the future of the life insurance industrya im optimistic about the future due to the tremendous opportunities presented by the needs of all the people who are preparing for retirement on the other hand intense competition in the industry will put pressure on returns that will probably lead to more consolidation in order to survive and retain clients companies will have to have scale and sell multiple products across
