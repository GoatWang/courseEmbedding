governance profile stock info regulatory filings faq investor relations vitality biopharma “vitality” otcqb vbio is a cure development company dedicated to unlocking the power of cannabinoid “prodrugs” as a means to treat serious neurological and inflammatory disorders we are interested in drug approvals first and foremost but our overarching mission is to improve the lives of patients afflicted with devastating neurological and inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease narcotic bowel syndrome and multiple sclerosis  in our programs we aim to go beyond merely providing symptomatic relief to patients afflicted with these disorders and to instead provide targeted therapies that can provide longterm or durable relief as well as even help them recover lost function prodrugs are medications or compounds that after administration are converted within the body into a pharmacologically active drug which may already have a long history of clinical investigation and use because the reference drug already has independent verification of its safety and efficacy some prodrugs may be approved rapidly through demonstrating similar bioavailability or bioequivalence  at the same time a prodrug can be far more marketable due to its ability to eliminate unwanted side effects or undesirable commercial aspects  in our case targeted delivery could enable oral drug formulations of cannabinoids that provide therapeutic benefits while reducing or avoiding the systemic delivery of thc into the bloodstream  a classic prodrug example is aspirin acetylsalicylic acid which was first made by felix hoffmann at bayer in  and is a synthetic prodrug of salicylic acid  as of  there were approximately  prodrugs that had been classified as blockbusters defined as having annual sales in excess of  billion one of the most hotly pursued cannabinoids for pharmaceutical purposes is cannabidiol which is nonpsychotropic and has demonstrated therapeutic effects in clinical trials for serious neurological conditions including rare seizure disorders and for alleviating symptoms of multiple sclerosis our prodrugs could exert the same beneficial therapeutic effects but with notable improvements such as a better tasting formulation that enables improved patient compliance better oral bioavailability that provides safer and more reliable dosing or a delayed release mechanism that enables patients using these medications to have longlasting overnight relief given that we have recently filed intellectual property applications including strong composition of matter claims for more than  cannabinoid prodrugs including versions of thc cbd and cbdv we have demonstrated the ability to create a proprietary prodrug of every significant cannabinoid pharmaceutical available today get in touch  contact vitality biopharma stocks index  markets index bulletin investor alert stocks rates funds bonds benchmarks real estate

proprietary information and research they have hired excellent people in recent months to help them realize the creation and the successful marketing of cannabinoidbased medical drugs their chances of success have greatly increased in recent months yet they continue to try to pump up their share price with crudely worded paid press releases that make them look bad to even the modestly sophisticated investor still the share price has remained level why because the impartial investor recognizes the immense potential of the company to generate huge profits within the next  years i just wish robert

more than  novel cannabinoid glycosides or “cannabosides” which are novel drug candidates that represent a new class of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals it is well established that cannabis can provide relief of pain and inflammation in certain disease indications and our prodrugs could exert the same beneficial therapeutic effects but with notable improvements such as targeted drug delivery that avoids or reduces psychoactivity targeted delivery through glycosylation may enable selective delivery of compounds to the brain or gut markedly improving the side effect profile or bioavailability of existing drugs vitality has filed intellectual property applications and is seeking worldwide patent protection through  with strong composition of matter claims for prodrugs of thc cbd and cbdv as

prodrug pharmaceuticals and to unlocking the power of cannabinoids for the treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory disorders today announced results of recent drug formulation studies that documented substantial modifications to key physiochemical properties of cannabinoids through the production of cannaboside prodrug pharmaceuticals vitality biopharma has demonstrated through internal drug formulation studies that cannabosides have versatile physical properties enabling various compounds to be produced as liquids solids powders as well as foams the most convenient method of delivering pharmaceuticals is through oral delivery and most oral cannabinoid medicinal products today must be delivered using oilbased liquid solutions or sprays because cannabinoid oils often include harsh organic solvents such as ethanol and propylene glycol they can act as irritants when used repeatedly this limits the amount of cannabinoids that can be delivered orally and also reduces product appeal especially for pediatric applications vitalitys formulations now deliver water solubility documented as high as mgml or roughly  of the masstovolume ratio which represents more than a fold improvement over the reported water solubility of most cannabinoids such as thc and cannabidiol cbd this improved solubility represents a novel ability to produce concentrated liquid cannabinoid solutions that can be delivered orally for maximum convenience and further it enables alternative methods of administration such as topical rectal or intravenous drug formulations a primary target of cannaboside prodrugs is for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease an autoimmune condition where an individuals immune system attacks their intestines rectum and other parts of their digestive tract this disease afflicts  million americans and often affects children with most patients receiving their diagnosis prior to age  as with epilepsy dramatic clinical trial results have been documented through the use of cannabinoids including an ability to induce remission of crohns disease large statefunded and independentlymanaged clinical trials are now underway to further document and analyze these therapeutic effects and many states have now approved medical marijuana for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease including colorado california ohio and more than a dozen others vitality biopharmas cannabinoid prodrugs enable the targeted delivery of cannabinoids directly to the site of disease enabling larger drug concentrations to be used while simultaneously reducing or avoiding psychoactivity altogether this could lead to their widespread use as pharmaceuticals that provide the same therapeutic benefits as medical marijuana or more and yet do so without

the fight against the increasing epidemic of prescription painkiller related deaths in his article mr brooke notes opiates are one of the key classes of drugs were seeking to replace or to make far less necessary as our proprietary cannabosides could provide a potent alternative form of pain relief and help avoid or greatly reduce the use of opiates for the treatment of many conditions including inflammatory bowel disease where  of patients now regularly receive opiates upon hospitalization the statistics are startling as last year there were  americans that died from drug overdoses and opioids were involved in  of these cases since  the rates of drugoverdose deaths have exceeded the number of deaths from car accidents this is not uniquely an american problem but the us uses an astonishing  of the worlds opioids while representing only  of the worlds population the new england journal of medicine has just written that the rising death toll has been rivaled in modern history only by that at the peak of the aids epidemic in the early s on friday the washington post reported that an arizonabased maker of fentanyl the drug most commonly reported in many of these deaths just donated  to oppose legalization of medical marijuana this at a time when studies have shown that today about  to  of heroin users started with prescription opioid pain relievers so the first exposure

selective delivery of thc and cannabidiol cbd to the gastrointestinal tract sitespecific delivery could enable oral drug formulations of cannabinoids to provide therapeutic benefits while reducing or avoiding the systemic delivery of thc into the bloodstream currently high concentrations of psychoactive thc in the brain limit the dose of cannabinoids that can be used elsewhere in the body for treatment of pain and inflammation independent clinical trial results suggest that cannabinoids will help induce remission in crohn’s disease patients and that the vast majority of inflammatory bowel disease patients experience symptomatic relief including more than  of patients who report improvement in visceral pain and abdominal cramping approximately  million americans are affected by inflammatory bowel diseases including crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis most patients are diagnosed before age  and require lifelong treatment in addition to providing targeted delivery cannabosides could enable a better tasting formulation for improved patient compliance better oral bioavailability that provides safer and more reliable dosing and a delayed release mechanism that enables patients using these medications to have longlasting overnight relief a prodrug is a medication or compound that after administration is metabolized ie converted within the body into a pharmacologically active drug prodrugs are often designed to improve bioavailability when a drug itself is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or to overcome other issues that make molecules unappealing candidates for future development efforts a prodrug may for instance be used to selectively target a specific tissue or organ such as the brain or gut which enables the drug to have a more targeted effect prodrugs have been around for a while with aspirin acetylsalicylic acid first made by felix hoffmann at bayer in  a classic example of a synthetic prodrug of salicylic acid

pharmaceutical industry that glycosylation could act to generate new natural product libraries with improved drug properties this process for modifying natural products to make them more useful is often called glycorandomization or glycodiversification using the same technology we’ve now been able to produce and characterize more than  novel cannabinoid glycosides or “cannabosides” which are
