fitchs stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the presale report titled john deere owner trust b dated july   which is available on fitchs web site the presale report details how fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below key rating drivers high concentration of ag equipment jdot b is comprised of approximately  ag equipment consistent with the prior transactions dating back to  while ag equipment historical losses have been low the high concentration in the pool limits diversification however geographic diversity diversification within the ag sector and equipment versatility help mitigate the high concentration consistent collateral concentrations the pool contains  ag and  co equipment these concentrations are consistent with those of jdot  furthermore the pool consists of  annualpay contracts which historically have experienced a lower level of losses versus other payment types sufficient credit enhancement initial hard credit enhancement ce for jdot b is  consistent with  in jdot  the initial reserve in jdot b is  while the subordinated certificates provide  enhancement initial excess spread in jdot b is expected to be approximately  up from  in jdot  under fitchs aaasf scenario ce for the class a notes was able to withstand more than x the expected net loss rate of  stable origination underwriting and servicing jdcc has demonstrated strong capabilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its managed portfolio all securitizations issued and rated by fitch have performed within initial base case expectations integrity of legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses showing limited impact on the rating of the notes under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage additionally fitch was provided with thirdparty due
