lotthe lots are being marketed by long beach township mayor joseph h mancini  connecttweet  linkedin  commentemailmorelong beach township – for the last two years mayor joseph h mancini has paid an average of  a year in property taxes on tracts of land his namesake companies bought for  millionnow the real estate company he heads as president mancini realty is marketing two vacant lots and three large elaborate homes some with elevators and rooftop decks the tax bills are estimated by the realty company to be  a year on each property on west judith avenue — for the new owners long beach island is widely considered a gem of east coast real estate where homes are in high demandnew homes in demand on long beach islandhad mancini paid taxes on the value assessed at the purchase price of  million for all  lots he and his development company mancini custom homes owns the bill would have come to about  per year but the lots were deemed unbuildable so mancini saw bargain basement property taxes due to assessments of between  and  per lot — even after one fivebedroom squarefoot house was built this year on  west judith ave thats a property tax of  per lot or about the price of a big mac fries and a sodathe average property tax for a homeowner in the township last year was experts say the low assessments on mancinis lots are within the boundaries of new jerseys complex land tax regulations which inevitably cost towns precious tax dollarsit is a typical move of somebody whos a real estate investor said marc pfeiffer assistant director and research fellow at the bloustein local government research center at rutgers university thats what real estate investors do they look for those plays and they take a riskin an email mancini  said he was not interested in being interviewed for this story good luck he addedbuy photo photo press file photo mancini is listed as president of mancini realty and mancini custom homes tom coleman long beach townships attorney said mancini doesnt have an ownership interest in the real estate company but does in the custom home company mancini runs the daytoday operations of the companies coleman said coleman though said he is not mancinis personal attorneybut mancini also lists himself in a june  township financial disclosure form as the full owner of five west judith properties including the one built at  west judith that was on the market for  millionhe has been mayor since  his father james j mancini held the same position from  until his death in mancini or mancini custom homes are listed in property records as owners of  lots on west judith purchases made over the last decadethe tax assessor tracy hafner has said that the low assessments were or are due to the lots being deemed by the towns zoning to be unbuildable at  by feet eachalthough the new jersey tax assessors handbook says that property must be assessed on the basis of price new jerseys constitutional provisions require uniformity of property taxation pfeiffer said so changing a propertys assessment based on an individual sale could create inequities with adjoining parcels that may be similar but didnt sell he saidlots on west judith have changed hands several times the last decade records show that mancini realty first purchased five noncontiguous lots on judith in  in december  the company sold the lots to mancini custom homes for  million according to public recordsmancini realty purchased another three lots in  for  according to records but in may  mancini custom homes purchased another four lots for  joining the noncontiguous lots into one long swath according to records that made each single unbuildable  by foot lot buildable as a single giant lot since each adjoining lot now touched the other and was owned by one companyread new homes in demand on lbimancini or his companies are listed on long beachs tax accounting website as the owner of another two lots on judith for a total of  but sale prices and dates were not availablecoleman said the lots were consolidated by deed when they were purchasedby new jersey statute he said the assessor hafner had one year to do an added assessment on the properties adding the assessment in october as hafner did absolutely does fall within that timeframe he saidhafner has said that she got behind on updating assessments on judith but that bills for added assessments just went out she said in an email on oct  that  properties on judith were given added assessmentsim by myself she said last week were shorthandedcoleman added that hafner has about two years worth of added assessments sitting in her office due to the damage by superstorm sandyits not like — and i say this respectfully — shes got nothing there to do coleman saida property sale does not trigger a reassessment either pfeiffer said changes in assessment are made when land is subdivided or when an improvement is made to the land — like a house being built even then the added value of the property is not immediate as mancinis case illustratesmancini obtained construction permits through his real estate company for two homes — at  and  west judith — in march the lots must have been combined in order to become buildable land use experts said and to accommodate the homes being developedwhen lots are combined to make them buildable for new homes the value of that land goes up said bernard haney the tax assessor in neptune tax assessors update their rolls every january though so there is often a lag reflecting that new value haney saidessentially we start working in the following year as soon as the new year hits thats statewide that is assessment law so thats not unique to any one municipality is there dollars that are lost by the fact that were in the following year absolutely haney said is there a better avenue to do it i will tell you i have been doing this for  years and i havent found one yetthe home at  west judith was built and on the market for  million for several weeks over the summer but still reflected an assessment of  when the press inquired with assessor hafner in september about the low assessments she said that her office was busy and shorthanded but that bills would get added assessments the home was removed from listings in october its tax bill was also adjusted from  a year in taxes to  but still showed an assessment in public records of the proposed home at  west judith is still on the market for  million and is expected to be ready for january according to mancinis website like its neighbor the homes tax bill was adjusted in october from  a year to  but still showed a land value of  according to property recordsmancini is not the only one getting assessments below  three other developers who own property on judith and neighboring streets have received assessments of between  and  per lot according to property recordsthat figure is well below the  average assessed value of a vacant lot on long beach island and vacant land is a rare and prized commodity on the milelong barrier empty lots can command soaring prices that reach  million according to records which do not delineate whether land is buildablehafner — who was reappointed last year by mancini and the towns two commissioners to a fouryear term and also serves as beach havens assessor — said in an email that property is assessed as is and where is regardless of ownership or other accusations you make she was paid  last year as long beach townships assessor according to public recordsthere are  parcels in both towns combined she continued and each parcel is valued based on state of nj driven tables that do not fluctuate by ownerthere were nearly  vacant properties throughout new jersey at the end of the summer of those a little more than  were assessed between  and  according to an asbury park press analysis of property records long beach township the largest municipality on long beach island had the most vacant properties on the island in  with  according to records of those  were assessed at  for a total tax value of with the exception of three properties in beach haven none of the five other towns that make up long beach island has properties assessed so low the next lowest amount for a vacant property on the island is  in surf city according to property recordseven if a lot is considered unbuildable and may need a number of costly permits an assessment of less than  per lot is considered by experts to be a bargain but not out of line it is also risky to purchase unbuildable lots because there is no guarantee they can be built on if they are combined or if various permits which can be costly will be issuedthere is no consensus among experts though whether a  assessment for property on land on the southern tip of long beach island within walking distance to the beach is the most accurate figureas gary s forshner a land use attorney in lawrenceville put it assessing land
