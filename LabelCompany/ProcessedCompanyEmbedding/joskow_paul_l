book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide title iv of the clean air act amendments of  created a market for electric utility emissions of sulfur dioxide so recent papers have argued that flaws in the design of the auctions that are part of this market have adversely affected its performance these papers incorrectly assume that trade can only occur at auctions however our empirical analysis of the so emissions market shows that the auctions have become a small part of a relatively efficient market and that the auction design problems that have attracted the most attention have had no effect on actual market prices a quantitative analysis of pricing behavior in californias wholesale electricity market during summer  by paul l joskow book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide during the summer of  wholesale electricity prices in california were nearly  higher than they were during the same months in  or  this price explosion was unexpected and has called into question whether electricity restructuring will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers this paper examines the factors that explain this increase in wholesale electricity prices competitive benchmark prices for summer of  are simulated taking account of all relevant supply and demand factors  gas prices demand imports from other states and emission permit prices the simulated competitive benchmark prices are then compared with the actual prices observed a large gap between is found between the benchmark competitive prices and observed prices suggesting that the prices observed during summer  reflect in part the exercise of market power by suppliers supplier behavior during highprice hours is then examined suppliers withheld supply from the market that would have been profitable for pricetaking firms to sell at the market price political constraints on executive compensation  evidence from the electric utility industry by paul l joskow book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this study explores the effect of regulatory and political constraints on the level of ceo compensation for  stateregulated electric utilities during  the results suggest that political pressures may constrain top executive pay levels in this industry first ceos of firms operating in regulatory environments characterized by investment banks as relatively proconsumer receive lower compensation than do ceos of firms in environments ranked as more friendly to investors second ceo pay is lower for utilities with relatively high or rising rates or a higher proportion of industrial sales consistent with earlier research that describes political pressures on electricity rates finally attributes of the commission appointment and tenure rules affect ceo compensation in ways consistent with the political constraint hypothesis for example pay is lower in states with elected commissioners than in states where commissioners are appointed by the governor all else equal despite apparently effective pressure to constrain pay levels in this sector however we find no evidence of related intraindustry variation in the sensitivity of pay to firm financial performance ceo pay and firm performance  dynamics asymmetries and alternative performance measures by paul l joskow book  editions published between  and  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this study explores the dynamic structure of the payfor performance relationship in ceo compensation and quantifies the effect of introducing a more complex model of firm financial performance on the estimated performance sensitivity of executive pay the results suggest that current compensation responds to past performance outcomes but that the effect decays considerably within two years this contrasts sharply with models of infinitely persistent performance effects implicitly assumed in much of the empirical compensation literature we find that both accounting and market performance measures influence compensation and that the salary and bonus component of pay as well as total compensation have become more sensitive to firm financial performance over the past two decades there is no evidence that boards fail to penalize ceos for poor financial performance or reward them disproportionately well for good performance finally the data suggest that boards may discount extreme performance outcomes both high and low  relative to performance that lies within some ormal band in setting compensation reliability and competitive electricity markets by paul l joskow book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide despite all of the talk about deregulation of the electricity sector a large number of nonmarket mechanisms have been imposed on emerging competitive wholesale and retail markets these mechanisms include spot market price caps operating reserve requirements nonprice rationing protocols and administrative protocols for managing system emergencies many of these mechanisms have been carried over from the old regime of regulated monopoly and continue to be justified as necessary responses to market imperfections of various kinds and engineering requirements dictated by the special physical attributes of electric power networks this paper seeks to bridge the gap between economists focused on designing competitive market mechanisms and engineers focused on the physical attributes and engineering requirements they perceive as being needed for operating a reliable electric power system the paper starts by deriving the optimal prices and investment program when there are priceinsensitive retail consumers and their load serving entities can choose any level of rationing they prefer contingent on real time prices it then examines the assumptions required for a competitive wholesale and retail market to achieve this optimal price and investment program the paper analyses the implications of relaxing several of these assumptions first it analyzes the interrelationships between regulatorimposed price caps capacity obligations and system operator procurement dispatch and compensation arrangements it goes on to explore the implications of potential network collapses the concomitant need for operating reserve requirements and whether market prices will provide incentives for investments consistent with these reserve requirements jel classifications l l l californias electricity crisis by paul l joskow book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the collapse of california₂s electricity restructuring and competition program has attracted attention around the world prices in california₂s competitive wholesale electricity market increased by  between the second half of  and the second half of  for the first four months of  wholesale spot prices averaged over mwh ten times what they were is  and  some customers have been required involuntarily to curtail electricity consumption in response to supply shortages while wholesale prices rose dramatically retail prices were fixed until early in   as a result california₂s two largest utilities  pacific gas  electric pg  e and southern california edison sce  were paying far more for wholesale power than they were able to resell it for at retail both effectively became insolvent in january  and stopped paying their bills for power and certain other financial obligations pg  e declared bankruptcy on april   and its reorganization is now before a federal bankruptcy court merchant transmission investment by paul l joskow book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide we examine the performance attributes of a merchant transmission investment framework that relies on ₃market driven₄ transmission investment to provide the infrastructure to support competitive wholesale markets for electricity under a stringent set of assumptions the merchant investment model has a remarkable set of attributes that appear to solve the natural monopoly problem and the associated need for regulating transmission companies traditionally associated with electric transmission networks we expand the merchant model upon which these conclusions are based to incorporate imperfections in wholesale electricity markets lumpiness in transmission investment opportunities stochastic attributes of transmission networks and associated property rights definition issues the effects of the behavior of system operators and transmission owners on transmission capacity and reliability coordination and bargaining considerations forward contract commitment and asset specificity issues incorporating these more realistic attributes of transmission networks and the behavior of transmission owners and system operators significantly undermines the attractive properties of the merchant investment model relying primarily on a market driven investment framework to govern investment in electric transmission networks is likely to lead to inefficient investment decisions and undermine the performance of competitive markets for electricity a significant research challenge is to design regulatory mechanisms for system operators and incumbent transmission owners and a better framework for defining transmission property rights that will stimulate efficient investments by regulated incumbent transmission owners and by merchant entrants responding to market opportunities when they are the most efficient suppliers us energy policy during the s by paul l joskow book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this essay discusses us energy policy and the associated evolution of energy supply energy demand energy prices and the industrial organization of the domestic energy industries during the period  through  this period covers the last two years of the george hw bush administration and the entire clinton administration it begins with an energy crisis stimulated by the invasion of kuwait and the subsequent gulf war and ends with an energy crisis caused by significant increases in oil and especially natural gas prices the collapse of californias new competitive electricity markets and the threat of electricity shortages throughout the western us both energy crises led the sitting presidents administrations to develop national energy strategies and to try to convince congress to enact comprehensive energy legislation to implement them neither energy crisis had the severe economic impact or led to the kinds of dramatic and often illconceived policy responses observed following the two oil shocks of the s the  energy crisis was shortlived and interest in energy policy soon faded it would not be surprising if the latest energy crisis follows a similar course retail electricity competition by paul l joskow book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide we analyze a number of unstudied aspects of retail electricity competition we first explore the implications of load profiling of consumers whose traditional meters do not permit the measurement of their realtime consumption the combination of retail competition and load profiling does not yield the secondbest prices given the nonpriceresponsiveness of retail consumers we then examine the incentives that electricity retailers have to install each of two types of advanced metering equipment finally we consider the implications of physical limitations on the ability of system operators to cut off individual consumers relying instead of zonal rationing of large groups of individual consumers the diffusion of new technologies  evidence from the electric utility industry by nancy l rose book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper investigates the effect of firm size and ownership structure on technology adoption decisions using data on the electric utility industry we argue that traditional models of technology diffusion are subject to sample selectivity biases that may overstate the effect of firm size on adoption probabilities by extending conventional hazard rate models to use information on both adoption and nonadoption decisions we differentiate between firms opportunities for adoption and their underlying adoption propensities the results suggest that large firms and investorowned electric utilities are likely to adopt new technologies earlier than their smaller and publiclyowned counterparts moreover the selection biases from conventional statistical models can lead one to overstate size effects by a factor of two and to understate ownership structure and factor cost effects by two to four times diffusion of new technologies in the electric utilities industry   editions published in  in english

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
