product development clients often need help taking a good product and turning it into something great that is where design and creativity can make all the difference a tshirt has little perceived value but if it has a swanky design on it that appeals to a specific target audience it evolves from being a piece of clothing into a coveted and collectible lifestyle accessory here are several examples of how we turned ordinary items—everything from apparel to stationery to home decor and school supplies—into successful lines of products apparel design farm boyfarm girl creating designs for such a hip client as farm boy was a real honor they already have a full line of very cool products so we were a bit intimidated by the high bar their collection has already set nevertheless we rolled up our sleeves and put in several honest days’ work designer ligia teodosiu apparel design farm boyfarm girl hats and tshirts are essential for farm fashion designer ligia teodosiu creative director joel anderson apparel design farm boyfarm girl ah tractors and tail feathers these tshirt themes practically design themselves designer ligia teodosiu apparel design farm boyfarm girl a good tshirt design can work on lots of colors you can’t go wrong with pink for chix designer andy gregg creative director joel anderson apparel design farm boyfarm girl and you can’t go wrong with blue for dudes designer andy gregg creative director joel anderson apparel design farm boyfarm girl these two designs were aimed at guys so we had andy plow deep into his fertile imagination to create the art designer andy gregg apparel design farm boyfarm girl we borrowed some inspiration from a famous wwii propaganda poster for one of these designs designer ligia teodosiu apparel design farm boyfarm girl industrial colors seem to work well for this sort of fashion design designers ligia teodosiu  andy gregg creative director joel anderson wall decor harleydavidson one of our favorite licensing partners meissenburg designs takes our art and creates awesome wood and metal signs they recently became a harleydavidson decor products licensee they asked us to help them create a series of new harleyapproved designs designer  ilustrator joel anderson wall decor harleydavidson continued we were designing under a time crunch so this first batch of designs was created from skulls we nabbed from royaltyfree stock art sites then we revved up our creative engines and made a series of badtothebone art that meissenburg turned into wood and metal signs to sell in harley dealerships across the country designer joel anderson box postcard set  art  soul of america we took  of our most popular american travel posters and shrunk them down to postcard size creating a lovely collectible postcard set we created  specially designed boxes to divide up each group of cards—one for western cities one for national parks and one for eastern cities if you line up the backs of the  boxes you get a swanky allamerican scene designer joel anderson stationerypostcards cicada invasion every good product line starts with an underexploited natural resource take cicadas for instance in nashville they come out once every  years and drive everyone crazy one of nature’s little jokes provided an excellent opportunity for us to develop an entire line of postcards posters and gifts designer joel anderson novelty gifts cicada invasion we dreamed up this whole collection  years ago the last time the periodical cicadas invaded nashville so when they came back we were ready for them with swatters beer mugs tshirts stickers posters and more gifts  apparel cicada invasion when we develop a line of products we ask “who is the target audience and what will motivate them to buy the items we are creating” in this case it’s anyone who loves or hates cicadas postershome decor cicada invasion a good product is something people need or really want if it is super stylish then it becomes a statement about the user that is where design plays a big role—taking an ordinary item and making it a coversation piece in this case art for a poster would also become a set of commemorative postcards and tshirt designs illustrator andy gregg collectible gifts spirit of nashville it all started with our line of classic posters created to celebrate nashville’s history and charm once the poster art was done the next logical step was to put the art on highend gifts and collectibles foodlicensing spirit of nashville licensing is a great way to deepen a product line once a brand is established it’s easy to partner up with makers of other products that appeal to the same target audience in this case we’ve lent our music city designs to a southern shortbread maker willa’s shortbread it’s a match made in heaven—he sells more cookies and we extend our product line into new categories fashion accessories spirit of nashville a tote bag is a logical extension to a line that already has everything we created a pattern that featured the most popular spirit of nashville designs and icons and we embellished a canvas tote chicks dig it designer joel anderson wall calendar art  soul of america we created a  promotional calendar with the french paper company to show off their paper and our new line of classic american travel poster art the calendar won a gold addy a gold regional addy and in may  it went on to the national addys it was also selected to appear in print magazine’s  regional design annual designers joel anderson andy gregg ligia teodosiu  edward patton
