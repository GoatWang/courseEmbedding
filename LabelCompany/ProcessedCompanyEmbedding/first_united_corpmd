a bank holding company that through the bank and its nonbank subsidiaries provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and two northeastern west virginia counties its principal operating subsidiary is the bank which consists of a community banking network of  branch offices located throughout its market areas our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers consolidated net income available to common shareholders was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for  basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended december   was  compared to basic and diluted net income per common share of  for  the decrease in earnings for  was due to a decrease of  million in interest income primarily interest on loans and an increase in provision expense of  million offset by an increase of  million in other operating income a decrease of  million in interest expense and a  million decrease in other operating expenses the increase in other operating income was attributable to an increase of  million in gains on sales of securities a  million increase in trust department income and a  million increase in bank owned life insurance boli income these increases were offset by a  million decrease in service charges primarily nsf fees and a  million decrease in other income the decrease in other operating expenses was due to a decrease of  million in salaries and benefits a decrease of  million in other real estate owned oreo expenses and a decrease of  million in other miscellaneous expenses the increase of  million on the series a preferred stock dividends in  also contributed to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders due to an increase in the contractual rate paid in  the net interest margin for the year ended december   on a fully tax equivalent fte basis decreased to  from  for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses increased to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   the increase was driven by rolling historical loss rates managements consideration of the qualitative factors that are likely to cause losses and an  million recovery on a large commercial real estate credit during the third quarter of  specific allocations have been made for impaired loans where management has determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance and the qualitative factors affecting the allowance for loan losses the all have been adjusted based on the current economic environment and the characteristics of the loan portfolio interest expense on our interestbearing liabilities decreased  million for the year ended december   when compared to  due to a decrease of  million in average interestbearing deposits and a decrease of  basis points on the average rate paid on longterm borrowings during  we continued to focus on shifting our deposit mix away from higher cost certificates of deposit and toward lower cost money market and transaction accounts other operating income increased  million for the year ended december   when compared to  this increase was primarily attributable to  million in gains on the sale of securities for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   a  million increase in trust department income and a  million increase in boli income the increase in boli income was attributable to a onetime death benefit of  million received in december  operating expenses decreased  million for the year ended december   when compared to the same period of  this decrease was due to decreases of  million in salaries and benefits  million in oreo expenses and  million in other expenses declines in other expenses were due primarily to reduced personnel related expenses such as in house training a decline in telephone expenses and reduced fraud expenses related to debit cards comparing december   to december   outstanding loans increased  million  cre loans decreased  million as a result of the payoff of two large loans of approximately  million during the third quarter of  acquisition and development ad loans decreased  million due to regularly scheduled principal payments and payoffs commercial and industrial ci loans increased  million due to new loan relationships primarily one large relationship in the first quarter of  residential mortgage loans increased  million due to increased production of loans primarily in our  and  adjustable rate mortgage program the bank continues to use fannie mae for the majority of new longerterm fixedrate residential loan originations the consumer loan portfolio decreased slightly by  million due to repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio offsetting new production at december   approximately  of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate compared to approximately  at december    interest income on loans decreased by  million on a fte basis in  when compared to  due to the continued low rate environment interest income on our investment securities increased by  million on a fte basis in  when compared to  due to purchases during  additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table  that appears on page  total deposits at december   increased  million when compared to december   we recorded increases in core deposits and reductions in certificates of deposit due to our continued focus on shifting the mix of our deposit portfolio from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost money market and transaction accounts noninterest bearing deposits increased  million traditional savings accounts increased  million due to continued growth in our prime saver product total demand deposits decreased  million and total money market accounts increased  million time deposits less than  declined  million and time deposits greater than  decreased  million interest expense

incomeother operating expense other operating income exclusive of gains decreased  million for the year ended december   when compared to  service charge income decreased  million for the year ended december   when compared to  due to reduced insufficient funds fees nsf fees the reduction in nsf fees was due to the increased regulations on fees other income declined by  million due to a decline

other income for the year ended december   compared to net gains of  million for  the increase in net gains for  over  was due to a net gain of  million realized on sales of investment securities

expenses and  million in other expenses declines in other expenses were due primarily to reduced personnel related expenses such as in house training a decline in telephone expenses and reduced fraud expenses related to debit cards dividends  the corporations board of directors suspended the payment of dividends on outstanding shares of common stock in december  when it approved the deferral cash of dividends on the series a preferred stock and this suspension remains in effect looking forward  we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future including without limitation changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets fluctuations in interest rates and changes to existing federal and state laws and regulations that apply to banks and financial holding companies for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors see item a of part i of this annual report estimates and critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities see note  to the consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates estimates and bases those estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses or all one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio including the calculation of the all the valuation of underlying collateral the timing of loan chargeoffs and the placement of loans on nonaccrual status the all is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio current and historical trends in delinquencies and chargeoffs and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction changes in lending rates political conditions legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia because the calculation of the all relies on managements estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events actual results may differ from managements estimates  the all is also discussed below in item  under the heading allowance for loan losses and in note  to the consolidated financial statements goodwill asc topic  intangibles  goodwill and other establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill at december   we had  million in recorded goodwill that is related to the  acquisition of huntington national bank and is not subject to periodic amortization goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the corporations reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets including goodwill if the estimated current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded otherwise additional testing is performed and to the extent such additional testing results in a conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized our goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking business and that value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality cost effective services in a highly competitive local market this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems the development of valueadded service features and the ease of use of our services as such goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill which could adversely impact earnings in future periods asc topic  requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and estimates during  shares of the corporations common stock traded at prices that were below the common stocks book value and at december   the sales price was below the common stocks tangible book value management believed that these circumstances could indicate the possibility of impairment accordingly management consulted a third party valuation specialist to assist it with the determination of the fair value of the corporation considering both the market approach guideline public company method and the income approach discounted future benefits method due to the illiquidity in the common stock and the adverse conditions surrounding the banking industry reliance was placed on the income approach in determining the fair value of the corporation the income approach is a discounted cash flow analysis that is determined by adding i the present value which is a representation of the current value of a sum that is to be received some time in the future of the estimated net income net of dividends paid out that the corporation could generate over the next five years and ii the present value of a terminal value which is a representation of the current value of an entity at a specified time in the future the terminal value was calculated using both a price to tangible book multiple method and a capitalization method and the more conservative of the two was utilized in the fair value calculation significant assumptions used in the above methods include · net income from our forward fiveyear operating budget incorporating conservative growth and mix assumptions · a discount rate of  based on an internally derived cost of equity capital determined using the buildup method · a price to tangible book multiple of x which was the median multiple of nonassisted transactions for nonassisted commercial bank acquisitions during the twelve months ended september   for selling companies headquartered in the eastern regional area as compiled by boenning  scattergood inc and · a capitalization rate of  discount rate of  adjusted for a conservative growth rate of  the resulting fair value of the income approach resulted in the fair value of the corporation exceeding the carrying value by  management stressed the assumptions used in the analysis to provide additional support for the derived value this stress testing showed that i the discount rate could increase to  before the excess would be eliminated in the tangible multiple method and accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes under this guidance deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date  we regularly review the carrying amount of our net deferred tax assets to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods then a deferred tax valuation allowance must be established consideration is given to various positive and negative factors that could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets in evaluating this available evidence management considers among other things historical performance expectations of future earnings the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid length of statutory carry forward periods experience with utilization of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring tax planning strategies and timing of reversals of temporary differences significant judgment is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences our evaluation is based on current tax laws as well as managements expectations of future performance management expects that the corporations adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of changes in judgment or measurement including changes in actual and forecasted income before taxes tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities management systematically evaluates the securities in our investment portfolio for impairment on a quarterly basis based upon the application of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in asc topic  section  management assesses whether i we have the intent to sell a security being evaluated and ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery if neither applies then declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are considered otherthantemporary declines are split into two components the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made the second component consists of all other losses which are recognized in other comprehensive loss in estimating otherthantemporary impairment otti losses management considers a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost b adverse conditions specifically related to the security an industry or a geographic area c the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security d changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency e recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date f failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments and g the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future management also monitors cash flow projections for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of asc subtopic  investments  other  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets asc section  this process is described more fully in the section of the consolidated balance sheet review entitled investment securities fair value of investments we have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements we measure the fair market values of our investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in topic  the determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in note  to the consolidated financial statements pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts as discussed within the requirements of asc topic  compensation  retirement benefits pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics such as retirement patterns employee turnover mortality rates and estimated employer compensation increases these factors along with the critical assumptions are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries further information about our pension plan assumptions the plans funded status and other plan information is included in note  to the consolidated financial statements other than as discussed above management does not believe that any material changes in our critical accounting policies have occurred since december    adoption of new accounting standards and effects of new accounting pronouncements note  to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting consolidated statement of income review net interest

in interest income was primarily due to the  million  reduction in the average balance of loans and a decrease of  basis points on yields when comparing the years ended december   and december   the reduction in loan yields was attributable to loans repricing at lower rates and new loans booked at lower rates the decline in interest income was partially offset by a decline in interest expense due

management’s evaluation of potential impairment is based on management’s a ssessment of the ultimate recoverability of the cost of the restricted stock rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability is influenced by criteria such as a the significance of the decline in net assets of the issuing bank as compared to the capital stock amount for that bank and the length of time this situation has persisted b commitments by the issuing bank to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of that bank and c the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and accordingly on the customer base of the issuing bank

segments of the bank’s loan portfolio are disaggregated to a level that allows management to monitor risk and performance the commercial real estate “cre” loan segment is then segregated into two classes nonowner occupied cre loans which include loans secured by nonowner occupied nonfarm and nonresidential properties generally have a greater risk profile than all other cre loans which include loans secured by farmland multifamily structures and owneroccupied commercial structures the acquisition and development “ad” loan segment is segregated into two classes onetofour family residential construction loans are generally made to individuals for the acquisition of andor construction on a lot or lots on which a residential dwelling is to be built all other ad loans are generally made to developers or investors for the purpose of acquiring developing and constructing residential or commercial structures ad loans have a higher risk profile because the ultimate buyer once development is completed is generally not known at the time of the loan is made the commercial and industrial “ci” loan segment consists of loans made for the purpose of financing the activities of commercial customers the residential mortgage loan segment is segregated into two classes amortizing term loans are primarily first lien loans home equity lines of credit are generally second lien loans the consumer loan segment consists primarily of installment loans direct and indirect and overdraft lines of credit connected with customer deposit accounts   management uses a point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio the first six categories are considered not criticized and are aggregated as “pass” rated the criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions the special mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a substandard classification loans in the substandard category have welldefined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected all loans greater than  days past due are considered substandard the portion of a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses that management believes is associated with a pending event that could trigger loss in the shortterm will be classified in the doubtful category any portion of a loan that has been charged off is placed in the loss category        to help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed the bank has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight generally consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass categories unless a specific action such as bankruptcy repossession or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event the bank’s commercial loan officers are responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in the commercial segments at origination and on an ongoing basis the bank’s experienced credit quality and loan review department performs an annual review of all commercial relationships of  or greater confirmation of the appropriate risk grade is included as part of the review process on an ongoing basis the credit quality and loan review department continually reviews and assesses loans within the portfolio in addition the bank engages an external consultant to conduct loan reviews on at least an annual basis generally the external consultant reviews commercial relationships greater than  andor criticized relationships greater than  detailed reviews including plans for resolution are performed on loans classified as substandard on a quarterly basis loans in the special mention

than  and is either i in nonaccrual status or ii riskrated substandard and greater than  days past due loans are considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement factors considered by management in evaluating impairment include payment status collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay the reasons for the delay the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed the bank does not separately evaluate individual consumer and residential mortgage loans for impairment unless such loans are part of a larger relationship that is impaired otherwise loans in these segments are considered impaired when they are classified as nonaccrual   once the determination has been made that a loan is impaired the determination of whether a specific allocation of the allowance is necessary is measured by comparing the recorded investment in the loan to the fair value of the loan using one of three methods a the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate b the loan’s observable market price or c the fair value of the collateral less selling costs the method is selected on a loanbyloan basis with management primarily utilizing the fair value of collateral method if the fair value of the collateral less selling costs method is utilized for collateral securing loans in the commercial segments then an updated external appraisal is ordered on the collateral supporting the loan if the loan balance is greater than  and the existing appraisal is greater than  months old if an appraisal is less than  months old the age at which the internal appraisal grid begins and if management believes that general market conditions in that geographic market have changed considerably the property has deteriorated or perhaps lost an income stream or a recent appraisal for a similar property indicates a significant change then management may adjust the fair value indicated by the existing appraisal until a new appraisal is obtained if the most recent appraisal is greater than  months old or if an updated appraisal has not been received and reviewed in time for the determination of estimated fair value at quarter or year end then the estimated fair value of the collateral is determined by adjusting the existing appraisal by the appropriate percentage from an internally prepared appraisal discount grid this grid considers the age of a third party appraisal and the geographic region where the collateral is located in order to discount an appraisal that is greater than  months old the discount rates in the appraisal discount grid are updated quarterly to reflect the most current knowledge that management has available including the results of current appraisals if there is a delay in receiving an updated appraisal or if the appraisal is found to be deficient in our internal appraisal review process and reordered then the bank continues to use a discount factor from the appraisal discount grid based on the collateral location and current appraisal age in order to determine the estimated fair value a specific allocation of the all is recorded if there is any deficiency in collateral value determined by comparing the estimated fair value to the recorded investment of the loan when updated appraisals are received and reviewed adjustments are made to the specific allocation as needed        the evaluation of the need and amount of a specific allocation of the all and whether a loan can be removed from impairment status is made on a quarterly basis   the following table presents impaired loans by class segregated by those for which a specific

                              loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are analyzed with general allowances being made as appropriate for general allowances historical loss trends are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio these historical loss amounts are modified by other qualitative factors        the classes described above which are based on the federal call code assigned to each loan provide the starting point for the all analysis management tracks the historical net chargeoff activity full and partial chargeoffs net of full and partial recoveries at the call code level a historical chargeoff factor is calculated utilizing a defined number of consecutive historical quarters consumer pools currently utilize a rolling  quarters while commercial pools currently utilize a rolling eight quarters   “pass” rated credits are segregated from “criticized” credits for the application of qualitative factors the uncriticized “pass” pools for commercial and residential real estate are further segmented based upon the geographic location of the underlying collateral there are seven geographic regions utilized – six that represent the bank’s lending footprint and a seventh for all outofmarket credits different economic environments and resultant credit risks exist in each region that are acknowledged in the assignment of qualitative factors loans in the criticized pools which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues are closely monitored by management and subject to additional qualitative factors   management supplements the historical chargeoff factor with a number of additional qualitative factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing loan pools to differ from historical loss experience the additional factors which are evaluated quarterly and updated using information obtained from internal regulatory and governmental sources are a national and local economic trends and conditions b levels of and trends in delinquency rates and nonaccrual loans c trends in volumes and terms of loans d effects of changes in lending policies e experience ability and depth of lending staff f value of underlying collateral and g concentrations of credit from a loan type industry andor geographic standpoint   management reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the all when information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible these amounts are promptly charged off against the all residential mortgage and consumer loans are charged off after they are  days contractually past due all other loans are charged off based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual loan when the bank believes that its ability to collect is solely dependent on the liquidation of the collateral a full or partial chargeoff is recorded promptly to bring the recorded investment to an amount that the bank believes is supported by an ability to collect on the collateral the circumstances that may impact the bank’s decision to chargeoff all or a portion of a loan include default or nonpayment by the borrower scheduled foreclosure actions andor prioritization of the bank’s claim in bankruptcy there may be circumstances where due to pending events the bank will place a specific allocation of the all on a loan for which a partial chargeoff has been previously recognized this specific allocation may be either charged off or removed depending upon the outcome of the pending event full or partial chargeoffs are not recovered until full principal and interest on the loan have been collected even if a subsequent appraisal supports a higher value loans with partial chargeoffs remain in nonaccrual status both full and partial chargeoffs reduce the recorded investment of the loan and the all and are considered to be chargeoffs for purposes of all credit loss metrics and trends including the historical rolling chargeoff rates used in the determination of the all   activity in the all is presented

reasons these reasons may include as a retention strategy remaining competitive in the current interest rate environment and reamortizing or extending a loan term to better match the loan’s payment stream with the borrower’s cash flows a modified loan is considered to be a troubled debt restructuring “tdr” when the bank has determined that the borrower is troubled ie experiencing financial difficulties the bank evaluates the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt obligations in the foreseeable future without modification to make this determination the bank performs a global financial review of the borrower and loan guarantors to assess their current ability to meet their financial obligations   when the bank restructures a loan to a troubled borrower the loan terms ie interest rate payment amount amortization period andor maturity date are modified in such a way as to enable the borrower to cover the modified debt service payments based on current financials and cash flow adequacy if a borrower’s hardship is thought to be temporary then modified terms are only offered for that time period where possible the bank obtains additional collateral andor secondary payment sources at the time of the restructure in order to put the bank in the best possible position if the borrower is not able to meet the modified terms to date the bank has not forgiven any principal as a restructuring concession the bank will not offer modified terms if it believes that modifying the loan terms will only delay an inevitable permanent default   all loans designated as tdrs are considered impaired loans and may be in either accruing or nonaccruing status the corporation’s policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans does not differ from its overall policy for interest recognition accordingly the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest is delinquent for  days or more unless the loan is wellsecured and in the process of collection if the loan was accruing at the time of the modification then it continues to be in accruing status subsequent to the modification nonaccrual tdrs may return to accruing status when there has been sufficient payment performance for a period of at least six months loans may be removed from tdr status in the calendar year following the modification if the interest rate at the time of modification was consistent with the interest rate for a loan with comparable credit risk and the loan has performed according to its modified terms for at least six months   the volume and type of tdr activity is considered in the assessment of the local economic trends’ qualitative factor used in the determination of the all for loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment

financial instruments   the corporation complies with the guidance of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements  the corporation also follows the guidance on matters relating to all financial instruments found in asc subtopic  financial instruments – overall         fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants as of the measurement date fair value is best determined by values quoted through active trading markets active trading markets are characterized by numerous transactions of similar financial instruments between willing buyers and willing sellers because no active trading market exists for various types of financial instruments many of the fair values disclosed were derived using present value discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques described below as a result the corporation’s ability to actually realize these derived values cannot be assumed   t he corporation measures fair values based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc paragraph  the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value under the hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities this level is the most reliable source of valuation   level  quoted prices that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level  inputs include inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example interest rates and yield curves at commonly quoted intervals volatilities prepayment speeds loss severities credit risks and default rates it also includes inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means marketcorroborated inputs several sources are utilized for valuing these assets including a contracted valuation service standard  poor’s “sp” evaluations and pricing services and other valuation matrices   level  prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and not readily observable in the market ie supported with little or no market activity level  instruments are valued based on the best available data some of which is internally developed and consider risk premiums that a market participant would require   the level established within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement   the corporation believes that its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with the techniques used by other market participants however the use of different methodologies and assumptions could result in a different estimate of fair values at the reporting date t he valuation techniques used by the corporation to measure on a recurring and nonrecurring basis the fair value of assets as of june   are discussed in the paragraphs that follow   investments – the investment portfolio is classified and accounted for based on the guidance of asc topic  investments – debt and equity securities    the fair value of investments availableforsale is determined using a market approach as of june   the us government agencies residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities and municipal bonds segments are classified as level  within the valuation hierarchy their fair values were determined based upon marketcorroborated inputs and valuation matrices which were obtained through third party data service providers or securities brokers through which the corporation has historically transacted both purchases and sales of investment securities   the cdo segment which consists of pooled trust preferred securities issued by banks thrifts and insurance companies is classified as level  within the valuation hierarchy at june   the corporation owned  pooled trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of   million and a fair value of   million the market for these securities at june   is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bidask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels the new issue market is also inactive as few cdos have been issued since  there are currently very few market participants who are willing to effect transactions in these securities the market values for these securities or any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the us department of the treasury the “treasury” are depressed relative to historical levels therefore in the current market a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general rather than being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue given the conditions in the current debt markets and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets management has determined that a the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of obtaining fair value at june   b an income valuation approach technique ie present value that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than a market approach and c the cdo segment is appropriately classified within level  of the valuation hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date        management utilizes an independent third party to prepare both the evaluations of otti as well as the fair value determinations for its cdo portfolio management does not believe that there were any material differences in the otti evaluations and pricing between june   and december     the approach used by the third party to determine fair value involves several steps including detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in each bond default recovery and prepaymentamortization probabilities for each piece of collateral in the bond and discounted cash flow modeling the discount rate methodology used by the third party combines a baseline current market yield for comparable corporate and structured credit products with adjustments based on evaluations of the differences found in structure and risks associated with actual and projected credit performance of each cdo being valued currently the only active and liquid trading market that exists is for standalone trust preferred securities therefore adjustments to the baseline discount rate are also made to reflect the additional leverage found in structured instruments   derivative financial instruments cash flow hedge – the corporation’s open derivative positions are interest rate swaps that are classified as level  within the valuation hierarchy open derivative positions are valued using externally developed pricing models based on observable market inputs provided by a third party and validated by management the corporation has considered counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap assets   impaired loans – loans included in the table below are those that are considered impaired with a specific allocation or with a partial chargeoff based upon the guidance of the loan impairment subsection of the receivables topic asc section  under which the corporation has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral fair value consists of the loan balance less its valuation allowance and is generally determined based on independent thirdparty appraisals of the collateral or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements   other real estate owned – other real estate owned included in the table below are considered impaired with specific writedowns fair value of other real estate owned is based on independent thirdparty appraisals of the properties these values were determined based on the sales prices of similar properties in the approximate geographic area these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level

the various valuation methodologies the derived fair values are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment therefore they cannot be determined with precision changes in the assumptions could significantly impact the derived estimates of fair value disclosure of nonfinancial assets such as buildings as well as certain financial instruments such as leases is not required accordingly the aggregate fair values presented do not represent the underlying value of the corporation   the following methods and assumptions were used by the corporation to estimate its fair value disclosures for financial instruments   cash and due from banks the carrying amounts as reported in the statement of financial condition for cash and due from banks approximate their fair values   interest bearing deposits in banks the carrying amount of interest bearing deposits approximates their fair values        securities held to maturity investments in debt securities classified as held to maturity are measured subsequently at amortized cost in the statement of financial position these assets are included as level  fair values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements   restricted investment in bank stock the carrying value of stock issued by the fhlb of atlanta acbb and cbb approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the stock   loans excluding impaired loans with specific loss allowances for variablerate loans that reprice frequently or “in one year or less” and with no significant change in credit risk fair values are based on carrying values fair values for fixedrate loans that do not reprice frequently are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market interest rates being offered on the various loan products   deposits the fair values disclosed for demand deposits eg interest and noninterest checking savings and certain types of money market accounts etc are by definition equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date ie their carrying amounts fair values for fixedrate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on the various certificates of deposit to the cash flow stream   borrowed funds the fair value of the bank’s fhlb borrowings and junior subordinated debt is calculated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows using rates currently existing for borrowings with similar remaining maturities the carrying amounts of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase approximate their fair values   accrued interest the carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates their fair values   offbalancesheet financial instruments in the normal course of business the bank makes commitments to extend credit and issues standby letters of credit the bank expects most of these commitments to expire without being drawn upon therefore the commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements due to the uncertainty of cash flows and difficulty in the predicting the timing of such cash flows fair values were not estimated for these instruments        the following tables present fair value information about financial instruments whether or not

other stockbased awards to employees or directors   on june   the board of directors of first united corporation adopted a longterm incentive program the “ltip” this program was adopted as a subplan of the omnibus plan to reward participants for increasing shareholder value align executive interests with those of shareholders and serve as a retention tool for key executives under the ltip participants are granted shares of restricted common stock of first united corporation the amount of an award is based on a specified percentage of the participant’s salary as of the date of grant these shares will vest if the corporation meets or exceeds certain performance thresholds there were no grants of restricted stock outstanding at june          the corporation complies with the provisions of asc topic  compensation  stock compensation  in measuring and disclosing stock compensation cost the measurement objective in asc paragraph  requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award the cost is recognized in expense over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the vesting period the performancerelated shares granted in connection with the ltip are expensed ratably from the date that the likelihood of meeting the performance measures is probable through the end of a three year vesting period   the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the “recovery act” imposes restrictions on the type and timing of bonuses and incentive compensation that may be accrued for or paid to certain employees of institutions like first united corporation that participated in treasury’s capital purchase program the recovery act generally limits bonuses and incentive compensation to grants of longterm restricted stock that among other requirements cannot fully vest until the capital purchase program

ended june   and  for the six months ended june   stock compensation expense was  and  for the three months ended june   and  respectively   note  – letters of credit and off balance sheet liabilities   the corporation does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure other than the standby letters of credit issued by the bank  standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party  generally the bank’s letters of credit are issued with expiration dates within one year  the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers  the bank generally holds collateral andor personal guarantees supporting these commitments  the bank had  million of outstanding standby letters of credit at june   and  million as of december   management believes that the proceeds obtained through a liquidation of collateral and the enforcement of guarantees would be sufficient to cover the potential amount of future payment required by the letters of credit  management does not believe that the amount of the liability associated with guarantees under standby letters of credit outstanding at june   and december   is material   note  – derivative financial instruments   as a part of managing interest rate risk the bank entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain interestbearing liabilities the corporation has designated these interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges under the guidance of asc subtopic  derivatives and hedging – cash flow hedges  cash flow hedges have the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative net of taxes recorded in net accumulated other comprehensive income   in july  the corporation entered into three interest rate swap contracts totaling  million notional amount hedging future cash flows associated with floating rate trust preferred debt as of june   swap contracts totaling  million notional amount remained as the threeyear  million contract matured on june   the fiveyear  million contract matures june   and the sevenyear  million contract matures june   the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was  thousand at june   and  thousand at december   and was reported in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition cash in the amount of  million was posted as collateral as of june     for the six months ended june   the corporation recorded an increase in the value of the derivatives of  thousand and the related deferred tax benefit of  thousand in net accumulated other comprehensive loss to reflect the effective portion of cash flow hedges asc subtopic  requires this amount to be reclassified to earnings if the hedge becomes ineffective or is terminated there was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded for the six months ending june   the corporation does not expect any losses relating to these hedges to be reclassified into earnings within the next  months   interest rate swap agreements are entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and the corporation believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts is not significant as of june          the table below discloses the

         june                          notes a reported as interest expense b reported as other income   note  – variable interest entities vie   as noted in note  first united corporation created the trusts for the purposes of raising regulatory capital through the sale of mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities to third party investors and common equity interests to first united corporation the trusts are considered variable interest entities “vies” but are not consolidated because first united corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts at march   the corporation reported all of the  million of tps debentures issued in connection with these offerings as longterm borrowings along with the  million of standalone junior subordinated debentures and it reported its  million equity interest in the trusts as “other assets”   in november  the bank became a  limited partner in liberty mews limited partnership the “partnership” a maryland limited partnership formed for the purpose of acquiring developing and operating lowincome housing units in garrett county maryland the partnership was financed with a total of  million of funding including a  million equity contribution from the bank as the limited partner the partnership used the proceeds from these sources to purchase the land and construct a unit low income housing rental complex at a total cost of  million the total assets of the partnership were approximately  million at june   and  million at december     as of december   the bank had made contributions to the partnership totaling  million the project was completed in june  and the bank is entitled to  million in federal investment tax credits over a year period as long as certain qualifying hurdles are maintained the bank will also receive the benefit of tax operating losses from the partnership to the extent of its capital contribution the investment in the partnership assists the bank in achieving its community reinvestment initiatives   because the partnership is considered to be a vie management performed an analysis to determine whether its involvement with the partnership would lead it to determine that it must consolidate the partnership in performing its analysis management evaluated the risks creating the variability in the partnership and identified which activities most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance finally it examined each of the variable interest holders to determine which if any of the holders was the primary beneficiary based on their power to direct the most significant activities and their obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the partnership   the bank as a limited partner generally has no voting rights the bank is not in any way involved in the daily management of the partnership and has no other rights that provide it with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the partnership’s economic performance which are to develop and operate the housing project in such a manner that complies with specific tax credit guidelines as a limited partner there is no recourse to the bank by the creditors of the partnership the tax credits that result from the bank’s investment in the partnership are generally subject to recapture should the partnership fail to comply with the applicable government regulations the bank has not provided any financial or other support to the partnership beyond its required capital contributions and does not anticipate providing such support in the future management currently believes that no material losses are probable as a result of the bank’s investment in the partnership        on the basis of management’s analysis the general partner is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the partnership because the bank is not the primary beneficiary the partnership has not been included in the corporation’s consolidated financial statements   at june   and december   the corporation included its total investment in the partnership in “other assets” in its consolidated statement of financial condition as of june   the corporation’s commitment in the partnership was fully funded the following table presents details of the bank’s involvement with the partnership at the dates indicated       june      december    in thousands           investment in lihtc partnership                 carrying amount on balance sheet of                 investment other assets             maximum exposure to loss                 note  – assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements   interest rate swap agreements “swap agreements”   the corporation has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain interestbearing liabilities as a part of managing interest rate risk the swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition the swap agreements were entered into with a third party financial institution the corporation is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparty however the corporation does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes the master netting arrangements provide for a single net settlement of all swap agreements as well as collateral in the event of default on or termination of any one contract collateral in the form of cash is posted by the corporation as the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds see note  to the consolidated financial statements for more information   securities sold under agreements to repurchase “repurchase agreements”   the bank enters into agreements under which it sells interests in us securities to certain customers subject to an obligation to repurchase and on the part of the customers to resell such interests under these arrangements the bank may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the bank to repurchase the assets as a result these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements ie secured borrowings and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities the obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the consolidated statement of condition while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities in addition as the bank does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements there is no such offsetting to be done with the repurchase agreements the right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the bank be in default ie fails to repurchase the us securities on the maturity date of the agreement the investment security collateral is held by a third party financial institution in the counterparty’s custodial account        the following table presents the liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or repurchase agreements as of june   and december                           gross

accounting standards and effects of new accounting pronouncements   in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no  “disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” the new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial condition as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement asu no  also requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements in january  the fasb issued asu no  “clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” the provisions of asu no  limit the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosures to the following financial instruments to the extent they are offset in the financial statements or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in the statement of financial condition a derivative financial instruments b repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and c securities borrowing and securities lending transactions the corporation adopted the provisions of asu no  and asu no  effective january   as the provisions of asu no  and asu no  only impacted the disclosure requirements related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities and information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial condition the adoption had no impact on the corporations’ consolidated statements of income and condition see note  to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by asu no  and asu no    in february  the fasb issued asu no  “reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income” to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications asu no  does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements asu no  requires an entity to disaggregate the total change of each component of other comprehensive income and separately present reclassification adjustments and current period other comprehensive income the provisions of asu no  also require that entities present in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line item affected by the reclassification if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety entities would instead crossreference to the related note to the financial statements for additional information the corporation adopted the provisions of asu no  effective january   as the corporation provided these required disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the adoption of asu no  had no impact on the corporation’s consolidated statements of income and condition see note  to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by asu no         in july  the fasb issued asu  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  in july  the fasb issued asu  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss “nol” carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  the asu is intended to eliminate diversity in practice resulting from a lack of guidance on this topic in current gaap under the asu an entity generally must present an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for an nol carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   the adoption of this asu will not have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operation   item  managements

as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec   estimates and critical accounting policies   this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities see note  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  of part ii of first united corporation’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   on an ongoing basis management evaluates estimates including those related to loan losses and intangible assets otherthantemporary impairment “otti” of investment securities income taxes fair value of investments and pension plan assumptions management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements   allowance for loan losses   one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses the “all” the valuation of underlying collateral the timing of loan chargeoffs and the placement of loans on nonaccrual status the all is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio current and historical trends in delinquencies and chargeoffs and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction changes in lending rates political conditions legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia because the calculation of the all relies on management’s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events actual results may differ from management’s estimates   goodwill and other intangible assets   financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification “asc” topic  intangibles  goodwill and other  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill  the  million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of huntington national bank branches that occurred in  and is not subject to periodic amortization    goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the corporation’s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets including goodwill  if the estimated current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded otherwise additional testing is performed and to the extent such additional testing results in a conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss is recognized   our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and that value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality cost effective services in a highly competitive local market  this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems the development of valueadded service features and the ease of use of our services  as such goodwill value is ultimately supported by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted  a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill which could adversely impact earnings in future periods  asc topic  requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment  the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and estimates         accounting for income taxes   first united corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” under this guidance deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date   management regularly reviews the carrying amount of its net deferred tax assets to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the company’s net deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods a deferred tax valuation allowance would be established consideration is given to various positive and negative factors that could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets in evaluating this available evidence management considers among other things historical performance expectations of future earnings the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid length of statutory carry forward periods experience with utilization of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring tax planning strategies and timing of reversals of temporary differences significant judgment is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences the corporation’s evaluation is based on current tax laws as well as management’s expectations of future performance   management expects that first united corporation’s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of changes in judgment or measurement including changes in actual and forecasted income before taxes tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies   otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities   management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis based upon application of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in asc topic  section  management assesses whether a the corporation has the intent to sell a security being evaluated and b it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery if neither applies then declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are considered otherthantemporary declines are split into two components the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made the second component consists of all other losses which are recognized in other comprehensive loss in estimating otti losses management considers  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security an industry or a geographic area  the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments and  the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future management also monitors cash flow projections for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of asc subtopic  investments – other – beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  asc section  this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review   fair value of investments   we have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements the corporation measures the fair market values of its investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in topic  the determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in note  to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report        pension plan assumptions   our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts as discussed within the requirements of asc topic  compensation – retirement benefits pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics such as retirement patterns employee turnover mortality rates and estimated employer compensation increases these factors along with the critical assumptions are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries further information about our pension plan assumptions the plan’s funded status and other plan information is included in note  to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report   other than as discussed above management does not believe that any material changes in our critical accounting policies have occurred since december     selected financial data   the following table sets forth certain selected financial data for the

net loss for the first six months of  to net income for the first six months in  was primarily due to a  million decrease in the provision for loan losses during the first six months of  when compared to the same time period of  this decrease was offset by a decrease in net gains of  million due to reduced gains on sales of investment securities and a decrease of  million in other income due to a reduction in bankowned life insurance “boli” income driven by a onetime death benefit of  million that occurred in march  total other operating expenses increased  million during the first six months

was    the provision for loan losses decreased to  million for the six months ended june   compared to  million for the same period of  the lower provision expense thus far in  was primarily due to a loan chargeoff of  million on a shared national credit for an ethanol plant in western pennsylvania during the first quarter of  and chargeoffs of  million on a participation loan for a hotel located in hazleton pennsylvania and  million on a motel located in salisbury maryland during the first quarter of  for the first six months of  we continued to see a leveling in the credit quality of our loan portfolio as we experienced fewer loan downgrades and delinquency levels have improved specific allocations have been made for impaired loans where management has determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance and the qualitative factors affecting the all have been adjusted based on the current economic environment and the characteristics of the loan portfolio        interest expense on our interestbearing liabilities decreased  million during the six months ended june   when compared to the same period of  due primarily to a decrease of  million in average interestbearing deposits and a  million decrease in average longterm debt outstanding the decline in average interestbearing deposits and average longterm debt was due to the repayment of  million in brokered certificates of deposit and the repayment of  million in federal home loan bank “fhlb” advances at their stated maturities respectively during  the bank’s treasury team will continue to monitor rates on our deposits and increases special pricing only for full relationship customers our retail staff continues to be focused on shifting our deposit mix away from higher cost certificates of deposit and towards lower cost money market and transaction accounts   other operating income decreased  million during the first six months of  when compared to the same period of  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in boli income due to the onetime death benefit of  million received in march  net gains declined  million during the first six months of  when compared to the first six months of  due to a reduction in gains on sales of investment securities   operating expenses increased  million in the first six months of  when compared to the same period of  this increase was due to a  million reduction in gains on sales of oreo offset by a reduction of approximately  million in salaries and benefits due to reduced health insurance costs and incentives and a decrease of  million in other miscellaneous expenses   consolidated net income available to common shareholders was  million or  per common share for the second quarter of

compared to the same period of  this decrease was due to a  million reduction in salaries and benefits related to reduced health insurance costs and incentives   net interest income   net interest income is the largest source of operating revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets and the interest expense incurred on interestbearing liabilities for analytical and discussion purposes net interest income is adjusted to a fte basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and taxexempt assets fte income is determined by increasing taxexempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate        the following table sets forth the

interest income was primarily due to the  million reduction in the average balance of loans when comparing the first six months of  to the same period of  the slightly lower yield on both loans and investment securities as funds were reinvested also contributed to the decline in interest income when comparing the two periods the decline in interest income was partially offset by a decline in

the rate so determined should be used in providing for income taxes on a current yeartodate basis the effective tax rate should reflect anticipated investment tax credits capital gains rates and other available tax planning alternatives in arriving at this effective tax rate however no effect should be included for the tax related to significant unusual or extraordinary items that will be

management’s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio assessment of current economic conditions diversification and size of the portfolio adequacy of collateral past and anticipated loss experience and the amount of nonperforming loans         the all is also based on estimates and actual losses will vary from current estimates these estimates are reviewed quarterly and as adjustments either positive or negative become necessary a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the all the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the all is consistent with prior years an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment   the following table presents a summary of the activity in the all for the six months ended

losses inherent in our loan portfolio amounts that will be recorded for the provision for loan losses in future periods will depend upon trends in the loan balances including the composition of the loan portfolio changes in loan quality and loss experience trends potential recoveries on previously chargedoff loans and changes in other qualitative factors management also applies interest rate

impaired and loss has been recognized in accordance with asc section    the terms of the debentures underlying trust preferred securities allow the issuer of the debentures to defer interest payments for up to  quarters and in such case the terms of the related trust preferred securities allow their issuers to defer dividend payments for up to  quarters some of the issuers of the trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio have defaulted andor deferred payments ranging from  to  of the total collateral balances underlying the securities the securities were designed to include structural features that provide investors with credit enhancement or support to provide default protection by subordinated tranches these features include overcollateralization of the notes or subordination excess interest or spread which will redirect funds in situations where collateral is insufficient and a specified order of principal payments there are securities in our portfolio that are undercollateralized which does represent additional stress on our tranche however in these cases the terms of the securities require excess interest to be redirected from subordinate tranches as credit support which provides additional support to our investment   management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis based upon application of asc topic  section  management must assess whether a the corporation has the intent to sell the security and b it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery if neither applies then declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are considered otherthantemporary declines are split into two components the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made the second component consists of all other losses the other losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in estimating otti charges management considers  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security an industry or a geographic area  the historic and implied volatility of the security  changes in the rating of a security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments and  the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future due to the duration and the significant market value decline in the pooled trust preferred securities held in our portfolio we performed more extensive testing on these securities for purposes of evaluating whether or not an otti has occurred        the market for these securities as of june   is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bidask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels the new issue market is also inactive as no new cdos have been issued since  there are currently very few market participants who are willing to effect transactions in these securities the market values for these securities or any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the us department of the treasury the “treasury” are very depressed relative to historical levels therefore in the current market a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general rather than being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue given the conditions in the current debt markets and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets management has determined that a the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of obtaining fair value at june   b an income valuation approach technique ie present value that maximizes the use of relevant unobservable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than a market approach and c the cdo segment is appropriately classified within level  of the valuation hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date   management utilizes an independent third party to prepare both the evaluations of otti and the fair value determinations for the cdo portfolio management does not believe that there were any material differences in the otti evaluations and pricing between december   and june     the approach used by the third party to determine fair value involved several steps including detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in each bond default recovery and prepaymentamortization probabilities for each piece of collateral in the bond and discounted cash flow modeling the discount rate methodology used by the third party combines a baseline current market yield for comparable corporate and structured credit products with adjustments based on evaluations of the differences found in structure and risks associated with actual and projected credit performance of each cdo being valued currently the only active and liquid trading market that exists is for standalone trust preferred securities therefore adjustments to the baseline discount rate are also made to reflect the additional leverage found in structured instruments   based upon a review of credit quality and the cash flow tests performed by the independent third party management determined that no securities had creditrelated otti during the first six months of    the riskbased capital ratios require that banks set aside additional capital for securities that are rated below investment grade securities rated one level below investment grade require a  risk weighting additional methods are applicable to securities rated more than one level below investment grade management believes that as of june   we maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to cover the additional capital requirements of these securities and future operating expenses additionally we do not anticipate any material commitments

liquidity management   liquidity is a financial institution’s capability to meet customer demands for deposit withdrawals while funding all creditworthy loans the factors that determine the institution’s liquidity are   · reliability and stability of core deposits · cash flow structure and pledging status of investments and · potential for unexpected loan demand   we actively manage our liquidity position through weekly meetings of a subcommittee of executive management known as the treasury subcommittee which looks forward  months at day intervals the measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by the asset and liability committee under prescribed policies and procedures are designed to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds   it is our policy to manage our affairs so that liquidity needs are fully satisfied through normal bank operations that is the bank will manage its liquidity to minimize the need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions the bank will use funding sources where the interest cost is relatively insensitive to market changes in the short run periods of one year or less to satisfy operating cash needs the remaining normal funding will come from interestsensitive liabilities either deposits or borrowed funds when the marginal cost of needed wholesale funding is lower than the cost of raising this funding in the retail markets the corporation may supplement retail funding with external funding sources such as    unsecured fed funds lines of credit with upstream correspondent banks mt bank atlantic central banker’s bank community banker’s bank  secured advances with the fhlb of atlanta which are collateralized by eligible one to four family residential mortgage loans home equity lines of credit commercial real estate loans and various securities cash may also be pledged as collateral  secured line of credit with the fed discount window for use in borrowing funds up to  days using municipal securities as collateral  brokered deposits including cds and money market funds provide a method to generate deposits quickly these deposits are strictly rate driven but often provide the most cost effective means of funding growth         one way buy cdars funding – a form of brokered deposits that has become a viable supplement to brokered deposits obtained directly   management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands and is not aware of any trends or demands commitments events or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels   market risk and interest sensitivity   our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in such as gathering deposits and extending loans many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interestbearing assets and liabilities management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interestearning asset and interestbearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date the differences between total interestsensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income as more assets than liabilities will reprice a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates   at june   we were asset sensitive   our interest rate risk management goals are   · ensure that the board of directors and senior management will provide effective oversight and ensure that risks are adequately identified measured monitored and controlled · enable dynamic measurement and management of interest rate risk · select strategies that optimize our ability to meet our longrange financial goals while maintaining interest rate risk within policy limits established by the board of directors · use both income and market value oriented techniques to select strategies that optimize the relationship between risk and return and · establish interest rate risk exposure limits for fluctuation in net interest income “nii” net income and economic value of equity   in order to manage interest sensitivity risk management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing funding sources and pricing and offbalance sheet commitments these guidelines are based on management’s outlook regarding future interest rate movements the state of the regional and national economy and other financial and business risk factors management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities changes in asset volumes and pricing and management’s capital plans this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods   we evaluate the effect of a change in interest rates of  basis points to  basis points on both nii and net portfolio value “npv”  economic value of equity “eve” we concentrate on nii rather than net income as long as nii remains the significant contributor to net income   nii modeling allows management to view how changes in interest rates will affect the spread between the yield paid on assets and the cost of deposits and borrowed funds unlike traditional gap modeling nii modeling takes into account the different degree to which installments in the same repricing period will adjust to a change in interest rates it also allows the use of different assumptions in a falling versus a rising rate environment the period considered by the nii modeling is the next eight quarters   npv  eve modeling focuses on the change in the market value of equity npv  eve is defined as the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities plusminus the market value of any offbalance sheet positions by effectively looking at the present value of all future cash flows on or off the balance sheet npv  eve modeling takes a longerterm view of interest rate risk this complements the shorterterm view of the nii modeling        measures of nii at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution’s shortterm performance in alternative rate environments these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period usually one year they do not necessarily indicate the longterm prospects or economic value of the institution   capital resources   the bank and first united corporation are subject to riskbased capital regulations which were adopted and are monitored by federal banking regulators these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution’s asset risk profile and offbalance sheet exposures such as unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier  capital consisting of common shareholders’ equity qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities and perpetual preferred stock less goodwill and certain other deductions the remaining capital or tier  capital consists of elements such as subordinated debt mandatory convertible debt remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities and grandfathered senior debt plus the all subject to certain limitations   under the riskbased capital regulations banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum total riskbased capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by riskweighted assets of   for well capitalized banks including a tier  ratio of at least   for well capitalized banks the riskbased capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio defined as tier i capital divided by average assets after certain adjustments the minimum leverage ratio is   for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have welldiversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure excellent asset quality high liquidity and good earnings and between  and  for other institutions depending on their particular condition and growth plans regulators may require higher capital ratios when warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization in the current regulatory environment banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable riskbased deposit insurance assessments our capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities   the following table presents our capital ratios                   required for                         capital     required to

from the regulators categorized first united corporation and the bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action all capital ratios increased at june   when compared to december     basel is a committee of central banks and bank regulators from major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country’s regulators with the purpose of ensuring that financial institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments   on july   the federal reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory riskbased capital rules applicable to first united corporation the fdic and the occ have subsequently approved these rules the final rules were adopted following the issuance of proposed rules by the federal reserve in june  and implement the “basel iii” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the doddfrank act “basel iii” refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december  the rules text released in december  and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital leverage and liquidity requirements        the rules include new riskbased capital and leverage ratios which would be phased in from  to  and would refine the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios the new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the corporation under the final rules would be i a new common equity tier  capital ratio of  ii a tier  capital ratio of  increased from  iii a total capital ratio of  unchanged from current rules and iv a tier  leverage ratio of  for all institutions the final rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements which must consist entirely of common equity tier  capital the capital conservation buffer will be phasedin over four years beginning on january   as follows the maximum buffer will be  of riskweighted assets for   for   for  and  for  and thereafter this will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in  i a common equity tier  capital ratio of  ii a tier  capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of  under the final rules institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount these limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions   basel iii provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer the “countercyclical buffer” of up to  of common equity tier  capital to take into account the macrofinancial environment and periods of excessive credit growth however the final rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to “advanced approach banks”  ie  banks with  billion or more in total assets or  billion or more in total foreign exposures which currently excludes the corporation the final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with basel iii regarding the various components of tier  capital including common equity unrealized gains and losses as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as tier  capital some of which will be phased out over time however the final rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than  billion in total assets as of december   which includes the corporation will be able to permanently include nonqualifying instruments that were issued and included in tier  or tier  capital prior to may   in additional tier  or tier  capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature   the final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness these revisions take effect january   under the prompt corrective action requirements which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized” i a new common equity tier  capital ratio of  ii a tier  capital ratio of  increased from  iii a total capital ratio of  unchanged from current rules and iv a tier  leverage ratio of  increased from    the final rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of riskweighted assets which we will be required to utilize beginning january   the standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights and also addresses i an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with section a of the doddfrank act act ii revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation iii rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans iv revised capital treatment for derivatives and repostyle transactions and v disclosure requirements for toptier banking organizations with  billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the “advance approach rules” that apply to banks with greater than  billion in consolidated assets based on our current capital composition and levels we believe that we would be in compliance with the requirements as set forth in the final rules if they were presently in effect   the total risk based capital ratios of first united corporation include  million of junior subordinated debentures “tps debentures” which qualified as tier  capital at june   under guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system   in january  p ursuant to the treasury’s troubled asset relief program capital purchase program first united corporation sold  shares of its series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of its common stock having an exercise price of  per share to the treasury for an aggregate purchase price of  million the proceeds from this transaction count as tier  capital and the warrant qualifies as tangible common equity information about the terms of these securities is provided in note  to the consolidated financial statements        the terms of the series a preferred stock call for the payment if declared by the board of directors of first united corporation of a quarterly cash dividend on february  th  may  th  august  th and november  th of each year at the request of the reserve bank first united corporation deferred the payment of cash dividends on the series a preferred stock beginning with the payment that was due on november   as of june   this deferral election remained in effect and dividends of  million per quarterly dividend period continue to accrue first united corporation will be required to pay all accrued and unpaid dividends if and when the board of directors declares and pays the next quarterly cash dividend management cannot predict whether or when the board of directors will resume quarterly cash dividends on the series a preferred stock first united corporation’s ability to make dividend payments in the future will depend primarily on our earnings in future periods   on december   also at the request of the reserve bank the board of directors of first united corporation elected to defer quarterly interest payments under the tps debentures beginning with the payments that were due in march  as of june   this deferral election remained in effect and cumulative deferred interest was approximately  million which has been fully accrued and must be paid in full when the board of directors elects to terminate the deferral first united corporation’s ability to resume quarterly interest payments will depend primarily on our earnings in future periods accordingly no assurance can be given as to if or when first united corporation will resume the payment of interest under the tps debentures   in connection with and as a result of the aforementioned deferrals the board of directors of first united corporation voted to suspend the declaration of quarterly cash dividends on the common stock until further notice the payment of cash dividends on the common stock is at the discretion of the board of directors and is dependent on our earnings in future periods in addition cash dividends on the common stock may be paid only if all accrued and unpaid interest due under the tps debentures and all accrued and unpaid dividends due under the series a preferred stock have been paid in full there can be no assurance as to if or when first united corporation will resume the payment of cash dividends on the common stock   contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements   loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of our customers letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur the credit risks inherent in loan commitments and letters of credit are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers and these arrangements are subject to our normal credit policies loan commitments and letters of credit totaled  million and  million respectively at june   compared to  million and  million respectively at december   we are not a party to any other offbalance sheet arrangements   see note  to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report for further disclosure on borrowed funds there have been no other significant changes to contractual obligations as presented at december     item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation and we have procedures in place to evaluate and mitigate this risk this market risk and our procedures are described above in item  of part i of this report under the caption “ market risk and interest sensitivity ” and in item  of part ii of first united corporation’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the caption “market risk and interest sensitivity” management believes that no material changes in our procedures used to evaluate and mitigate these risks have occurred since december   we believe the investment portfolio restructuring has better positioned the corporation for a rising interest rate environment   item  controls and procedures   we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of  with the sec such as this quarterly report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the periods specified in those rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer “ceo” and the chief financial officer “cfo” as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate        an evaluation of the effectiveness of these disclosure controls as of june   was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management including the ceo and the cfo based on that evaluation management including the ceo and the cfo has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are in fact effective at the reasonable assurance level   during the first six months of  there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting        part
