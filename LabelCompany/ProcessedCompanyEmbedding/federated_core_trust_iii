obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or for an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  the trust was organized as a delaware statutory trust on august   and filed form na on july   on july   the trust filed form na to register its nondiversified series federated project and finance core fund the “fund” under the act  the adviser a whollyowned subsidiary of federated investors inc is an investment adviser registered under the investment advisers act of  the adviser will serve as investment adviser to the fund  the investment objective of the fund will be to provide total return comprised primarily from income arising out of investment in tradefinance and related securities and instruments the fund will invest primarily in trade structuredtrade export and project finance or related assets of companies or other entities including sovereign entities located in developed markets as well as emerging markets applicants expect that a substantial portion of the funds assets will consist of a variety of trade finance securities and instruments that may not be readily sold and converted to cash within seven days the funds investments however although less liquid than permissible for an openend investment company in the absence of exemptive relief will not be illiquid on a relative basis the board of trustees “board” of the fund will approve written procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the funds portfolio assets are sufficiently liquid so that the fund can comply with its fundamental policy on redemptions taking into account current market conditions and the funds investment objectives the board will review the procedures and the overall composition of the portfolio at least annually  shares of the fund will not be registered under the securities act of  the “ act” they will be offered and sold only in private start printed page placement transactions to “accredited investors” as defined in regulation d of the  act that are also “qualified purchasers” as defined in section a of the act and the rules thereunder “qualified purchasers” applicants anticipate that the fund will serve initially as a “core fund” that would provide access to this asset class to other registered investment companies both within and outside the federated group of investment companies the fund will adopt a policy to permit the transfer of its shares only to other qualified purchasers  applicants have determined to register the fund under the act rather than rely on section c of the act in order to offer the acts protections to the registered funds and other investors that will invest in the fund applicants will register the fund under the act as an openend rather than as a closedend investment company because the funds portfolio will be liquid enough to accept redemption requests daily and pay redemption proceeds within  days thereafter applicants state that a closedend fund would not be able to offer redeemable securities and could tend to trade in the aftermarket at a discount to nav  the fund seeks exemptions from section e of the act and rule c under the act to the extent necessary to permit the fund to operate as an extended payment fund as such the fund will accept redemption requests daily price shares tendered for redemption  days after receipt of the tender the “redemption pricing date” and pay redemption proceeds within thirtyone days after a redemption request the “redemption payment date” shares tendered for redemption will participate proportionately in the funds gains and losses during the period of time between the notice of tender for redemption and the redemption pricing date  the fund will adopt a fundamental policy specifying its redemption procedures including the timing of key redemption dates this policy will be disclosed in the funds offering memorandum modification of this policy will require authorization by the vote of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities and approval by the commission or its staff applicants legal analysis  rule c under the act generally requires a registered openend investment company to sell redeem or repurchase its securities at the price based on the current nav of such security next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption applicants state that rule c was designed primarily to address the practice of “backward pricing” of fund shares that practice involved pricing fund shares for purchase or redemption based on the nav determined prior to the purchase or redemption request this pricing mechanism enabled a funds insiders to engage in “riskless trading” by buying shares at an nav that they knew was likely to increase because of market action after the shares were priced applicants assert that in effect backward pricing created the possibility that some investors could trade fund shares at the expense of nonredeeming shareholders rule c eliminates this problem by requiring “forward pricing” or pricing fund shares at the close of the market after a purchase or redemption request is received under rule c an openend equity fund typically computes the value of shares tendered for redemption on any given day at  pm on that day  applicants propose that the fund redeem shares at the nav per share calculated  days after the shares are tendered applicants assert that their proposal does not raise the concern of “backward pricing” because shares will be priced only after a tender for redemption is received applicants state that the funds pricing timeline will be clearly disclosed and is consistent with the act because it will treat all investors equally and not dilute nonredeeming shareholders interests in addition all investors in the fund will be qualified purchasers who are capable of understanding the risks presented by the funds redemption policy  section e of the act provides that a registered investment company may not suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption of any redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after the tender of the security to the company applicants request an exemption from section e to permit the fund to pay redemption proceeds within  days after the redemption pricing date or  days after the tender of shares for redemption  applicants state that the primary purpose of section e is to address the abusive practices of early openend companies that claimed that their securities were redeemable only to then institute barriers to redemption applicants represent that the funds policies will not raise the possibility of such abuses the funds redemption policy will be a fundamental policy changeable only by a majority vote of its shareholders and the approval of the commission or its staff applicants undertake to disclose the funds redemption policy on the cover page of its offering memorandum and in any marketing materials and to refrain from holding itself out as a “mutual fund” most importantly the fund will limit its investors to qualified purchasers who are highly sophisticated investors capable of understanding the funds redemption policy and its associated risks  in  the commission proposed rule e under the act that set forth an “extended payment fund” structure identical to that proposed for the fund the commissions proposal was designed to permit a registered investment company that could both offer redeemable securities and invest in assets including less liquid foreign securities that did not meet the sevenday liquidity standard for traditional openend funds  under proposed rule e an openend fund could make payment upon redemption of its securities up to  days after tender of the securities to the fund at nav determined on the next redemption pricing date following the tender provided that a the fund did so pursuant to a fundamental policy setting forth the number of days between a tender and the next redemption pricing and payment dates changeable only with approval of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities b at least  of the funds assets consisted of assets that either i may be sold in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price used to compute the funds nav within the period between the tender and the next redemption payment date or ii mature by the next redemption payment date and c the fund does not hold itself out to investors as a mutual fund the fund will comply with these requirements  section c of the act permits the commission to exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the start printed page act if the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies of the act applicants believe that the relief is appropriate because the fund can provide a convenient and costeffective means of accessing certain asset classes that provide potentially favorable returns and can produce administrative and other efficiencies and diversify risk across a number of investments applicants also believe that the requested relief is consistent with the protection of investors because shares of the fund will be available only to qualified purchasers finally applicants state that the relief is consistent with the purposes intended by the policies of the act because as discussed above it does not raise the concerns addressed by section e of the act and rule c thereunder applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the funds outstanding securities will be owned exclusively by persons who are qualified purchasers as defined in section a of the act and the rules thereunder  the fund will adopt a fundamental policy which may be changed only by a majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of the fund and only upon approval by the commission or its staff that will specify the circumstances in which the fund will redeem its shares such that a the fund will have a  day rolling deadline to pay redemptions after a shareholder has requested redemption and b will calculate its nav applicable to a redemption request on the next redemption pricing date following a redemption request which will be  days after a shareholder has requested redemption  at least  of the assets of the fund will consist of assets a that the fund reasonably believes may be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price used in computing the funds nav within the period between a tender of shares and the next redemption payment date or b that mature by the next redemption payment date  the board of the fund including a majority of the disinterested trustees will adopt written procedures designed to ensure that the fund will comply with the terms and conditions of the requested order the board will review these procedures at least annually and approve such changes as it

and federated securities corp each an adviser and collectively the advisers and all future investment companies for which persons controlling controlled by or under common control with federated investors inc a pennsylvania corporation serve as investment adviser together with the federated funds the “funds” and individually each a fund  the funds and the advisers are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “applicants” the order sought herein would exempt securities transactions defined below between a fund and an affiliated dealer from the restrictions of section a and d of the act and rule d thereunder for purposes of this application the term “affiliated dealer” is defined to include any person or any affiliated person of a person who is an affiliated person of any of the funds solely because such person directly or indirectly owns controls or holds five percent  or more of the outstanding voting securities of any of the funds and is a i brokerdealer registered under the securities exchange act of  the “ act” or ii bank exempt from such registration pursuant to sections ab and ac of the  act and regulations promulgated thereunder the “securities transactions” that are the subject of the requested order are  primary and secondary market transactions in fixedincome securities  executed on a principal basis as discussed in section v below between the funds and an affiliated dealer and  certain types of transactions as discussed in section v below in which the funds and an affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons might each participate jointly or have a joint interest sometimes referred to as “joint transactions”  no fund will engage in securities transactions with any affiliated dealer which controls such fund within the meaning of section a of the act the relief sought hereunder will not apply if the provisions of the act would restrict the transactions because an affiliated dealer is a principal underwriter or promoter of a fund the order requested herein is subject to certain additional conditions as more fully described below applicants believe these conditions preclude the possibility of overreaching by an affiliated dealer applicants request relief hereunder only for transactions that would be restricted by section a and d of the act and rule d thereunder solely because an affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof owns controls or holds  or more of the outstanding voting securities of any of the funds the relief sought hereunder will not apply where an affiliated dealer is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person a “secondtier affiliate” of a fund for reasons other than such an interest additionally the relief sought hereunder will not apply if the above provisions would restrict the transactions because an affiliated dealer is a principal underwriter or promoter of a fund the order would not cover any securities transactions between a fund and an affiliated dealer who or an affiliated person of whom advises promotes or acts as a principal underwriter of the fund ii description of the applicants a   the funds each fund is an openend or closedend management investment company registered under the act and is organized as a statutory trust business trust or corporation under the laws of delaware maryland or massachusetts the funds have a variety of investment objectives but each of the funds may to a greater or lesser degree invest a portion of its assets in fixedincome securities the fixedincome securities in which the funds may invest include but are not limited to government securities municipal securities tender option bonds taxable and taxexempt money market securities repurchase agreements asset and mortgagebacked securities corporate issues and syndicated loans including assignments thereof and participations therein each as the funds’ respective investment policies allow b   the advisers the advisers are direct or indirect whollyowned subsidiaries of federated investors inc federated a pennsylvania corporation federated is one of the largest investment managers in the united states and provides comprehensive investment management services to approximately  institutions and intermediaries each adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended the “advisers act” the advisers act as investment advisers to each of the funds and may supervise one or more affiliated or unaffiliated subadvisers with respect to certain funds each fund and its adviser have entered into an investment management agreement pursuant to which the adviser is responsible for managing the fund’s investment portfolio subject to the supervision of the board of directors board of trustees or other governing body of such fund as applicable each a “board” making investment decisions on behalf of the fund and placing its transactions each of the advisers has adopted confidentiality policies designed to limit the unnecessary flow of information about client holdings and transactions pursuant to these policies information regarding investment advisory and portfolio execution matters relating to the funds are considered by the advisers as information that may not be communicated outside of such adviser except as necessary eg to a potential executing broker or dealer on an actual trade in general prior to any public disclosure and consistent with an adviser’s fiduciary duty to the fund information concerning fund portfolio holdings is considered confidential and may only be shared by a fund’s adviser for a legitimate business purpose with certain types of parties and then upon prior approval by the fund’s board or by a committee set up to evaluate such circumstances iii separa t ion between the advisers and the affiliated dealers the advisers are organized and operated as distinct legal entities from the affiliated dealers    no affiliated dealer will have any involvement with respect to proposed transactions pursuant to the order nor will any affiliated dealer attempt to influence or control in any way the placing by the funds or the advisers of orders relating to securities transactions  furthermore officers and employees of the advisers may not communicate confidential and nonpublic investmentrelated information outside of the advisers and their mutual fund service provider affiliates  such “information barriers” are designed to control and prevent the dissemination of confidential and material nonpublic information by employees who receive such nonpublic information during the course of their employment the funds and their investors are also protected from any undue influence among other things by the complete separation and independent operation of the advisers from the affiliated dealers independent operation generally consists of separate legal entities with separate capitalizations separate books and records separate officers and employees physically separate offices and a compensation system that does not reward employees based on i a factor that treats the affiliated dealers differently than unaffiliated counterparties for example no adviser will provide any additional compensation to any employee solely based on such employee’s transacting business with a affiliated dealer that would not generally be provided to employees performing similarly with respect to transactions with unaffiliated parties or ii the amount of business done by the funds with the affiliated dealers except to the extent such business might affect indirectly the profits or losses of the advisers such as where securities transactions result in higher profits to a fund that increase the net asset value of such fund based upon which an adviser generally receives a percentage fee in light of the entity separation described above the applicants submit that the affiliated dealers will not be in a position to cause any securities transaction by the funds that separation is required to be maintained for so long as the order is relied upon by the “conditions” described in section ix below further among other things those conditions prohibit the advisers or their affiliated persons from consulting with the affiliated dealers regarding potential transactions beyond the extent normally carried out with unaffiliated parties in the normal course of business moreover there is not and will not be any express or implied understanding between the advisers and any affiliated dealer that will cause a fund to enter into securities transactions or give preference to the affiliated dealer in effecting such transactions between the funds and the affiliated dealer all decisions by the funds to enter into portfolio transactions are determined solely by their respective advisers in accordance with the investment objectives of the fund in that regard trade execution for the funds is the responsibility of one or more individuals employed solely by their respective advisers and the advisers will continue to adhere to a best execution standard portfolio managers employed by the advisers will not be affiliated persons of any affiliated dealer prior to any purchase or sale decision the portfolio manager at an adviser will independently evaluate any research provided by brokerdealers including unaffiliated brokerdealers and other analysts and determine his or her own recommendations in addition a major determinant of the compensation of a portfolio manager at any adviser is the performance of the fund or funds for which he or she has responsibility in no instance would his or her compensation be affected by the amount of business done by funds he or she manages with the affiliated dealers furthermore as required by rule bhii the funds have adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent the persons responsible for selecting brokers and dealers to effect the funds’ securities transactions from taking into account the brokers’ and dealers’ promotion or sale of the funds’ shares therefore the sale of any or all of the funds’ shares by an affiliated dealer shall not be taken into consideration when a portfolio manager at any adviser is determining whether to enter into a securities transaction with such affiliated dealer in summary the advisers will continue to operate independently of the affiliated dealers in performing portfolio management services for the funds and the affiliated dealers will not have any influence over those services iv consolidation in the financial services industry a   the impact of consolidation significant consolidation has occurred in the banking and investment banking brokerdealer industries blurring the line between the two industries referred to herein collectively as the “financial services” industry both conceptually and in practice a  paper published by the brookings institution reported that from  to  the banking industry was transformed by “the massive reduction in the number of banking organizations the significant increase in the number of failures the dramatic rise in offbalance sheet activities the major expansion in lending to us corporations by foreign banks    and the opening up of interstate banking markets”  nearly a decade later an article in the fdic banking review asserted that “over the two decades  the structure of the us banking industry indeed underwent an almost unprecedented transformation—one marked by a substantial decline in the number of commercial banks and savings institutions and by a growing concentration of industry assets among a few dozen extremely large financial institutions”  indeed consolidation in the financial services industry continued from  accelerating during the credit crisis that began in  consolidation in the financial services industry combined with an increase in industry assets has resulted in a few major brokerdealers accounting for a large percentage of the market share in connection with trading in various asset classes  in march  jp morgan chase  co “jp morgan” acquired the bear stearns companies inc the us’s fifth largest investment bank later in  lehman brothers holdings inc “lehman brothers” filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and merrill lynch  co was acquired by bank of america corporation “bank of america” these transactions resulted in only two remaining major “pure” investment banks brokerdealers the goldman sachs group inc “goldman sachs” and morgan stanley these companies registered as bank holding companies in september  also in  jp morgan acquired washington mutual fifth third bank acquired first charter bank pnc financial services acquired national city corp us bankcorp acquired downey savings wells fargo  company acquired former competitor wachovia corporation and barclays bank plc “barclays” agreed to purchase certain core capital markets businesses of lehman brothers b   consolidation has increased the applicants’ need for relief the aforementioned companies including citigroup jp morgan goldman sachs morgan stanley bank of america merrill lynch barclays ubs and wells fargo all ranked in the top ten managing underwriters of us high yield debt us municipal new issues excluding ubs and us debt excluding wells fargo through the nine months ended september    citigroup jp morgan goldman sachs morgan stanley bank of america merrill lynch barclays and ubs also ranked in the top ten managing underwriters of global debt while wells fargo ranked  st through the first three quarters of   citigroup jp morgan bank of america merrill lynch barclays and wells fargo also ranked in the top ten managing underwriters of global assetbacked securities through the nine months ended september      these managers underwrote over  of the debt securities issued in the us during this nine month period none of the managers had a us market share of less than   underwriters traditionally act as the principal market makers for their offerings so these companies also are important dealers in the secondary market for the first quarter of  citigroup was in the top ten mandated arrangers of asia pacific global trade finance loans western and eastern europe global trade finance loans and americas global trade finance loans for the first quarter of   barclays was in the top ten mandated arrangers of middle east  africa global trade finance loans during the first quarter of   for the period january   through july   the top eleven dealers in assetbacked securities included bank of america merrill lynch jp morgan citigroup barclays wells fargo morgan stanley ubs and goldman sachs    these entities held  of the market share in assetbacked securities  for the period january   through june   there were sixtyone underwriters in the us high yield bond market  federated currently trades with eight of the top ten underwriters in this market jp morgan bank of america merrill lynch citigroup goldman sachs morgan stanley barclays wells fargo and ubs these entities held  of the market share for this period  the leveraged loan market contained  underwriters for the period january   through june    federated currently trades with seven of the top ten underwriters in the leveraged loan market jp morgan bank of america merrill lynch citigroup goldman sachs morgan stanley barclays and wells fargo these entities held  of the market share for this period  as of august   the money market funds held approximately  billion in floating rate interests of tobs at par value approximately  of these tobs were with the following sponsors wells fargo citi bank of america merrill lynch jp morgan and morgan stanley  at points during the past five years floating rate interests have constituted as much as  of municipal money funds’ assets additionally the intermediate and longterm municipal bond portfolios of federated use residual and inverse floater interests in tobs to increase returns and manage duration the total dollar volume of such residualinverse floater interests in tobs transactions by these funds over the last five years was approximately  of cumulative portfolio assets as of august   like the floating rate interests held by the money market funds these residual and inverse floater interests are available primarily from the largest dealers as of june   federated’s top twelve dealers included bank of america merrill lynch jp morgan goldman sachs morgan stanley barclays citigroup wells fargo and ubs for the period july   through june   over  of federated’s business was conducted with these parties  federated’s trading volume with each of these entities is as follows bank of america merrill lynch –  barclays –  jp morgan –  citigroup –  goldman sachs –  wells fargo –  morgan stanley –  ubs–  the decline in the number of brokerdealers and banks trading in the securities in which the funds seek to invest and the increasing importance of the few remaining institutions has increased the importance to the funds of their relationships with such entities preclusion from trading with a major brokerdealer in a wide variety of securities could put the funds and their advisers at a disadvantage as compared to funds not subject to such restrictions when seeking to obtain competitive pricing and achieve best execution the few other dealers available to the funds may be less inclined to provide competitive pricing or more favorable terms if such remaining dealers know that the advisers’ choices of a dealer are limited as of july   the following banks and brokerdealers each had investments in one or more of the funds bank of america merrill lynch barclays citigroup goldman sachs jp morgan morgan stanley ubs and wells fargo the percentage of outstanding voting securities held by each of these entities could rise above  of a fund’s outstanding shares at any time as of july   six of the above listed entities held more than a  ownership interest in the funds the funds and the advisers cannot prevent the percentage of voting securities controlled by these dealers and their affiliated persons from exceeding  of a fund’s outstanding shares even the dealers cannot control the percentage of shares over which they and their affiliated persons exercise control insofar as redemptions by other shareholders may increase this percentage above  thus the funds are constantly at risk of being prevented from trading with the most significant dealers in the fixed income market due to circumstances that they cannot effectively control prohibiting the funds from engaging in securities transactions with the affiliated dealers would further reduce the opportunities available to the funds to obtain competitive pricing and best execution and to access the markets for particular securities that are available from only a few dealers preventing the funds from trading with the affiliated dealers could materially limit the ability of the funds to obtain the pricing terms and quality of service available from a major dealer due to the absence of a centralized reporting mechanism for completed transactions the precise impact of not having available a bankaffiliated counterparty is difficult to measure specifically fixedincome markets are often subject to limited transparency which in turn limits an investment adviser’s ability to measure best execution on a tradebytrade basis  however it has been and is expected to be frequently the case that only a limited number of dealers have been willing to trade with a fund in a particular fixedincome security in the quantities specified by the fund at a given time as banks are now major participants in the fixedincome securities markets as described above a fund’s inability to trade with an affiliated dealer could impair the fund’s ability to trade in a particular fixedincome security at the time and in the quantities specified by the fund where the relevant affiliated dealer is one of few dealers willing to trade in such fixedincome security at such time and in such quantities the advisers to the funds seek to acquire the most suitable securities at the best prices available if a fund were precluded from participating in a primary offering of a fixedincome security because the issuer is an affiliated dealer or an affiliated dealer serves as the sole underwriter then the fund would have to acquire the security in the secondary market generally the price of a fixed income security in the secondary market will be higher than the initial offering price the more successful the primary offering the higher the aftermarket price that a fund must pay in addition a fund precluded from trading with affiliated dealers in the secondary market will be required to trade at the best price offered by an unaffiliated dealer for certain types of securities it is not uncommon for the next best price to be a full percentage point higher than the best bid or offer thus if the funds are precluded from engaging in transactions with one or more dealers in fixedincome securities this could adversely impact the advisers’ ability to obtain best execution for the funds finally the rapid pace of consolidation in the financial services industry over the past two years portends future consolidation which could even further increase the need for the funds to trade with the affiliated dealers as affiliated dealers could be among the few remaining major financial institutions which provide competitive pricing and highquality service for the relevant transactions v the securities transactions a   the securities transactions generally the funds have a variety of investment objectives but each may to a greater or lesser degree invest a portion of its assets in fixedincome securities the secondary market for fixedincome securities is typically a dealer market in which trades are effected on a principal basis new issues of fixedincome securities are typically offered in underwritten or private placement transactions the funds engage extensively in transactions involving fixedincome securities and are expected in the future if the order is granted to engage extensively in transactions that may involve an affiliated dealer these securities transactions include the following i the purchase of fixedincome securities by a fund in underwritten offerings in which an affiliated dealer may be the manager or member of the underwriting syndicate and where a fund purchases underwritten fixedincome securities from the affiliated dealer ii the purchase by a fund of fixedincome securities from or the sale of fixedincome securities to an affiliated dealer in transactions in which the affiliated dealer is acting as a principal and iii participation in certain specific arrangements or transactions involving fixedincome securities that the funds presently participate in or may participate in with an affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons these arrangements and transactions as described in section vb below are tender option bond trust structures “tobs” certain assetbacked or mortgagebacked securitization structures and loan syndicates if an affiliated dealer were considered to be an affiliated person or secondtier affiliate of the funds a securities transaction would potentially violate one or more of section a or section d of the act and rule d thereunder the inability of the funds to execute securities transactions involving an affiliated dealer may impose a hardship on the funds by prohibiting the funds from engaging in securities transactions with a broker dealer with which such funds had engaged in transactions in fixedincome securities prior to there being any affiliation between the funds and the affiliated dealer and by preventing the funds from purchasing or selling securities that the funds would have purchased or sold prior to that affiliation in transactions in which the affiliated dealer has some involvement b   joint transactions applicants are requesting an order pursuant to rule d under the act to the extent necessary to permit an affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons to participate jointly with the funds in i tobs transactions involving municipal bonds ii assetbacked or mortgagebacked securities transactions and iii syndicated loan transactions i   tender option bond trust structures certain of the funds investing in longterm municipal bonds may engage andor has in the past engaged in transactions involving tender option bond trusts “tobs” tobs are derivative securities that as relevant here are created by a fund placing municipal bonds into a trust arrangement established by a dealer on behalf of the fund in exchange each respective fund receives cash and a residual interest security in a typical tobs transaction the trust funds the purchases of the municipal bonds by issuing securities “floaters” which are purchased by thirdparty investors often taxexempt money market funds and which pay interest generally quarterly or semiannually based on interest rates that are typically reset weekly the floaters are remarketed typically on a weekly basis by a remarketing agent which receives a fee from the trust for such service during that activity the remarketing agent may also own floaters for a brief period of time while the fund holds the residual interest in addition the remarketing agent or a separate entity which may or may not be affiliated with the remarketing agent also serves as the liquidity provider by committing to hold a floater the remarketing agent is unable to place with an investor until such time as the floater can be placed or the trust is collapsed and the municipal bond is delivered back into the fund or otherwise sold events which can be triggered by the liquidity provider under certain circumstances  where floaters are tendered back to the liquidity provider the liquidity provider would hold the floaters at the same time the fund held the residual interest in the underlying bond if an affiliated dealer establishes the trust to which a fund wishes to sell its longterm security and serves as remarketing agent andor liquidity provider or an affiliated person of the affiliated dealer serves as trustee or administrator and the fund holds the residual interest in the underlying bond such a transaction could be considered a joint transaction and therefore subject to section d and rule d thereunder situations could also arise in which an affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof establishes a tobs structure for itself or a related party and holds the residual and a fund eg a taxexempt money market fund holds the floater section a also may be involved where for example an affiliated dealer as liquidity provider is to purchase a floater held by such fund the above analysis would also apply to future tobs transactions involving an affiliated dealer or any affiliated person thereof and a fund ii   asset and mortgagebacked securities in a typical assetbacked securities abs or mortgagebacked securities mbs transaction a financial institution which sponsors the abs or mbs sells a pool of loans which may have been originated by the sponsor or its affiliated persons to a special purpose entity which in turn sells such loans to a trust the trust issues interestbearing notes or passthrough certificates of which the sponsor or its affiliate may serve as underwriter backed by the trust’s assets the sponsor or its affiliate may retain an equity or residual interest in the trust the assets continue to be serviced and the income received from such assets is used to make distributions to the holders of the abs or mbs and the holder of the residual interest certain of the funds as consistent with their investment policies may enter into transactions involving abs or mbs including those that are issued by special purpose entities sponsored by affiliated dealers under circumstances in which both i the residual interest in the special purpose entity is owned directly or indirectly by the affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof and ii the affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof acts as the servicer of assets though applicants do not necessarily concede that such transactions fall under section d of the act and rule d thereunder such transactions could arguably fall under those provisions due to the various roles played by the affiliated dealers and their affiliated persons  the applicants submit however that there is little opportunity or indeed economic incentive to overreach a fund when acting in those capacities nevertheless the scenario is more complicated than a straightforward purchase or sale of a thirdparty sponsored abs or mbs from the affiliated dealers thus to the extent an independent check may be necessary for abs or mbs transactions in which i the residual interest in the special purpose entity sponsored by an affiliated dealer is owned directly or indirectly by such affiliated dealer or affiliated person and ii the relevant affiliated dealer or affiliated person thereof acts as the servicer of assets purchases of such securities will be made by a fund only where based on relevant information that is reasonably available to the fund’s adviser the adviser believes that upon the close of the transaction funds and other discretionary advisory accounts managed by the adviser will purchase less than  of the dollar amount of securities of each class acquired by the fund in the aggregate and the fund participates in each such class on the same terms as other purchasers of that class iii   syndicated loan facilities a fund may also participate as a member of a syndicated loan facility ie as a lender to the borrower under the facility in which an affiliated dealer or affiliated person thereof is also i an agent with responsibility either solely or with one or more coagents for structuring arranging placing or administering the loan facility or for other functions related to the loan syndicate ii a syndicate member or iii both as such an agent an affiliated dealer may among other things negotiate with the fund over its initial participation in the syndicate or over its subsequent approval of a waiver or other amendments to the loan facility requested by the borrower an affiliated dealer would likely receive fees from the borrower under the loan facility for acting as an agent which the fund as a nonagent member of the loan syndicate would not receive similarly where an affiliated dealer or its affiliated person and a fund took different actions as members of a loan syndicate eg one approving a requested amendment and the other not or committed to fund different amounts of the loan they might receive different levels of fees in respect of the loan though applicants do not necessarily concede that all such syndicated loan transactions fall under section d of the act and rule d thereunder such transactions could arguably come within the scope of those provisions in light of the fact that a fund and an affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof could have an interest in the same loan facility as a condition to the requested relief for syndicated loan facilities in which a fund and an affiliated dealer or its affiliated person participate and that might otherwise be prohibited by section d of the act and rule d thereunder a the participation by the fund and the affiliated dealer or affiliated person thereof would involve no coordination between the fund and the affiliated dealer thereof beyond that of a type the affiliated dealer engages in with other unaffiliated participants in such facility b the terms of the fund’s participation in the facility to the extent within the knowledge and control of the affiliated dealer would be on a basis no less advantageous than that of other similarly situated participants ie the fund will receive the same priority security interest rate and fees as other participants in the same tranche or other portion of the loan in which the fund is a participant except to the extent such difference is related to services performed with respect to the facility or their role in the facility and c in the case of the primary syndication of a loan facility where the affiliated dealer is lead agent with primary responsibility for structuring arranging or placing such facility the fund will participate in the facility only where based on relevant information that is reasonably available to the adviser the adviser believes that upon conclusion of allocations to holders of record in the primary syndication of the facility less than  of the participations will be held by funds and other discretionary advisory accounts managed by the adviser vi relevant provisions and relief requested a   relevant provisions i   section a if an affiliated dealer acquires five percent or more of one of the funds the affiliated dealer would arguably become a firsttier affiliate of that fund and a secondtier affiliate of the other funds within the meaning of section a of the act section a of the act defines “affiliated person” of another person as   a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person   b any person  per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned by controlled or held with power to vote by such person   c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person   d any officer director partner copartner or employee of such other person   e if such person is an investment company any investment adviser thereof and… accordingly by virtue of section a if a bank for example owns controls or holds with power to vote more than five percent of the outstanding shares of any of the funds that bank would be an affiliated person of that fund  further if the banks holding company or a commonly controlled subsidiary owns controls or holds with the power to vote more than five percent of the outstanding shares of any of the funds the bank would be a secondtier affiliate of that fund virtue of section ac of the act moreover based upon interpretations of the commission any person who is an affiliated person of a registered investment company may be deemed to be a secondtier affiliate of each other registered investment company which has a common investment adviser or common directors or common officers or a combination of the foregoing accordingly a registered brokerdealer or bank deemed to be an affiliated dealer in respect of one fund by virtue of its ownership of such funds shares may be deemed to be a secondtier affiliate of all the funds the result of the operation of these provisions is to prohibit the funds from engaging in a variety of transactions with a wide range of brokerdealers and banks if they or one of their affiliated persons happen to become an affiliated dealer of one of the funds ii   section a section a of the act among other things prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from selling to or purchasing from such registered company any security or other property and from borrowing money or other property from such investment company the primary purpose of section a is to prevent a person with the power to control an investment company from essentially engaging in selfdealing to the detriment of the investment company’s shareholders  in that regard section b of the act declares that it is against the public interest and the interest of investors when investment companies are organized operated managed or their portfolio securities are selected in the interest of directors officers investment advisers depositors or other affiliated persons thereof in the interest of underwriters brokers or dealers in the interest of special classes of their security holders or in the interest of other investment companies or persons engaged in other lines of business rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies’ security holders… when the person acting on behalf of an investment company has no direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a party to a principal transaction then the abuse that section a is designed to prevent is not present the funds propose to engage in securities transactions with affiliated dealers applicants submit that no risk of selfdealing would present itself in any securities transaction as the affiliated dealers will have no influence over portfolio decisions by the advisers and the advisers would receive no unfair pecuniary advantage from engaging in the securities transactions with the affiliated dealers iii   section d section d of the act and rule d thereunder prohibit any affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any secondtier affiliate acting as principal from effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit sharing plan in which the investment company participates unless an application regarding the joint transaction has been filed with the commission and granted by order rule d provides that in passing upon an application for such an order the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other applicants section d and rule d thereunder were intended to prohibit abuses arising from conflicts of interest where rather than being on opposite sides of a transaction an investment company and its affiliated persons share “some element of combination” in a transaction  as noted above and explained further below the applicants submit that in no event will an affiliated dealer have the ability to influence the decisions of the advisers on behalf of the funds moreover participation by the funds in such transactions with an affiliated dealer would be on a basis similar to that of unaffiliated investors and affiliated dealers unless any difference is related to the differing nature of their participation in the transaction  b   authority for the order section b of the act permits any person to file an application for an order of the commission exempting a proposed transaction of the applicant from the provisions of section a such applications are to be granted by the commission if evidence establishes that    the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned    the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned    and    the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act section c of the act in relevant part authorizes the commission to exempt any person or transaction or any class or classes of transactions from any provision of the act  if and to the extent that such exemption is  necessary or appropriate in the public interest  consistent with the protection of investors and  consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provision of the act relief is being requested pursuant to section c as well as section b because among other things the order would cover certain classes of transactions rule d provides that in passing upon an application for an order of the commission permitting a proposed joint venture or joint arrangement otherwise proscribed by section d the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint venture or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other applicants c   relief requested due to their status as an affiliated person any securities transaction executed by an affiliated dealer with a fund would be subject to section a of the act where the affiliated dealer acts as a principal transaction and any joint transactions would be subject to section d of the act and rule d thereunder the inability of the funds to execute securities transactions involving an affiliated dealer would significantly limit the universe of securities brokerdealers and banks available to the funds the universe of underwritings in which the funds may participate and the level and number of securities transactions in which the funds may engage moreover the consolidation in the financial industry has resulted in an increase in the involvement of banks in the primary and secondary market for fixedincome securities and thus has increased the need for applicants to be able to engage in securities transactions with affiliated dealers therefore the inability to engage in securities transactions with affiliated dealers materially and unreasonably reduces the range of investment opportunities available to the funds  the inability to effect securities transactions with affiliated dealers unduly impairs an advisers flexibility in portfolio management and deprives the funds and their shareholders of the ability to purchase and sell otherwise proper portfolio securities in order to permit the funds to be managed as effectively as possible applicants seek relief from the provisions of sections a and an order pursuant to section d of the act and rule d thereunder applicants request an order pursuant to sections c and b of the act exempting securities transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business by a fund involving an affiliated dealer under the circumstances described herein from the provisions of sections a of the act and pursuant to rule d under section d of the act permitting the securities transactions described above vii rationale for relief applicants submit that the policies which sections a and d of the act and rule d thereunder were meant to further are not implicated here because the affiliated dealers are not in a position to cause a fund to enter into a securities transaction or otherwise influence portfolio decisions by the advisers on behalf of the funds as a result no affiliated dealer is in a position to engage in selfdealing or otherwise cause any of the relevant funds to enter into transactions that are not in the best interests of its shareholders moreover applicants submit that the circumstances under which the securities transactions would be conducted including in particular the proposed conditions for the order satisfy the statutory standards for relief the conditions are designed to assure that the terms of the individual transactions are fair from the perspective of the funds at the outset the conditions require each fund’s board including a majority of its disinterested directors or trustees as applicable to approve and the fund to implement procedures governing all securities transactions pursuant to the order pursuant to such procedures among other things the securities transactions will be subject to ongoing review by each fund’s chief compliance officer and will be reviewed by its board including a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees on a quarterly basis the fund’s adviser will provide a report to the board subject to review and approval by the fund’s chief compliance officer that will indicate that the conditions of the order have been satisfied and to the extent there have been any changes in the volume type or terms of such transactions between the relevant fund and affiliated dealer the reasons for these changes and a determination that such changes are legitimate such reasons might include for example an increase in the volume of transactions involving fixedincome securities due to interest rate changes or a change in the number of dealers in a fixedincome security or changes in the number andor type of issuers the securities of which the affiliated dealer acts as underwriter or dealer further the advisers adhere to a “best execution” standard in the case of each securities transaction the relevant adviser will make a determination that such transaction is consistent with the investment objectives of the relevant fund and in the best interests of such fund’s shareholders the conditions also require price quotes from unaffiliated sources to assure fairness of price particular types of transactions including possible joint transactions will be subject to additional controls as described in section ixb in order to ensure that such transactions are not entered into on terms disadvantageous to the funds i   the securities transactions will be reasonable and fair and will not involve the risk of overreaching the independence of the affiliated dealers from the advisers demonstrates that no risk of overreaching or selfdealing by the affiliated dealers would be present if the funds and affiliated dealers engaged in securities transactions applicants believe that a brokerdealer or bank which is affiliated with a fund solely because it or an affiliated person thereof owns holds or controls  or more of a funds outstanding shares while technically an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person within the meaning of section a of the act is unlikely to possess the power in fact to improperly influence a fund with respect to purchases or sales by the fund of securities from or to an affiliated dealer in this regard as conditions to the relief requested hereby applicants assert that no affiliated dealer will control within the meaning of section a of the act directly or indirectly the advisers or the funds or act as an investment adviser to any fund further there is not and will not be any express or implied understanding between the adviser and the affiliated dealers that the adviser will cause a fund to enter into securities transactions or give preference to an affiliated dealer in effecting such transactions between the fund and the affiliated dealer applicants believe these conditions will preclude the possibility of overreaching by an affiliated dealer any possibility of overreaching is further mitigated by the oversight which will be provided as a condition to the relief requested by the boards of directors or trustees of the funds if an adviser were to purchase securities on behalf of a fund in a transaction involving an affiliated dealer the benefits afforded the affiliated dealer by engaging in such transactions would differ from and would not be shared by the adviser that is the adviser benefits from a transaction only where such transaction is beneficial to the fund by increasing the assets under management by the adviser and therefore the adviser’s fee and by positively affecting the adviser’s performance record further personnel of the advisers will be compensated based primarily on the performance of the funds managed by them ii   the funds’ participation in joint transactions will be on a basis no less advantageous than that of unaffiliated investors the complete separation of the advisers from the affiliated dealers and the inability of the affiliated dealers to influence the advisers prevents each party in a joint transaction from obtaining an unfair advantage in addition no adviser will have an economic incentive to trade with an affiliated dealer unless it is in the best interest of a fund moreover for any joint transaction effected pursuant to the order the applicants will follow procedures described in further detail in section ix below designed to ensure the fairness of such transactions for example in a joint transaction involving abs or mbs that are newly issued by special purpose entities sponsored by an affiliated dealer respectively under circumstances in which both i the residual interest in the special purpose entity is owned directly or indirectly by the affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof and ii the affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof acts as the servicer of assets a fund will purchase such abs or mbs only where funds and other discretionary advisory accounts managed by the adviser purchase less than  of the dollar amount of securities of each class acquired by the fund and the fund participates in each such class on the same terms as other purchasers of that class such a condition will reflect the armslength nature of the terms upon which the fund will participate in addition the power of the affiliated dealer or any affiliated person thereof to collapse the trust in a transaction involving tobs would be limited to the occurrence of certain events  with respect to investments in a syndicated loan facility in which a fund and an affiliated dealer or any its affiliated persons participate in a manner that may be prohibited by section d of the act the terms of the fund’s participation will involve no coordination between the affiliated dealer and the fund beyond that of a type the affiliated dealer engages in with other unaffiliated participants in the facility with respect to participation in a syndicated loan facility the terms of the fund’s participation in the facility to the extent within the knowledge and control of the affiliated dealer will be on a basis no less advantageous than that of other similarly situated participants ie the fund will receive the same priority security interest rate and fees as other participants in the same tranche or other portion of the loan in which the fund is a participant except to the extent such difference is related to services performed with respect to the facility or their role in the facility  and in the case of the primary syndication of a loan facility where the affiliated dealer is lead agent with primary responsibility for structuring arranging or placing such facility the fund will participate in the facility only where based on relevant information that is reasonably available to the adviser the adviser believes that upon conclusion of allocations to holders of record in the primary syndication of the facility less than  of the participations will be held by funds and other discretionary advisory accounts managed by the adviser iii   the order would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the policies of the funds prohibiting the funds from engaging in securities transactions involving the affiliated dealers can harm the interests of the shareholders of the funds by preventing the adviser from investing in a way which is most beneficial to the shareholders policies which sections a and d of the act were meant to further given that the securities transactions do not involve the threat of overreaching it would be contrary to the interests of the funds’ shareholders to prohibit them the affiliated dealers typically are leading brokerdealers andor banks in transactions involving a wide variety of asset classes including the types of securities in which the funds seek to invest further consolidation in the financial services industry has led funds and their advisers to rely increasingly on a smaller number of institutions for reliable information and access to the securities markets prohibiting the securities transactions would significantly narrow the universe of securities dealers permitted to engage in transactions with the funds and potentially impair the ability to diversify and to achieve favorable terms or best price and execution resulting in potential harm to shareholders of the funds finally granting the order would further the policies of the funds permitted to engage in fixedincome securities transactions applicants believe they can best safeguard investors in the funds from any remote possibility of abuse by focusing on the inherent fairness of the securities transactions with affiliated dealers the funds will apply internal control procedures designed to carefully monitor securities transactions with affiliated dealers by placing primary responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of those transactions on the funds trustees and directors these internal control procedures will provide a means by which securities transactions would be reviewed to determine whether  the security to be purchased or sold by a fund is consistent with the investment policies and objectives of that fund and with the interests of its shareholders and is comparable to other similar securities in which the fund is authorized to invest and is currently purchasing  the terms of the transactions are reasonable and fair to the shareholders of that fund and  the compensation to be received by the affiliated dealer if any is reasonable and fair iv   the securities transactions will be consistent with the purposes of the act and the protection of investors the overall purpose of sections a is to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests and some influence over the investment decisions of a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in transactions which unfairly inure to the benefit of that party and which are detrimental to the interests of the investment company and its shareholders section d and rule d thereunder are designed to prohibit abuses and overreaching by affiliated persons arising from conflicts of interest where an investment company and its affiliated persons share “some element of combination” in a transaction the funds believe they can best serve the interests of their shareholders by investing in fixedincome securities which best suit the investment objectives of the funds regardless of whether a bank which issues or deals in those securities is an affiliated person of one of the funds the complete independence of the affiliated dealers and the funds will provide protection to investors and transactions will be conducted on essentially the same arm’slength basis as would otherwise exist without the affiliation relationship between the affiliated dealer and the funds moreover the advisers and the funds will adopt and monitor procedures designed to ensure that the terms of particular securities transactions involving the affiliated dealers are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching for example before a fund and an affiliated dealer enter into any principal transaction the adviser will obtain competitive quotations for the same securities or in the case of securities for which quotations for the same securities are not available competitive quotations for comparable securities  from  a if the security is reported in a consolidated transaction reporting system such as the financial industry regulatory authority’s trade reporting and compliance engine the last reported price for such securities or for comparable securities as reported in such reporting system or b at least two other dealers that are not affiliated persons of the affiliated dealer and that are in a position to quote favorable prices  for each such securities transaction the adviser will determine based upon the information reasonably available to the fund and the adviser and deemed relevant by it that the price available from the affiliated dealer is at least as favorable as that available from other sources in addition each fund’s board including a majority of its disinterested directorstrustees will approve and the fund will implement procedures governing all securities transactions including principal transactions between the affiliated dealers and the funds in a tobs transaction the relevant fund’s board will adopt procedures designed to assure that such transaction is in the best interests of the fund taking into consideration aspects unique to such arrangement viii precedent applicants submit that the policy considerations that supported the commission’s grant of relief from section a of the act and permitting certain transactions pursuant to section d of the act and rule d thereunder in morgan stanley investments management inc et al  morgan stanley  investment company act release nos  october   notice and  october   order are particularly relevant to applicants’ request for relief in morgan stanley  as discussed further below the commission permitted transactions similar to the securities transactions despite the existence of a secondtier affiliation relationship arising from a joint venture between the holding companies of two financial services entities with advisory and brokerdealer subsidiaries the commission required two types of conditions for the relief sought in morgan stanley  both structural and transactional presumably because it determined that the risks of selfdealing and overreaching that section  is designed to prevent were mitigated only through complete assurance that the secondtier affiliates would be operated as separate entities with separate profit centers books and records and independent compensation schemes of the relevant exemptive orders morgan stanley is the most similar in terms of the types of transactions in which applicants desire to engage the applicants in morgan stanley were able to avoid selfdealing and overreaching in large part due to the separation maintained between each entity desiring to engage in the relevant transactions and the implementation of procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest similarly as addressed above the advisers will operate entirely independent of the affiliated dealers and applicants proposed conditions will ensure ample separation prevent selfdealing and overreaching and avoid conflicts of interest in addition the affiliation between the brokerdealer entities and the advisers in morgan stanley was more integral than the affiliation between the funds and the affiliated dealers in morgan stanley the affiliation between the morgan stanley funds the morgan stanley advisers and the citigroup brokerdealer and the citigroup funds the citigroup adviser and the morgan stanley brokerdealer resulted from the joint interests of citigroup and morgan stanley in an independently operated joint venture entity in contrast the funds and the advisers have no joint interest in a business venture with any affiliated dealer nor do they have any other internal structural conflict of interest the affiliation relationships giving rise to an affiliated dealer would result solely from an affiliated dealer owning  or more of a fund thus the concerns discussed in morgan stanley regarding operating the affiliated entities as “separate independent businesses” are not present here accordingly certain of the “structural” conditions in morgan stanley serve no purpose as applied to applicants request for relief and are therefore not included in the conditions detailed in section ix below applicants also refer the commission to the order granted in american century companies inc et al  american century  investment company act release nos  march   and  march   order in american century  the commission determined that the risks of selfdealing and overreaching that section  is designed to prevent were mitigated sufficiently in transactions between certain funds and brokerdealer entities where the funds and the brokerdealer entities were secondtier affiliates solely by virtue of the interest of the parent company of the brokerdealer entities in the parent company of the funds advisers in addition to morgan stanley and american century  for reasons discussed above relating to the underlying purpose of section a and the absence of the potential for selfdealing applicants submit that the policy considerations that supported the commission’s issuances of other orders granting relief from section a apply equally here including morgan stanley investment management inc et al  investment company act release nos  jan   notice and  feb   order lehman brothers asset management llc et al  investment company act release nos  aug   notice and  aug   order jp morgan investment management inc et al  investment company act release nos  may   notice and  june   order jp morgan fleming asset management usa inc et al  investment company act release nos  may   notice and  june   order goldman sachs trust et al  investment company act release nos  jan   and  feb   order and mony life insurance company et al  investment company act release nos  october   notice and  november   order applicants note that the commission has granted relief in the above orders for transactions between both second and firsttier affiliated persons while applicants recognize that the conditions in such orders may be more strict in certain respects the affiliation between the parties was also more direct although the affiliation relationship contemplated by this order is not limited to a “secondtier affiliation as described in morgan stanley  the relationship between the funds and the affiliated dealers arises solely from the affiliated dealers’ ownership of  or more of the funds outstanding securities thus the affiliation relationship between the funds and the affiliated dealers is mild and does not give rise to an internal structural conflict of interest for reasons discussed above relating to the underlying purpose of section d and the absence of the potential for selfdealing applicants submit that the policy considerations that supported the commission’s issuances of the morgan stanley and american century orders granting relief from section d also apply here applicants represent that they will not engage in securities transactions with an affiliated dealer that controls the fund pursuant to section a of the act ix applicants’ conditions applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief with respect to the securities transactions will be subject to the following conditions a   general    no affiliated dealer will control the advisers or the funds or any principal underwriter for the funds directly or indirectly within the meaning of section a of the act    no adviser will directly or indirectly consult with any affiliated dealer concerning securities purchases or sales or the selection of a broker or dealer for any securities transaction placed or to be placed on behalf of a fund or otherwise seek to influence or otherwise permit the choice of broker or dealer for any securities transaction by a fund other than in the normal course of sales activities of the same nature that are being carried out during the same time period with respect to unaffiliated institutional clients of the affiliated dealer    the advisers and the affiliated dealers will operate as separate organizations with separate capitalization separate books and records separate officers and employees and physically separate offices    the advisers have adopted policies designed to keep information about client holdings and transactions on a confidential basis prior to any public disclosure pursuant to these policies the advisers will designate information regarding investment advisory and portfolio execution matters relating to the funds as information that may not be communicated between the affiliated dealers and the advisers prior to any public disclosure    the advisers will not adopt any compensation scheme any component of which is based on the amount of business done by the funds with the affiliated dealers except to the extent such business might affect indirectly the profits or losses of the adviser    the compliance department of the advisers will prepare guidelines for their respective personnel to make certain that securities transactions effected pursuant to the order comply with its conditions and that the advisers maintain an armslength relationship with the affiliated dealers the compliance department of the advisers will monitor periodically the activities of the advisers to make certain that the conditions to the order are met    each funds’ board shall annually determine whether the level of securities transactions executed with affiliated dealers is appropriate based upon its review of the following materials to be prepared by the advisers    a           a report of the affiliated dealers’ market share in fixed income securities for the previous twelve  months and    b           a memorandum explaining why continued reliance on the order is in the best interests of the funds such memorandum will discuss the findings of the fixed income brokerage practices committees which reviews broker performance and execution on a quarterly basis such memorandum will also include an analysis of the current securities’ markets and such other materials as the board may request in order to aid it in its review including but not limited to data showing that the exclusion of the affiliated dealers would deny the funds opportunities for investment and improved execution b   transactional with respect to each securities transaction entered into or effected pursuant to the order    each fund’s board including a majority of its disinterested directorstrustees the “necessary majority” shall approve and the fund shall implement procedures governing all securities transactions pursuant to the order and the fund’s board shall no less frequently than quarterly review all such transactions and receive and review a report of those transactions such report which will be prepared by the fund’s adviser and reviewed and approved by the fund’s chief compliance officer will indicate for each transaction that the conditions of the order have been satisfied and will include a discussion of any significant changes in the volume type or terms of transactions between the relevant fund and affiliated dealer the reasons for these changes and a determination that such changes are legitimate    for each transaction the advisers will adhere to a “best execution” standard and will consider only the interests of the funds and will not take into account the impact of a fund’s investment decision on the affiliated dealer before entering into any such transaction the adviser will determine that the transaction is consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the fund and is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders    each fund will i for so long as the order is relied upon maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place a written copy of the procedures and conditions and any modifications thereto that are described herein and ii maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any securities transaction in which the fund’s adviser knows that both an affiliated dealer and the fund directly or indirectly have an interest occurs the first two years in an easily accessible place a written record of each such transaction setting forth a description of the security purchased or sold by the fund a description of the affiliated dealers or the affiliated dealer’s affiliated person interest or role in the transaction the terms of the transaction and the information or materials upon which the determination was made that each such transaction was made in accordance with the procedures set forth above and conditions in this application    except as otherwise provided in a and b below before any secondary market principal transaction is entered into between a fund and an affiliated dealer the fund’s adviser must obtain a competitive quotation for the same securities or in the case of securities for which quotations for the same securities are not available a competitive quotation for comparable securities from at least two dealers that are not affiliated persons of the affiliated dealer or the adviser and that are in a position to quote favorable market prices for each such transaction the adviser will determine based upon the quotations and such other relevant information such as available transaction prices and any other information regarding the value of the securities as is reasonably available to the adviser that the price available from the affiliated dealer is at least as favorable as that available from other sources a   with respect to each such transaction involving repurchase agreements a fund will enter into such agreements only where the adviser has determined based upon relevant information reasonably available to the adviser that the income to be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from other sources before any repurchase agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption the fund or the adviser must obtain competitive quotations with respect to repurchase agreements comparable to the type of repurchase agreement involved from at least two dealers that are not affiliated persons of the affiliated dealer or the adviser except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required b   with respect to each such transaction involving variable rate demand notes for which dealer quotes are not ordinarily available a fund will only undertake purchases and sales where the adviser has determined based on relevant information reasonably available to the adviser that the income earned from the variable rate demand note is at least equal to that of variable rate demand notes of comparable quality that are available from other sources    with respect to securities offered in a primary market underwritten transaction a fund will undertake such purchase from the affiliated dealer  only where the adviser has determined based upon relevant information reasonably available to the adviser that the securities were purchased at a price that is no more than the price paid by each other purchaser of securities from the affiliated dealer or other members of the underwriting syndicate in that offering or in any concurrent offering of the securities and on the same terms as such other purchasers except in the case of an offering conducted under the laws of a country other than the united states for any rights to purchase that are required by law to be granted to existing securities holders of the issuer    in the case of an arrangement regarding a tender option bond trust for which an affiliated dealer and any affiliated person thereof acts as a liquidity provider or remarketing agent and owns an interest or may own an interest as a result of such capacity a   the necessary majority of the fund’s board will adopt procedures designed to assure that it is in the best interests of the fund to participate in any such arrangements such procedures will take into consideration among other things the terms of the arrangement the nature of the respective interests in the trusts that may be held by the affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons and the funds and the circumstances under which the affiliated dealer or its affiliated person may cause termination of the trust and the transfer of the underlying bonds back to the fund and b   where an affiliated dealer or any affiliated person thereof owns the residual interest and a fund owns a floating rate interest  the fund must be eligible to participate in any discretionary tender on the same basis as any similarly situated holder of floating rate interests  the fund must participate in any mandatory tender on the same basis as each similarly situated holder and  less than  of the floating rate interests must be owned by funds and other discretionary accounts managed by the fund’s adviser c   before any such arrangements are entered into pursuant to the exemption where the fund holds the residual interest the fund or the adviser must obtain competitive quotations with respect to fees charged by such institutions for acting as liquidity provider or remarketing agent from at least two institutions that are not affiliated persons of the affiliated dealer except that if quotations are unavailable from two such institutions only one other competitive quotation is required any fees paid to the affiliated dealer as liquidity provider or remarketing agent will be no greater than the lowest of such quotations unless the board finds that such difference is justified by a corresponding difference in the nature of the services provided    with respect to abs or mbs that are newly issued by special purpose entities sponsored by an affiliated dealer under circumstances in which both the following are true i the residual interest in the special purpose entity is owned directly or indirectly by the affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons and ii the affiliated dealer or an affiliated person thereof acts as the servicer of assets purchases of such securities will be made by a fund only where based on relevant information that is reasonably available to the adviser the adviser believes that upon the close of the transaction funds and other discretionary advisory accounts managed by the adviser will purchase less than  of the dollar amount of securities of each class acquired by the fund in the aggregate and the fund participates in each such class on the same terms as other purchasers of that class    with respect to a syndicated loan facility in which a fund and an affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons participate in a manner that might otherwise be prohibited by section d of the act and rule d thereunder a the participation by the fund and the affiliated dealer or any of its affiliated persons will involve no coordination between the fund and the affiliated dealer beyond that of a type the affiliated dealer engages in with other unaffiliated participants in such facility b the terms of the fund’s participation in the facility to the extent within the knowledge and control of the affiliated dealer will be on a basis no less advantageous than that of other similarly situated participants ie the fund will receive the same priority security interest rate and fees as other participants in the same tranche or other portion of the loan in which the fund is a participant except to the extent such difference is related to services performed with respect to the facility or their role in the facility and c in the case of the primary syndication of a loan facility where the affiliated dealer is lead agent with primary responsibility for structuring arranging or placing such facility the fund will participate in the facility only where based on relevant information that is reasonably available to the adviser the adviser believes that upon conclusion of allocations to holders of record in the primary syndication of the facility less than  of the participations will be held by funds and other discretionary advisory accounts managed by the adviser    prior to entering into a securities transaction with an affiliated dealer the fund’s adviser will determine that the fund needs the ability to transact with the affiliated dealer based upon a reasonable determination    a that the fund could not obtain as favorable an execution for the security transaction by trading with an unaffiliated dealer and    b that there is no similar investment opportunity suitable for and more advantageous to the fund that could be obtained from an unaffiliated dealer    to the extent that such information is available to the adviser the commission fee spread or other remuneration to be received by the affiliated dealers will be reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee spread or other remuneration received by other persons in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased and sold during a comparable period of time and such fee commission spread or other remuneration will not exceed that which is stated in section e of the act    x conclusion applicants submit that the securities transactions described in this application satisfy the standards of sections c and b and rule d there is no danger of overreaching or selfdealing by an affiliated dealer in connection with a

without any influence by the affiliated dealers finally permitting the securities transactions will be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with general purposes of the act because the ability to engage in securities transactions increases the likelihood of a fund achieving best price and execution in such transactions and results in none of the abuses that the act was designed to prevent  based upon the foregoing applicants respectfully submit that it is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes and policies underlying the act to issue an order pursuant to sections c and b of the act exempting securities transactions from the provisions of section a of the act and in the case of joint transactions permitting such
