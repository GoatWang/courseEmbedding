major european country for  off ralph l schlosstein and jane d hartley are ugly examples of how the lefts crony capitalist infrastructure works both husband and wife were in the carter administration hartley who is obamas nominee for ambassador to france went on to lucrative media and consulting gigs but her husband was the one who really monetized his experience from  to  he worked in the carter administration first as deputy to the assistant secretary of the treasury department the aforementioned mr altman where he was responsible for administering the new york city loan program and for advising the treasury secretary on municipal finance issues and later as associate director of the white house domestic policy staff where he was responsible for advising the president on urban policy

mortgage products mr schlosstein started the firms interest rate swap business and led its mortgage and savings institutions group schlosstein then went on to cofound blackrock which got a sweet deal from the bailout mr geithner has also faced scrutiny over how well taxpayers were served by his handling of another aspect of the bailout three nobid contracts the new york fed awarded to blackrock a money management firm to oversee troubled assets acquired by the bank blackrock was well known to the fed mr geithner socialized with ralph l schlosstein who founded the company and remains a large shareholder and has dined at his manhattan home mr schlosstein said that while he and mr geithner spoke frequently blackrock’s work for the fed never came up   after blockrock schlosstein became president and ceo of evercore which had handled the gm bailout and made big bucks doing it evercore partners for instance was enlisted by the government to find a buyer for gm the only “buyer” they found was the american taxpayer but despite this failing evercore after its healthy fee of  million was able to secure an additional  million for a “success fee” the ceo of evercore was able to return the favor to the administration not the taxpayers by raising  million at a gala dinner at his home for the president’s reelection campaign and now schlossteins better half gets to be the ambassador to france why not this is an administration for sale president obama on friday nominated jane d hartley the chief executive officer of an economic consulting firm to be ambassador to france once more propelling a campaign fundraiser into a prominent diplomatic position the center for responsive politics listed her as a “bundler” who raised more than  for mr obama’s reelection effort her husband ralph l schlosstein is a longtime donor to the democratic party at least her ambassadorship will probably be cheaper than the wall street and gm bailouts and unlike another obama and hillary donor who got to play euro ambassador shes not a pedophile its a small victory but with an administration this horrifyingly corrupt the american people have to set the bar really low tags crony capitalism share

game face to face with evercores ralph schlosstein  pensions  investments a whole new game face to face with evercore’s ralph schlosstein ceo is blazing a far different path with evercore partners from the trail he followed while building blackrock by douglas appell · may   ralph schlosstein was on the rebound when he joined evercore partners inc as president and ceo in may  with a mission to build that publicly listed investment banks money management business alternatives holding company highview investment group the executives first move after leaving his perch as cofounder and president of blackrock blk inc blk in early  was undercut by the markets implosion later that yearmr schlosstein ultimately decided to return the  million he had raised from investors just ahead of lehman brothers holdings confidencecrushing bankruptcy but the closure of highviews door immediately saw others open for mr schlosstein the industry veteran said he left a “phenomenal run” at blackrock where he helped oversee the acquisitions of state street research  management merrill lynch investment managers and quellos group llc in search of new challengesthe game plan for evercores money management growth bears little resemblance to blackrocks successful strategy which melded a series of hefty money management acquisitions into a “one blackrock” organization instead evercore as a holding company will take minority stakes in partner firms its first two big investments under mr schlosstein — in private equity firm trilantic capital partners and equity manager atalanta sosnoff capital llc — were announced in the first quarter doug goodman ralph schlosstein current position president and ceo of evercore partnersage employees 4evercore revenue mix for march  quarter

and international affairs at the university of pittsburghpersonal married two childreninterests improving new york citys public schools — on board of directors of new visions for public schools foundation  what does a guy who helped build blackrock do for a second act i had a phenomenal run at blackrock larry fink and i are still extremely close — theres never been a moment in the  years i was no  at blackrock that i said i wish he werent here and that i had his job so it was about another challenge i really do enjoy building businesses — entrepreneurial businesses will the environment favoring an advisory firm with a money management arm go in and out of favor heres what i think will happen in the securities and banking industry therell be  to  really big firms — financial supermarkets — with huge amounts of capital competing on the basis of that capital as well as a bunch of small investment banking boutiques and then therell be room for two or three firms in the middle one of them is there already lazard — a bigger more global version of evercore we are i believe the firm that has the best chance to be the second of those firms with a very strong money management business a very strong global advisory business and an institutional equities business to raise capital for our clients no proprietary trading — steering clear of the inevitable conflicts in having a lot of capital to invest on your own behalf while being an agent and adviser for your clients does that midtier status imply a limit on evercores growth i think theres a limit to how much advisory business you can do without a balance sheet money management is probably the one area where were not particularly constrained because were a peanut and its a massive business the challenge there is finding the right kind of businesses in evercores latest results money management remained a cost center for now its a  billion collection of earlystage businesses that i inherited all of which are doing pretty well were starting to add to that through acquisitions but we have very tough standards for what were interesting in buying — very highquality repeatable institutional investment processes people who fit well with our partnershiptype culture and were a holding company so were going to own pieces of businesses and a requirement for us is that the management of any firm we buy into including the portfolio managers own a significant piece of equity in these firms as well to ensure an alignment of interests so the two firstquarter transactions we did — atalanta sosnoff we bought 4 the other transaction we did trilantic we own a much smaller portion because i believe in private equity if an institution owns more than  to  of the top line of the business you ultimately run the risk of it being destabilized what do you and evercore bring to the table for money management affiliates first we can provide a balance sheet that helps with transitions in ownership second we have relationships that can be helpful in capitalraising for certain types of businesses third we happen to be led by an executive who has some modicum of experience in the money management business  yourself yes  look the truth is if youre selling your business outright you care a little bit less about who your partner is if you coown your business you care a lot about the culture ethics and reputation of the firm and the knowledge base of the senior executives so i think having a great brand which evercore does have and a ceo whos quite knowledgeable about the money management business and has dealt with almost any issue that these people confront in the evolution of their businesses make us a really good partner to highquality firms which will remain independent its not inconceivable that at some point two of them might conclude it makes sense for us to join together for the economies of scale but the basic premise we start with is well give you lots of help and coaching but at the end of the day were looking for you to take the lead in continuing to grow the value of the equity we own together were more in the legg mason lm affiliated managers group bny mellon asset management model than in the blackrock model which you can only do with scale we obviously dont have that were smaller if youre not scale you have to pick the holding company model you could eventually achieve scale yeah but when you enter into a partnership with a bunch of people you really cant go back to them afterward and say remember what i told you in  in  were going to merge all these things together thats not a way one builds a reputation for being a great place to partner with is your approach to building the business more strategic or opportunistic we have a very clear strategy but the execution is by definition opportunistic i get asked all the time how big is your money management business going to be we would be foolish to set any kind of goal when we can find great businesses with great people great cultures that want to affiliate with us we should try to do every one of those we can if four of them come along in one quarter we should do them if none come along for two years we should sit on the sidelines your rough preferences institutional higher valueadded products  so equities and further out from equities to whatever is the higherreturn highervolatility type of businesses distressed real estate private equity longshort equity i think those are the growth parts of the money management business i think the active equities business will become more focused on strategies designed to produce not  to  basis points of excess return but a couple of hundred points if your friend mr fink is right in saying institutional clients will increasingly opt to deal with a smaller number of big money managers capable of offering a full suite of coordinated strategies are you on the right path i dont disagree with that more large investors today are asking  “what should i do with my money” thats a growing — but still a relatively small — segment of the institutional marketplace  theres still a lot of room in the business for smaller
