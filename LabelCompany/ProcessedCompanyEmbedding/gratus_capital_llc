alternative financial process that achieves the same end the collaborative encyclopedia offers two tax efficient examples  – passing one’s assets on to one’s heirs using a grantor retained annuity trust for example is potentially more tax efficient than simply letting the heirs inherit the assets  – an exchangetraded fund etf that follows the sp  index generates fewer “taxable events” than a mutual fund that follows the same index another viewpoint financial educational portal the balance uses the term tax diversification and offers the following definition tax diversification is a financial term that refers to the allocation of investment dollars to more than one account type the balance clarifies the term further by adding “tax diversification is similar to asset location not to be confused with asset allocation which refers to spreading investment dollars among various account types the location of the investment assets and choosing the best investment types that work best in those accounts” tax efficient or tax diversification for the purposes of this post we’ll use the two terms interchangeably since they both seek the same end result to help you more effectively evaluate tax efficient strategies we asked gratus capital director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for some advice lack of tax diversification negatively impacts retirement “one of the reasons tax diversification is important for investment portfolios is due to the need to minimize paying taxes during retirement” says woods “keep in mind that if you place all of your money in taxdeferred investment vehicles such as a k or individual retirement account ira you could end up paying more in taxes as compared to if you’d placed some money in taxable accounts today” avoidable yet common mistake according to woods there are many people who only save for retirement using a traditional taxdeferred retirement account such as an ira and never accumulate savings through an additional investment brokerage account “placing all your money in taxdeferred retirement accounts imposes a builtin liability” says woods “essentially a percentage of your retirement savings must go towards paying taxes” on the flip side is someone who invests in both traditional taxdeferred retirement accounts as well as other investments through a brokerage account the investor who only saved using an ira has to pay ordinary income tax on all of their withdrawals during retirement not true for an individual who saved using both an ira and an investment brokerage account this investor has a more tax efficient retirement portfolio since he or she has saved their money in different types of investment accounts that have varying tax implications for example the investor now has the ability to withdraw  percent from their ira and the balance of what they need from a brokerage account and only pay taxes on what they withdrew from their ira detailed scenario the white coat investor provides a detailed example of two retired physicians who each draw  for the year from their financial savings vehicles one physician placed all his money in a taxdeferred ira account and the other used a mix of taxdeferred and taxed accounts ultimately the physician who used both taxdeferred and taxed accounts ends up paying less in taxes the end result of the example is one doctor pays an overall tax rate of  percent while the taxdiversified doctor pays  percent    different tax planning investment accounts to build a taxefficient investment portfolio it’s important to distinguish among the four different types of investment accounts used for tax diversification says woods these include taxeddeferred pretaxed – such as a k or b these vehicles are considered qualified investment accounts and have several benefits investopedia provides a simple explanation to help differentiate between qualified and nonqualified investment accounts why are taxdeferred accounts so popular woods isolates three key benefits “first taxdeferred accounts enable you to lower the amount of income you pay taxes on now increasing your takehome pay” says woods “second since you’re deferring taxes until you withdraw funds during retirement your investments grow taxfree during the years you’re making contributions finally most retired investors are in a lower tax bracket as compared to when they were working lowering their tax obligations when they begin withdrawing” aftertax – such as a roth ira roth k or variable annuity there are no upfront tax deductions when you contribute to these retirement accounts however you pay no taxes on withdrawals during retirement and investment growth is taxfree “as a ruleofthumb if you’re age  or younger a roth k or roth ira makes sense to the extent that you’re not in the highest tax bracket” says woods “roths generally make more sense when you have more time to invest before retiring and you’re in a lower tax bracket” taxable – such as stocks mutual funds bonds cds and money markets contributing to these taxable accounts means that you pay taxes each year on the dividends interest and realized capital gains rather than when you withdraw these funds during retirement taxadvantaged – such as municipal bonds or life insurance these financial vehicles typically include a mix of taxdeductible taxdeferred and taxfree as well as other tax benefits possible diversification strategies “there are a number of strategies you can use with your portfolio management to strive for tax efficiency” says woods “one approach is to have all your incomeproducing investments in your retirement account thereby not requiring you to pay taxes on your interest each year what’s more you can also put all your stocks in taxable accounts helping to provide a preferred lower tax rate on your dividends and longterm capital gains” in closing while saving for retirement may seem like a straightforward process complexities arise when it comes to tax liabilities “there are a myriad of variables to consider when trying to lower your tax liability both for today and during retirement” says woods “i encourage all individual investors to seek the help of both a cpa and a financial advisor” why both because a cpa is an expert in tax laws and the tax preparation process whereas a financial advisor is an expert at looking at an individual’s overall financial life the latter includes financial and estate planning as well as risk and investment management investors need both advocates to help ensure a tax efficient financial portfolio says woods woods’ number one recommendation for investors “have more than just an employersponsored retirement account” says woods “if that’s all you have then it’s likely your portfolio is not tax efficient” at

market insights do you dream of owning a ski beach or lake house well you’re not alone in fact according to leading statistics company statista roughly  million people last year said they plan to buy a second home within the next  months if a special hideaway is on your wish list then planning ahead is highly recommended in order to remain financially sound to help you make an informed purchasing decision we asked gratus capital director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for some advice this is really strong considering our disclosures  how about – to help you get started we asked gratus capital director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for his thoughts on making a detailed plan first what follows are six key considerations woods encourages you to ponder before signing on the dotted line for a second home  – estimate real  unexpected costs the very first consideration for buying a second home is to ask yourself if you can actually afford it says woods “there are many people that think they’ll buy their second home rent it and make money or make enough from rental income to substantially subsidize their bills” says woods “unfortunately a great deal of the time this doesn’t turn out to be true generally it’s because many home buyers underestimate the actual carrying costs of owning a second home above and beyond a second mortgage property taxes and insurance” these additional second home expenses may include utilities general maintenance  repairs security system mowing  lawn services house cleaning services internet  cable water  sewer trash  recycling removal seasonal maintenance for heating cooling hot tubspa fireplace gutters septic pumping pesticide spraying etc opening and closing of pool spa and irrigation system longterm maintenance for exterior painting driveway sealing roof and appliance replacements travel expenses to reach second home insurance riders eg snowmobiles pool speedboat etc flood insurance property manager hidden expenses remember to account for association fees such as condo fees says woods additionally watch out for an association’s periodic assessments examples could include a onetime  fee assigned to each condo owner for a new roof a  fee for a townmandated water system upgrade or a  assessment posthurricane damage and so forth woods also reminds us to look out for individual state property taxes since some can be significantly higher than what you’re currently used to with your primary home woods recommends that once you’ve isolated all of your variable expenses double them for the first  years of ownership if you can afford your second home after doubling all monthly variable expenses then more than likely you can actually afford it “keep in mind that at any moment you could lose your job” says woods “if this were to happen to you do you have enough buffer to continue affording your second home” bankrate® provides a simple home loan calculator that you can use to generate a quick snapshot in qualifying for your second home  – identify usage  renting personal use or both it’s important to decide if you’ll use your second home for personal leisure as a rental or both the key reason to make this determination before purchasing a second home is due to tax ramifications for example according to investopedia as long as you use the property as a second home and not a rental you can deduct mortgage interest and property taxes the same way you would for your primary home you can rent your property for  days or less each year without needing to report this as income to the irs however the financial education portal adds that when you rent out your second home for  days or more and either use it for less than  days or  percent of the number of days the home was rented it’s now considered a rental property and you must report all rental income to the irs of course you’ll be able to deduct a portion or all of your rental expenses including mortgage interest property taxes insurance premiums fees paid to property managers etc turbotax provides some detailed scenarios of renting versus personal use and the respective tax ramifications here also keep in mind that the market fluctuates a property that is easily rented today may take weeks or maybe even months to rent a few years from now “we simply don’t know what the real estate market will demand from year to year” says woods  – titling your second home if you’re renting your second home woods suggests forming a limited liability company llc for the property helping to protect your personal assets if your rental business is sued for investors owning a property outside of their resident state woods suggests that you title your second home within a revocable trust helping your loved ones avoid probate should anything happen to you  – manage borrowing requests  minimize resentment according to woods often when you purchase a second home you’ll start hearing from longlost relatives and friends asking to stay over or even borrow your second home outright therefore it’s important to plan ahead and set limits the first question to ask yourself is will i allow others to use my property if so who and for how long and how often if you do allow others to use your second home it’s important to establish rules such as no smoking or pets or no one under the age of  without an older adult “the most important thing to keep in mind is that your vacation home is yours” says woods “you’ve worked hard and have been financially responsible enabling you to purchase a second home in the first place and while it’s nice to have guests or to do a favor for someone who needs an affordable vacation alternative you do not owe anyone a place to stay nor do you need to provide an excuse as to why they’re not allowed to use your second home you’ll enjoy your hideaway more when you manage your expectations not others’” real simple provides some great examples of guiltfree strategies for saying no to various types of requests from friends and family members all of us at gratus capital especially enjoyed the first strategy “saying no for the sake of your wallet”  – estimate time  pressures the concept of buying a second home is exciting says woods yet many buyers forget to take a step back and realistically consider exactly how much time they actually have to use their second home “i’ve seen second homes work out well for families that have very young children” says woods “however when kids enter middle school their activities become more of a commitment to the point that they may be penalized if they miss a game or practice your yearold may love skiing or camping now but as he ages he may lose interest and resist the idea of driving to the mountains ask yourself if you’re prepared to manage such situations” also it’s important to ask yourself if you’ll feel pressured to use your second home every time you vacation versus taking a different vacation given that you’re paying a substantial amount of money to maintain your second home woods says that vacation home owners often feel a pressure to vacation at their second home this travel limitation can ultimately lead to resentment  – maintain formal coownership agreements with friends  family if you’re considering coowning a second home with a close friend or family member woods suggests that you have a clear agreement before signing on the dotted line “keep in mind that people’s lives change and not everyone is successful at projecting their future goals” says woods “for example someone may decide they want out of the house because they need the money to help pay for their child’s college education it’s important to discuss the nittygritty when creating your coownership agreement in fact if any member of the two parties starts to get agitated with developing an agreement this could be a sign that you may not want to get into business with this individual if you’re unable to have ongoing open and difficult conversations with your coowners then the partnership will likely fail” at a minimum woods suggests that you include the following in your agreement a list of shared expenses and distribution of expenses facilitation of repairs usage scheduling who can use the house and when including key vacation periods guests who how many and how frequently house restrictions eg no smoking no pets no adult children without parent present etc buysell agreement the latter would allow you to take out life insurance on the coowner enabling you to buy his or her share of the property in the event of their death otherwise you could end up sharing your second home with your best friend’s adult children who may not like your established rules in closing “i’m all for individuals and families purchasing a second home” says woods “i too value quality time and relaxation with my family still it’s imperative that you consider both the financial and emotional factors associated with owning a second home if you can afford it that’s terrific however do you have the patience to manage it including enforcing boundaries regarding friends wanting to use your special hideaway owning a second home even if you have the money isn’t for everyone” at gratus capital we take our clients’ lifetime goals very seriously this includes their desire to secure a second home whether it be for a personal escape or as another form of income however the purchase of a second home has both short and longterm ramifications on your financial wellbeing it’s important to weigh the purchase of a second home

 httpswwwrealsimplecomworklifeguiltfreestrategiesforsayingno rd quarter  outlook  quarterly outlook this quarter we asked gratus capital director of investments todd jones to weigh in on the current financial environment to learn more about critical market trends here’s what todd is talking about this summer with equity markets at new alltime highs where is gratus now looking for different equity allocations certainly we’re being a little more cautious with our equity investments while remaining at our targets the reason we’ve been giving more caution to this side of the portfolio is due to elevated valuations specifically equity markets are experiencing valuation levels that haven’t been seen in a number of years furthermore the number of bargains available to equity investors is among the lowest we’ve witnessed at any point in this recovery cycle it’s important to recognize this since as value investors we consider price an important factor in all of our positions when determining what investments to add to or remove from a portfolio for the past  months we’ve been focusing on developed international markets such as continental europe because we continue to see select opportunities available in these markets however this is not the case for other developed areas of the world including australia and japan in our view these areas are more risky than europe because of their proximity to china emerging market stocks and bonds have been performing well is this an area gratus is considering for portfolios we’re still considering these allocations both on the equity and fixed income sides however gratus has yet to make any investments in emerging markets this is primarily because of the substantial liquidity risks that are evident in most of these markets as an example on may   the brazilian stock market was down approximately  percent this oneday price plunge highlights the hidden risks in emerging market equities unfortunately many investors aren’t paying attention to this rapid movement on the emerging market bond side this asset class looks unattractive yields on emerging market bonds relative to us treasury bonds are nearing alltime lows since the  global financial crisis we believe this represents a negatively skewed riskreturn tradeoff technology stocks have been drawing a lot of news attention and seem to be up almost every day is this something we should be concerned with there certainly have been a number of publications correlating where technology stocks are today versus a similar high valuation situation in  when there was a tech bubble however this time around in  technology segments within the equity markets appear far less risky than in  and  there are two reasons why  – the techknowledge economy is becoming larger certainly larger than in   – technology companies are generating substantial earnings therefore given that these companies are generating farsuperior earnings as compared to  the valuations are much more believable and reasonable are there any portfolio changes gratus is making now there are a number of things that we’re doing and have been doing throughout  i’d like to highlight three  – similar to the first quarter in  we rebalanced all of our accounts this year but for different reasons last year equity markets had sold off dramatically therefore we rebalanced in order to add to our equity positions this year we rebalanced all of our accounts in order to reduce equity positions because prices have moved up substantially as compared to last year  – we are increasing cash positions where available overall we haven’t held much cash in our accounts through this recovery still we believe cash will create potential opportunities within portfolios in the near future  – we are continuing to transition some of our equity and alternative positions from passive indexes to active strategies given the deluge of money being invested in passive strategies we believe active strategies will have better potential to outperform than they have at any point in the last  years we discussed this active management approach in our june market insights investing in an era where price is irrelevant

you’re pressed for time then please consider supporting their wish list requests or planned giving efforts how much life insurance do you really need  market insights no one likes to think about the idea that there may be no tomorrow whether it be for themselves or a family member but life happens and it’s for this very reason that life insurance plays such an important role in protecting your family and financial interests the key question is how much life insurance does one person or family need while the answer varies greatly depending on your personal situation there are important considerations to evaluate in order to obtain a wellrounded answer to help you start preparing a life insurance strategy we asked gratus capital wealth advisor al meadows mba cfp® for some first steps initial life insurance planning steps “when determining whether or not you even need life insurance the first step is to ask yourself if anyone is financially dependent upon you” says meadows “if so then you need life insurance the next step is to identify your current financial needs as well as your future goals start by asking yourself what current and ongoing financial obligations need to be paid then consider your longterm goals do you want to pay for your children’s or grandchildren’s college education or a wedding or perhaps provide enough income so your spouse will no longer need to work no matter what your longterm goals are you want to purchase enough life insurance to supplement existing assets to cover what you need for today and also for your future goals” common oversight many people wait until they have children to purchase life insurance meadows says this is often a mistake “keep in mind that you may have a mortgage and credit card debt as well as vehicle and college loans” says meadows “many people can’t afford to pay these debts off without their significant other’s income if this resonates with you then you more than likely need life insurance right now whether you have children or not” estimating life insurance costs research firm valuepenguin recently took an indepth look at the average cost of life insurance across a number of different policy durations the firm determined that the largest influencing factor on life insurance prices is the health of the individual being insured in fact individuals that smoke can expect to pay up to  percent more for their life insurance policies than nonsmokers as an example for a year term policy worth  a nonsmoking yearold can expect to pay  annually however for smokers the same policy is  insurance premiums increase as you age for the same plan a yearold can expect to pay  and  respectively to find your age group valuepenguin has put together a detailed average cost of term life insurance by age chart as an added life insurance price benchmarking resource the nonprofit organization life happens® offers a detailed life insurance calculator  term life versus permanent life insurance there are two different types of life insurance  term life and permanent life the latter is also known as whole life term life insurance is good for a specific time period it could be two  or  years or any amount in between permanent life insurance is a policy that you own your entire life according to meadows  percent of individuals only need term life insurance the idea is to determine the period of time that you or your life partner would need additional income if something were to happen to either of you rarely does someone need to purchase permanent life insurance however meadows identifies two legitimate reasons for needing a permanent life insurance policy  – if you have a special needs dependent since he or she will need to be taken care of indefinitely  – if you have a large estate necessitating the need for added income to cover the cost of your estate taxes employerprovided life insurance according to meadows large employers will frequently pay the premium for the first  of the employee’s groupterm life insurance coverage as part of a fulltime employee benefits package downside potential while there generally is no downside to receiving the first  of term life insurance paid by your employer there are downsides in taking out more coverage through your employer says meadows specifically if you terminate your employment you’re now without life insurance and are that much older unnecessarily increasing the cost of acquiring another life insurance policy meadows adds that there is often a misconception when it comes to employersponsored term life insurance “most people think it’s cheaper to go through your employer” says meadows “but this isn’t always the case in fact if you’re a nonsmoking healthy individual you’re potentially paying higher premiums due to the unhealthiness of some of your coworkers” meadows encourages everyone to explore the idea of an independent policy above and beyond an employersponsored plan key man  buysell life insurance for business owners business owners face two unique challenges when it comes to life insurance says meadows  – if you’re a business owner and would suffer financially due to a “key” employee dying then this insurable interest enables you to take a life insurance policy out on the employee referred to as key man insurance you can retain the policy even if this vital employee quits  – suppose you have business partners and one passes away suddenly if you do not have enough money set aside you could end up being business partners with your deceased partner’s spouse or adult children to avoid this business owners will establish a buysell agreement whereby all business partners agree to a purchase price for their business they then take out life insurance policies on each other in the amount needed to buy out the deceased partner’s share of the business more life insurance planning considerations be mindful of hidden expenses when estimating current and future expenses be aware of the money that is not spent a common example is a spouse who remains home to care for your children if he or she dies you would need to ensure that you have enough life insurance to pay for childcare and home upkeep update beneficiaries an important step within your overall life insurance strategy is to ensure that you regularly update your policy beneficiaries says meadows he suggests that you revisit all financial and estate planning accounts with assigned beneficiaries no less than once a year and most certainly when you have significant life changes eg divorce in summary at gratus

investing in an era where price is irrelevant  market insights most investors think quality as opposed to price is the determinant of whether something is risky  but highquality assets can be risky and lowquality assets can be safe  it’s just a matter of the price paid for them – howard marks sept  it seems not a day goes by where a media outlet or publication doesn’t run a story on the death of active management whether these stories note the current tidal wave of money being dumped into lowcost index mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs or the idea that some large percentage of active managers fail to beat their benchmark it’s all the same story  even notable investing legend warren buffett in his annual letter to shareholders recommended that individuals allocate almost all their investable assets to an sp  index  everywhere you turn the drumbeat of passive investing is audible  but is it a siren’s song doesn’t it strike you as odd that humans spend countless hours getting the “best deal” on items to include toothpaste cable bills gasoline and groceries and yet do not put in equal amounts of effort to a far more critical commodity their financial assets  put another way the word “deal” as described in the prior sentence is meant to imply a recognition of price consciousness  the passive approach to investing mandates that you ignore your inner drive for price consciousness  to me this behavior seems a little strange but recent flow of funds data would suggest that many investors are in fact eschewing price consciousness in favor of simple “market exposure”…just as the equity markets touch new alltime highs as with other manias in financial markets history we think what is really going on here is momentum investing  in financial markets the phenomenon of momentum refers to the positive feedback loop that is created by prices that go up over a shortintermediateterm time frame  this upward bias in prices draws in additional investors near the midtolatter stages of the cycle as fomo fear of missing out creates a buying frenzy  investor memories can be myopic and you don’t have to look hard for examples of this activity  some would include technology stocks in the late s single family homes in the mids master limited partnerships mlps in the s and the soup du jour is exchange traded funds etfs based on indices so why is it a problem that so many investors are now price insensitive and how are we gratus accounting for this new potential risk  we touched on this topic in an update last year but i believe it’s time to revisit the issue as the answer may not seem obvious low cost ≠ low risk we’ve put this idea first as we think it is the most important concept to consider when thinking about an etf or index mutual fund  just because the vehicle is low cost etfindex mutual fund does not mean that the assets underlying the vehicle do not carry risk of overvaluation  many in the financial media will eschew this point by saying something nebulous like “in the long run” or “over a full market cycle” to indicate why your entry point is irrelevant  to us these phrases are meaningless because every investor’s time horizon is different and considerations around their financial assets are unique to some degree  so to reinforce the point just because you can buy an index that has a low management fee does not mean you aren’t paying too much for the underlying assets someone needs to do the hard work to us as we’ve mentioned in prior publications successful investing all comes down to basic probability analysis and by extension riskreward  the only way we know how to pass judgment on risk versus reward is to relate an investment to its valuation ie is this investment a good deal relative to how good a deal the investment was at various points in the past or to its future prospects  there are many ways to gauge value but for simplicity’s sake we will use the pricetoearnings pe ratio  simply stated the pe ratio relates the share price of a company to the earnings it generates  the higher the pe ratio the worse of a value it becomes and the lower the probability becomes that the subject company shares can perform in line with historical norms  this is a gross simplification of all the variables that go into the pe and a rigorous company valuation but the concept helps underscore a point  the only investors that undertake company valuation analysis are active investors…not passive index or smart beta investors  therefore if fewer and fewer investors are willing to undertake valuation assessments then who is judging whether a company is overpriced or not  clearly it’s not the indexetf contingent   ease of trading ≠ better investment outcomes just because you can trade an etf buy or sell intraday whenever you feel like it doesn’t mean that this liquidity is a good attribute  in fact gratus and others like credit suisse global strategist michael mauboussin would argue that the more liquid an investment the more likely it is that an investor will trade that investment  this is partly due to loss aversion whereby losses that an investor experiences whether realized or unrealized feel three times worse than gains of an equal amount  behavioral psychologists daniel kahneman and amos tversky documented this concept known as prospect theory in their academic paper leaving loss aversion aside buying a low cost index etf does not guarantee a good investment outcome because the purchase of an etf implicitly involves investment decisions to include what size companies to purchase small v large where those companies should be domiciled us v international type of company to be purchased growth v value currency exposure  weighting in the portfolio overweight v underweight among others next there are instances of equity index etfs that actually trade at premiums to the companies within the index they are replicating  in this way investing in these select etfs means you are paying more than you would if you were to buy the underlying constituents  this is not supposed to happen in an etf  admittedly this doesn’t happen very often but when it does as was the case with the van eck junior gold miners it makes news as the etf marketing machines have placed considerable emphasis on minimal premiums and low cost contrast the highfrequency trading of etfs with some of the most successful investment programs and we believe that the intraday liquidity of etfs is more of a marketing tool than an actual benefit to investors  in the case of gratus we prefer to hold our equityetf positions multiple years if not decades  market structure degradation i’ve left this section for last as it may be a little less intuitive than the sections above  i won’t go into too much detail here but wanted to show a chart that may shed some light on this section  put simply we now have a dynamic where an increasing number of etfs are being created while the number of underlying stocks are declining  what new risks does this dynamic present next obtaining diversification within a portfolio of indicesetfs is now harder to obtain  take the case of exxonmobil  it’s a megacap energy stock with ample amounts of trading liquidity in its shares and an abovemarket dividend yield   due to these qualities and the way these attributes are weighted in both market capitalization as well as factorbased indices exxonmobil finds its shares a top  holding in a surprising number of etfs to include ishares core dividend growth etf ishares russell  value etf powershares buywrite etf spdr msci usa quality mix etf goldman sachs active beta us large cap equity etf john hancock multifactor large cap etf spdr sp  momentum tilt etf  does exxonmobil really fit the requirements of all these types of investment vehicles  you can see the issue in trying to reduce overlap in an etf portfolio where a single stock is held in many different indices  true diversification is harder to attain which is why at gratus we are migrating our portfolios to more active approaches finally within the context of market structure degradation we will spend a little time on factorbased approaches to etfindex construction  in the media factorbased approaches are commonly referred to as “smart beta”  while the concept of smart beta is a valid approach to index construction whereby stocks are selected not just by size but also other factors to include dividend yield volatility valuation momentum the problem lies with the mass adoption of the concept  i would note that most major investment firms to include behemoths like dimensional fund advisors dfa now have smart beta index etfs as a product offering  observing this buildup in enthusiasm our thoughts turn to the risks if we all agree that equities are trading at elevated valuation levels generally then what good does weighing by slightly lower pe or slightly higher dividend yield provide…… if everything is overvalued  this is where an active manager’s decision on what constitutes absolute value from the smart beta relative value becomes important  this distinction can be seen very clearly in periods approaching major turning points in the equity markets eg    conclusion in summary as we have outlined above there are many reasons to be wary of the passive investment revolution  so how are we addressing this potential issue in our portfolios  first by recognizing that index mutual funds and etfs have advantages and disadvantages  this is a big first step because the financial media and marketing machines like vanguard and blackrock have powerful platforms to spread their message which usually revolves around the ideas that  there is nothing to fear with index investments and  cost is the only area where an investor should focus  this of course is way too shortsighted  as even vanguard founder jack bogle would admit there are limits as to how many market participants could engage in indexing the simple fact is no one knows the exact percentage amount where passive ownership in equity indices becomes problematic  we would argue that the math of index investing indicates we are closer to this problem area than many realize  as an investment firm and not a marketing firm gratus has no preference in favor of any investment vehicle  our concern is to provide high quality investment counsel and identify the appropriate strategies to achieve specified goals and objectives with the least amount of risk  for many of the reasons listed above gratus has been migrating toward select active investments as we believe better opportunity lies ahead for active strategies with a discernable value proposition  in an era where price is seemingly becoming increasingly irrelevant we at gratus capital remain committed to the concepts of a valueoriented approach as we believe that value or price consciousness is one of the few timetested investment strategies leading

quarter  outlook  quarterly outlook each quarter we ask gratus capital’s investment experts todd jones or marc heilweil to weigh in on the current financial environment—addressing key issues you’ll want to have on your radar this spring we reached out to todd jones director of investments to learn more about critical market trends here’s what todd is talking about this spring are you concerned about current market levels being so high if not what are the reasons you are comfortable with staying invested in stocks we are eight years into the current bull market in equities and all indications point to a continued upward bias yes there are indicators that are flashing caution signs that occurred around previous equity market highs eg elevated schiller pe record margin debt record profit margins high levels of insider selling etc yet these are all known issues which are currently being discounted by the market on the positive side of the equation there is no denying that while the us economy may be slowing down a little other parts of the globe are counterbalancing this slowdown particularly europe this brings us to why we are comfortable with our global equity holdings at this point in the market cycle  the primary reason we remain fully invested is due to the fact that we’ve been transitioning a portion of our equity holdings away from us based companies to primarily europeanbased companies given their significant valuation and yield difference according to data from jp morgan the pricetoearnings ratio for the next  months on the sp  sits at x while the msci eafe is a more reasonable x  on a yield basis the sp  current dividend yield is  while the msci eafe yield is  in all we recognize that financial markets are cyclical  we just believe that there are a number of positive factors at work right now that lead us to believe that there is still a decent way to go until we reach the end of the current market cycle what are the biggest risks you see with the global stock markets right now it’s important to recognize that predicting what will be the catalyst for the next downturn with any degree of accuracy is next to impossible market turns are usually a confluence of events conspiring to sap investor confidence to a point that leads to a mass “sell” in the markets that being the case the biggest risks to global stocks within this mosaic approach appear to be twofold  a rapid change in inflation expectations which causes bond yields to rise quickly and  a rapid rise in the us dollar the impact of either of these events would be a reduction in global liquidity a reduction in global liquidity is a difficult environment for riskseeking assets like stocks as leveraged holders of equities can be forced to liquidate their holdings to meet capital calls in other parts of their portfolios post global central banks have broadly filled the liquidity gap with assets purchases eg quantitative easing but the efficacy of such policies is starting to be called into question now that the us federal reserve has embarked on an interest ratehiking paradigm are you concerned with inflation or interest rates rising soon this is the milliondollar question as all financial assets derive their value from a riskfree rate our base case is that longterm us interest rates remain contained and will trade within a range for the foreseeable future shorter term us interest rates will likely rise at a measured rate in lock step with the increases of the federal funds rate over time the reason we believe longer term rates will remain contained is because economic growth in the us is slowing and us demographics continue to gray leading to incremental demand for bonds as we’ve pointed out in the past this “flattening” of the yield curve starts to turn problematic typically when shortterm rates move higher than longterm rates we are still a long way from this occurrence  what would be highly problematic however is if intermediatelongterm rates were to rise in a rapid manner over a short period of time look for the next edition of our quarterly newsletter this summer when it’s marc heilweil’s turn to share his

healthy and independent adults yet as parents we often scratch our heads trying to figure out how to teach our kids about money in fact some of us don’t talk with our children about money at all according to a recent t rowe price® survey  percent of parents surveyed said they never have financial conversations with their kids while  percent said they only talk to their kids about money when their kids ask them about it intuitively we know it’s important to educate our children about the financial side of life but what’s the best way to go about it to answer this question we looked to gratus capital’s director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for some answers to qualify his answers even further we focused on children aged  to  before delving into the different age groups and their respective strategies woods believes it’s important that parents come to terms with the following two concepts once you do you’ll have greater success helping your children become moneywise adults  – understand your own thoughts about money to help your children understand money woods says that you must first understand your own thoughts about money “every day as adults we make decisions that determine what we need and want” said woods “this drives our lifestyle choices including the cars we drive the jewelry and clothes we wear the house we own and all the extras that make us feel good “however living within your means and knowing what you can afford often starts with how we grew up and how our own parents helped us learn about discipline sensibility sacrifice reward and goals when it comes to money to educate your children you have to come to terms with your own thoughts and expectations regarding money only then can you teach your children how to lead financially fulfilling and responsible lives”  – understand the impact of a digitallycharged generation according to woods today’s children are part of a generation that rarely struggles to get what it wants in fact most have never had to make a major sacrifice instead many of today’s children primarily understand what makes them happy and how to get immediate gratification but why because now more than ever today’s generation of children are being highly influenced by products and services that promise to make them happy search engines are tracking your children’s behaviors and creating advertisements that match their individual search history this bombardment of highlytargeted and customized advertising enables today’s children to see the very things they want to buy repeatedly whether it’s facebook instagram snapchat or another digital channel most kids can’t escape digital advertising digital influence aside what can you as a parent do to help your children establish good habits about spending giving and saving for the future since your children’s needs wants and goals will change depending on their age woods suggests these moneywise parenting strategies for the following ages the formative years children aged  to  most children receive money for allowances birthdays holidays and odd jobs such as babysitting and mowing lawns at this time of your child’s life you should explain three financial concepts to them how much to save how much to give back how much they’re allowed to spend woods suggests that children save no less than  percent for future needs such as college buying a car or attending a concert he’s also a strong charitable giving advocate and recommends teaching children now about setting aside money for the sole purpose of giving back he recommends five to ten percent be set aside for giving the rest of the money should go toward what your child wants today – starbucks trips to the mall etc talk more to bring goals to life it’s very important to talk with your children throughout the year about their saving spending overall needs and wants as well as their longterm goals woods suggests that parents have no fewer than four comprehensive financial conversations per year with their kids and ideally  the more conversations you have the more you help by reminding your children about their goals and checking in to see if they’re on target to accomplish them spend more time together by opening a joint account starting at age  and up is a perfect time to start buying some shares of stock or open a mutual fund the key is for you and your child to establish what your child’s ongoing contribution goal will be over time as your child sees his or her savings grow this will instill the encouragement to save even more this account also becomes one of the key financial conversations you’ll have throughout the year the budgeting years children aged  financial conversations between you and your children will vary greatly at age  perhaps even starting a bit younger the focus now turns to budgeting says woods for children who go off to college woods recommends that you and your child establish a budget for both their everyday and monthly needs they’ll have fixed expenses such as food and housing however they’ll also have variable expenses including entertainment weekend traveling with friends etc a monthly amount of money allotted to your child strengthens their decisionmaking ability surrounding how to make money last many savings apps can be quite useful in helping your son or daughter to budget more responsibly pcworld has provided a nice roundup of budgeting apps for tracking savings and spending what’s more woods recommends that your child have a summer job and be solely responsible for saving no less than the money needed for the extra spending they may want throughout the school year and summer by allotting a monthly college budget and instilling upon your student that he or she is responsible for the extra spending they desire when your child graduates college they will have built a foundation for knowing how to live within an established budget watch out for credit card magnetism according to a recent experian college graduate survey report one in five of the college students surveyed gives their college an f grade on preparing them to understand how credit works what’s more of those surveyed  percent have a credit card and had the following personal experiences  percent made a late payment  percent maxed out a card  percent had a card declined and  percent missed a payment given these statistics it’s imperative that parents and their collegeage children maintain open and ongoing communication about their child’s credit card usage like most financial vehicles credit cards have their pros and cons however as with any effective financial tool it needs to be managed says woods beware the taxman when your adult child starts their first professional job it’s very important that they understand taxes and how to manage what is left over too often young adults forget to take taxes into consideration within their saving and budgeting planning woods recommends that parents encourage their adult children to pursue four positive financial habits contribute  to  percent of their newlyfound income to their company’s k or a similar retirement plan if their company doesn’t have a retirement plan which can be true for many small businesses then contribute to an individual retirement account ira make a list of monthly expenses to determine how much is available to afford rent such as mobile phone gas car payments food etc additionally there are new expenses such as auto and renter’s insurance that need to be accounted for establish a second savings or investment account in addition to a k or ira and contribute to it each month set all savings and investment contributions so that the funds are deposited automatically alleviating monthly decisionmaking around surplus income and increasing the likelihood the money is saved in closing it’s been our experience at gratus capital that parents who start educating their children about money during their formative years such as talking about the costs of operating their home including the mortgage property taxes electricity heating and so on help their children go on to be far more moneywise and successful

home news  research about us meet the team services resources insights home  news  research  market insights market insights is your financial portfolio tax efficient  market insights most financial advisors advocate maximizing employersponsored k accounts or municipal bs generally we agree however you could be missing out on tax savings if you aren’t careful before going any further let’s be clear on what we mean by tax efficient according to wikipedia a financial process is said to be tax efficient if it is taxed at a lower rate than an alternative financial process that achieves the same end the collaborative encyclopedia offers two tax efficient examples  – passing one’s assets on to one’s heirs using a grantor retained annuity trust for example is potentially more tax efficient than simply letting the heirs inherit the assets  – an exchangetraded fund etf that follows the sp  index generates fewer “taxable events” than a mutual fund that follows the same index another viewpoint financial educational portal the balance uses the term tax diversification and offers the following definition tax diversification is a financial term that refers to the allocation of investment dollars to more than one account type the balance clarifies the term further by adding “tax diversification is similar to asset location not to be confused with asset allocation which refers to spreading investment dollars among various account types the location of the investment assets and choosing the best investment types that work best in those accounts” tax efficient or tax diversification for the purposes of this post we’ll use the two terms interchangeably since they both seek the same end result to help you more effectively evaluate tax efficient strategies we asked gratus capital director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for some advice lack of tax diversification negatively impacts retirement “one of the reasons tax diversification is important for investment portfolios is due to the need to minimize paying taxes during retirement” says woods “keep in mind that if you place all of your money in taxdeferred investment vehicles such as a k or individual retirement account ira you could end up paying more in taxes as compared to if you’d placed some money in taxable accounts today” avoidable yet common mistake according to woods there are many people who only save for retirement using a traditional taxdeferred retirement account such as an ira and never accumulate savings through an additional investment brokerage account “placing all your money in taxdeferred retirement accounts imposes a builtin liability” says woods “essentially a percentage of your retirement savings must go towards paying taxes” on the flip side is someone who invests in both traditional taxdeferred retirement accounts as well as other investments through a brokerage account the investor who only saved using an ira has to pay ordinary income tax on all of their withdrawals during retirement not true for an individual who saved using both an ira and an investment brokerage account this investor has a more tax efficient retirement portfolio since he or she has saved their money in different types of investment accounts that have varying tax implications for example the investor now has the ability to withdraw  percent from their ira and the balance of what they need from a brokerage account and only pay taxes on what they withdrew from their ira detailed scenario the white coat investor provides a detailed example of two retired physicians who each draw  for the year from their financial savings vehicles one physician placed all his money in a taxdeferred ira account and the other used a mix of taxdeferred and taxed accounts ultimately the physician who used both taxdeferred and taxed accounts ends up paying less in taxes the end result of the example is one doctor pays an overall tax rate of  percent while the taxdiversified doctor pays  percent    different tax planning investment accounts to build a taxefficient investment portfolio it’s important to distinguish among the four different types of investment accounts used for tax diversification says woods these include taxeddeferred pretaxed – such as a k or b these vehicles are considered qualified investment accounts and have several benefits investopedia provides a simple explanation to help differentiate between qualified and nonqualified investment accounts why are taxdeferred accounts so popular woods isolates three key benefits “first taxdeferred accounts enable you to lower the amount of income you pay taxes on now increasing your takehome pay” says woods “second since you’re deferring taxes until you withdraw funds during retirement your investments grow taxfree during the years you’re making contributions finally most retired investors are in a lower tax bracket as compared to when they were working lowering their tax obligations when they begin withdrawing” aftertax – such as a roth ira roth k or variable annuity there are no upfront tax deductions when you contribute to these retirement accounts however you pay no taxes on withdrawals during retirement and investment growth is taxfree “as a ruleofthumb if you’re age  or younger a roth k or roth ira makes sense to the extent that you’re not in the highest tax bracket” says woods “roths generally make more sense when you have more time to invest before retiring and you’re in a lower tax bracket” taxable – such as stocks mutual funds bonds cds and money markets contributing to these taxable accounts means that you pay taxes each year on the dividends interest and realized capital gains rather than when you withdraw these funds during retirement taxadvantaged – such as municipal bonds or life insurance these financial vehicles typically include a mix of taxdeductible taxdeferred and taxfree as well as other tax benefits possible diversification strategies “there are a number of strategies you can use with your portfolio management to strive for tax efficiency” says woods “one approach is to have all your incomeproducing investments in your retirement account thereby not requiring you to pay taxes on your interest each year what’s more you can also put all your stocks in taxable accounts helping to provide a preferred lower tax rate on your dividends and longterm capital gains” in closing while saving for retirement may seem like a straightforward process complexities arise when it comes to tax liabilities “there are a myriad of variables to consider when trying to lower your tax liability both for today and during retirement” says woods “i encourage all individual investors to seek the help of both a cpa and a financial advisor” why both because a cpa is an expert in tax laws and the tax preparation process whereas a financial advisor is an expert at looking at an individual’s overall financial life the latter includes financial and estate planning as well as risk and investment management investors need both advocates to help ensure a tax efficient financial portfolio says woods woods’ number one recommendation for investors “have more than just an employersponsored retirement account” says woods “if that’s all you have then it’s likely your portfolio is not tax efficient” at gratus capital our team is made up of cpas mbas and

httpswwwwhitecoatinvestorcomtaxestaxdiversification  httpwwwinvestopediacomaskanswersasp what to consider when buying a second home  market insights do you dream of owning a ski beach or lake house well you’re not alone in fact according to leading statistics company statista roughly  million people last year said they plan to buy a second home within the next  months if a special hideaway is on your wish list then planning ahead is highly recommended in order to remain financially sound to help you make an informed purchasing decision we asked gratus capital director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for some advice this is really strong considering our disclosures  how about – to help you get started we asked gratus capital director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for his thoughts on making a detailed plan first what follows are six key considerations woods encourages you to ponder before signing on the dotted line for a second home  – estimate real  unexpected costs the very first consideration for buying a second home is to ask yourself if you can actually afford it says woods “there are many people that think they’ll buy their second home rent it and make money or make enough from rental income to substantially subsidize their bills” says woods “unfortunately a great deal of the time this doesn’t turn out to be true generally it’s because many home buyers underestimate the actual carrying costs of owning a second home above and beyond a second mortgage property taxes and insurance” these additional second home expenses may include utilities general maintenance  repairs security system mowing  lawn services house cleaning services internet  cable water  sewer trash  recycling removal seasonal maintenance for heating cooling hot tubspa fireplace gutters septic pumping pesticide spraying etc opening and closing of pool spa and irrigation system longterm maintenance for exterior painting driveway sealing roof and appliance replacements travel expenses to reach second home insurance riders eg snowmobiles pool speedboat etc flood insurance property manager hidden expenses remember to account for association fees such as condo fees says woods additionally watch out for an association’s periodic assessments examples could include a onetime  fee assigned to each condo owner for a new roof a  fee for a townmandated water system upgrade or a  assessment posthurricane damage and so forth woods also reminds us to look out for individual state property taxes since some can be significantly higher than what you’re currently used to with your primary home woods recommends that once you’ve isolated all of your variable expenses double them for the first  years of ownership if you can afford your second home after doubling all monthly variable expenses then more than likely you can actually afford it “keep in mind that at any moment you could lose your job” says woods “if this were to happen to you do you have enough buffer to continue affording your second home” bankrate® provides a simple home loan calculator that you can use to generate a quick snapshot in qualifying for your second home  – identify usage  renting personal use or both it’s important to decide if you’ll use your second home for personal leisure as a rental or both the key reason to make this determination before purchasing a second home is due to tax ramifications for example according to investopedia as long as you use the property as a second home and not a rental you can deduct mortgage interest and property taxes the same way you would for your primary home you can rent your property for  days or less each year without needing to report this as income to the irs however the financial education portal adds that when you rent out your second home for  days or more and either use it for less than  days or  percent of the number of days the home was rented it’s now considered a rental property and you must report all rental income to the irs of course you’ll be able to deduct a portion or all of your rental expenses including mortgage interest property taxes insurance premiums fees paid to property managers etc turbotax provides some detailed scenarios of renting versus personal use and the respective tax ramifications here also keep in mind that the market fluctuates a property that is easily rented today may take weeks or maybe even months to rent a few years from now “we simply don’t know what the real estate market will demand from year to year” says woods  – titling your second home if you’re renting your second home woods suggests forming a limited liability company llc for the property helping to protect your personal assets if your rental business is sued for investors owning a property outside of their resident state woods suggests that you title your second home within a revocable trust helping your loved ones avoid probate should anything happen to you  – manage borrowing requests  minimize resentment according to woods often when you purchase a second home you’ll start hearing from longlost relatives and friends asking to stay over or even borrow your second home outright therefore it’s important to plan ahead and set limits the first question to ask yourself is will i allow others to use my property if so who and for how long and how often if you do allow others to use your second home it’s important to establish rules such as no smoking or pets or no one under the age of  without an older adult “the most important thing to keep in mind is that your vacation home is yours” says woods “you’ve worked hard and have been financially responsible enabling you to purchase a second home in the first place and while it’s nice to have guests or to do a favor for someone who needs an affordable vacation alternative you do not owe anyone a place to stay nor do you need to provide an excuse as to why they’re not allowed to use your second home you’ll enjoy your hideaway more when you manage your expectations not others’” real simple provides some great examples of guiltfree strategies for saying no to various types of requests from friends and family members all of us at gratus capital especially enjoyed the first strategy “saying no for the sake of your wallet”  – estimate time  pressures the concept of buying a second home is exciting says woods yet many buyers forget to take a step back and realistically consider exactly how much time they actually have to use their second home “i’ve seen second homes work out well for families that have very young children” says woods “however when kids enter middle school their activities become more of a commitment to the point that they may be penalized if they miss a game or practice your yearold may love skiing or camping now but as he ages he may lose interest and resist the idea of driving to the mountains ask yourself if you’re prepared to manage such situations” also it’s important to ask yourself if you’ll feel pressured to use your second home every time you vacation versus taking a different vacation given that you’re paying a substantial amount of money to maintain your second home woods says that vacation home owners often feel a pressure to vacation at their second home this travel limitation can ultimately lead to resentment  – maintain formal coownership agreements with friends  family if you’re considering coowning a second home with a close friend or family member woods suggests that you have a clear agreement before signing on the dotted line “keep in mind that people’s lives change and not everyone is successful at projecting their future goals” says woods “for example someone may decide they want out of the house because they need the money to help pay for their child’s college education it’s important to discuss the nittygritty when creating your coownership agreement in fact if any member of the two parties starts to get agitated with developing an agreement this could be a sign that you may not want to get into business with this individual if you’re unable to have ongoing open and difficult conversations with your coowners then the partnership will likely fail” at a minimum woods suggests that you include the following in your agreement a list of shared expenses and distribution of expenses facilitation of repairs usage scheduling who can use the house and when including key vacation periods guests who how many and how frequently house restrictions eg no smoking no pets no adult children without parent present etc buysell agreement the latter would allow you to take out life insurance on the coowner enabling you to buy his or her share of the property in the event of their death otherwise you could end up sharing your second home with your best friend’s adult children who may not like your established rules in closing “i’m all for individuals and families purchasing a second home” says woods “i too value quality time and relaxation with my family still it’s imperative that you consider both the financial and emotional factors associated with owning a second home if you can afford it that’s terrific however do you have the patience to manage it including enforcing boundaries regarding friends wanting to use your special hideaway owning a second home even if you have the money isn’t for everyone” at gratus capital we take our clients’ lifetime goals very seriously this includes their desire to secure a second home whether it be for a personal escape or as another form of income however the purchase of a second home has both short and longterm ramifications on your financial wellbeing it’s important to weigh the purchase of a second home within your overall financial plan particularly tax and estate implications if you have questions regarding the purchasing of a second home or any other question pertaining to your overall financial health including taxes and estate planning as well as investment

 httpswwwrealsimplecomworklifeguiltfreestrategiesforsayingno how much life insurance do you really need  market insights no one likes to think about the idea that there may be no tomorrow whether it be for themselves or a family member but life happens and it’s for this very reason that life insurance plays such an important role in protecting your family and financial interests the key question is how much life insurance does one person or family need while the answer varies greatly depending on your personal situation there are important considerations to evaluate in order to obtain a wellrounded answer to help you start preparing a life insurance strategy we asked gratus capital wealth advisor al meadows mba cfp® for some first steps initial life insurance planning steps “when determining whether or not you even need life insurance the first step is to ask yourself if anyone is financially dependent upon you” says meadows “if so then you need life insurance the next step is to identify your current financial needs as well as your future goals start by asking yourself what current and ongoing financial obligations need to be paid then consider your longterm goals do you want to pay for your children’s or grandchildren’s college education or a wedding or perhaps provide enough income so your spouse will no longer need to work no matter what your longterm goals are you want to purchase enough life insurance to supplement existing assets to cover what you need for today and also for your future goals” common oversight many people wait until they have children to purchase life insurance meadows says this is often a mistake “keep in mind that you may have a mortgage and credit card debt as well as vehicle and college loans” says meadows “many people can’t afford to pay these debts off without their significant other’s income if this resonates with you then you more than likely need life insurance right now whether you have children or not” estimating life insurance costs research firm valuepenguin recently took an indepth look at the average cost of life insurance across a number of different policy durations the firm determined that the largest influencing factor on life insurance prices is the health of the individual being insured in fact individuals that smoke can expect to pay up to  percent more for their life insurance policies than nonsmokers as an example for a year term policy worth  a nonsmoking yearold can expect to pay  annually however for smokers the same policy is  insurance premiums increase as you age for the same plan a yearold can expect to pay  and  respectively to find your age group valuepenguin has put together a detailed average cost of term life insurance by age chart as an added life insurance price benchmarking resource the nonprofit organization life happens® offers a detailed life insurance calculator  term life versus permanent life insurance there are two different types of life insurance  term life and permanent life the latter is also known as whole life term life insurance is good for a specific time period it could be two  or  years or any amount in between permanent life insurance is a policy that you own your entire life according to meadows  percent of individuals only need term life insurance the idea is to determine the period of time that you or your life partner would need additional income if something were to happen to either of you rarely does someone need to purchase permanent life insurance however meadows identifies two legitimate reasons for needing a permanent life insurance policy  – if you have a special needs dependent since he or she will need to be taken care of indefinitely  – if you have a large estate necessitating the need for added income to cover the cost of your estate taxes employerprovided life insurance according to meadows large employers will frequently pay the premium for the first  of the employee’s groupterm life insurance coverage as part of a fulltime employee benefits package downside potential while there generally is no downside to receiving the first  of term life insurance paid by your employer there are downsides in taking out more coverage through your employer says meadows specifically if you terminate your employment you’re now without life insurance and are that much older unnecessarily increasing the cost of acquiring another life insurance policy meadows adds that there is often a misconception when it comes to employersponsored term life insurance “most people think it’s cheaper to go through your employer” says meadows “but this isn’t always the case in fact if you’re a nonsmoking healthy individual you’re potentially paying higher premiums due to the unhealthiness of some of your coworkers” meadows encourages everyone to explore the idea of an independent policy above and beyond an employersponsored plan key man  buysell life insurance for business owners business owners face two unique challenges when it comes to life insurance says meadows  – if you’re a business owner and would suffer financially due to a “key” employee dying then this insurable interest enables you to take a life insurance policy out on the employee referred to as key man insurance you can retain the policy even if this vital employee quits  – suppose you have business partners and one passes away suddenly if you do not have enough money set aside you could end up being business partners with your deceased partner’s spouse or adult children to avoid this business owners will establish a buysell agreement whereby all business partners agree to a purchase price for their business they then take out life insurance policies on each other in the amount needed to buy out the deceased partner’s share of the business more life insurance planning considerations be mindful of hidden expenses when estimating current and future expenses be aware of the money that is not spent a common example is a spouse who remains home to care for your children if he or she dies you would need to ensure that you have enough life insurance to pay for childcare and home upkeep update beneficiaries an important step within your overall life insurance strategy is to ensure that you regularly update your policy beneficiaries says meadows he suggests that you revisit all financial and estate planning accounts with assigned beneficiaries no less than once a year and most certainly when you have significant life changes eg divorce in summary at gratus capital we help our clients

httpswwwirsgovgovernmententitiesfederalstatelocalgovernmentsgrouptermlifeinsurance  httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinsurableinterest investing in an era where price is irrelevant  market insights most investors think quality as opposed to price is the determinant of whether something is risky  but highquality assets can be risky and lowquality assets can be safe  it’s just a matter of the price paid for them – howard marks sept  it seems not a day goes by where a media outlet or publication doesn’t run a story on the death of active management whether these stories note the current tidal wave of money being dumped into lowcost index mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs or the idea that some large percentage of active managers fail to beat their benchmark it’s all the same story  even notable investing legend warren buffett in his annual letter to shareholders recommended that individuals allocate almost all their investable assets to an sp  index  everywhere you turn the drumbeat of passive investing is audible  but is it a siren’s song doesn’t it strike you as odd that humans spend countless hours getting the “best deal” on items to include toothpaste cable bills gasoline and groceries and yet do not put in equal amounts of effort to a far more critical commodity their financial assets  put another way the word “deal” as described in the prior sentence is meant to imply a recognition of price consciousness  the passive approach to investing mandates that you ignore your inner drive for price consciousness  to me this behavior seems a little strange but recent flow of funds data would suggest that many investors are in fact eschewing price consciousness in favor of simple “market exposure”…just as the equity markets touch new alltime highs as with other manias in financial markets history we think what is really going on here is momentum investing  in financial markets the phenomenon of momentum refers to the positive feedback loop that is created by prices that go up over a shortintermediateterm time frame  this upward bias in prices draws in additional investors near the midtolatter stages of the cycle as fomo fear of missing out creates a buying frenzy  investor memories can be myopic and you don’t have to look hard for examples of this activity  some would include technology stocks in the late s single family homes in the mids master limited partnerships mlps in the s and the soup du jour is exchange traded funds etfs based on indices so why is it a problem that so many investors are now price insensitive and how are we gratus accounting for this new potential risk  we touched on this topic in an update last year but i believe it’s time to revisit the issue as the answer may not seem obvious low cost ≠ low risk we’ve put this idea first as we think it is the most important concept to consider when thinking about an etf or index mutual fund  just because the vehicle is low cost etfindex mutual fund does not mean that the assets underlying the vehicle do not carry risk of overvaluation  many in the financial media will eschew this point by saying something nebulous like “in the long run” or “over a full market cycle” to indicate why your entry point is irrelevant  to us these phrases are meaningless because every investor’s time horizon is different and considerations around their financial assets are unique to some degree  so to reinforce the point just because you can buy an index that has a low management fee does not mean you aren’t paying too much for the underlying assets someone needs to do the hard work to us as we’ve mentioned in prior publications successful investing all comes down to basic probability analysis and by extension riskreward  the only way we know how to pass judgment on risk versus reward is to relate an investment to its valuation ie is this investment a good deal relative to how good a deal the investment was at various points in the past or to its future prospects  there are many ways to gauge value but for simplicity’s sake we will use the pricetoearnings pe ratio  simply stated the pe ratio relates the share price of a company to the earnings it generates  the higher the pe ratio the worse of a value it becomes and the lower the probability becomes that the subject company shares can perform in line with historical norms  this is a gross simplification of all the variables that go into the pe and a rigorous company valuation but the concept helps underscore a point  the only investors that undertake company valuation analysis are active investors…not passive index or smart beta investors  therefore if fewer and fewer investors are willing to undertake valuation assessments then who is judging whether a company is overpriced or not  clearly it’s not the indexetf contingent   ease of trading ≠ better investment outcomes just because you can trade an etf buy or sell intraday whenever you feel like it doesn’t mean that this liquidity is a good attribute  in fact gratus and others like credit suisse global strategist michael mauboussin would argue that the more liquid an investment the more likely it is that an investor will trade that investment  this is partly due to loss aversion whereby losses that an investor experiences whether realized or unrealized feel three times worse than gains of an equal amount  behavioral psychologists daniel kahneman and amos tversky documented this concept known as prospect theory in their academic paper leaving loss aversion aside buying a low cost index etf does not guarantee a good investment outcome because the purchase of an etf implicitly involves investment decisions to include what size companies to purchase small v large where those companies should be domiciled us v international type of company to be purchased growth v value currency exposure  weighting in the portfolio overweight v underweight among others next there are instances of equity index etfs that actually trade at premiums to the companies within the index they are replicating  in this way investing in these select etfs means you are paying more than you would if you were to buy the underlying constituents  this is not supposed to happen in an etf  admittedly this doesn’t happen very often but when it does as was the case with the van eck junior gold miners it makes news as the etf marketing machines have placed considerable emphasis on minimal premiums and low cost contrast the highfrequency trading of etfs with some of the most successful investment programs and we believe that the intraday liquidity of etfs is more of a marketing tool than an actual benefit to investors  in the case of gratus we prefer to hold our equityetf positions multiple years if not decades  market structure degradation i’ve left this section for last as it may be a little less intuitive than the sections above  i won’t go into too much detail here but wanted to show a chart that may shed some light on this section  put simply we now have a dynamic where an increasing number of etfs are being created while the number of underlying stocks are declining  what new risks does this dynamic present next obtaining diversification within a portfolio of indicesetfs is now harder to obtain  take the case of exxonmobil  it’s a megacap energy stock with ample amounts of trading liquidity in its shares and an abovemarket dividend yield   due to these qualities and the way these attributes are weighted in both market capitalization as well as factorbased indices exxonmobil finds its shares a top  holding in a surprising number of etfs to include ishares core dividend growth etf ishares russell  value etf powershares buywrite etf spdr msci usa quality mix etf goldman sachs active beta us large cap equity etf john hancock multifactor large cap etf spdr sp  momentum tilt etf  does exxonmobil really fit the requirements of all these types of investment vehicles  you can see the issue in trying to reduce overlap in an etf portfolio where a single stock is held in many different indices  true diversification is harder to attain which is why at gratus we are migrating our portfolios to more active approaches finally within the context of market structure degradation we will spend a little time on factorbased approaches to etfindex construction  in the media factorbased approaches are commonly referred to as “smart beta”  while the concept of smart beta is a valid approach to index construction whereby stocks are selected not just by size but also other factors to include dividend yield volatility valuation momentum the problem lies with the mass adoption of the concept  i would note that most major investment firms to include behemoths like dimensional fund advisors dfa now have smart beta index etfs as a product offering  observing this buildup in enthusiasm our thoughts turn to the risks if we all agree that equities are trading at elevated valuation levels generally then what good does weighing by slightly lower pe or slightly higher dividend yield provide…… if everything is overvalued  this is where an active manager’s decision on what constitutes absolute value from the smart beta relative value becomes important  this distinction can be seen very clearly in periods approaching major turning points in the equity markets eg    conclusion in summary as we have outlined above there are many reasons to be wary of the passive investment revolution  so how are we addressing this potential issue in our portfolios  first by recognizing that index mutual funds and etfs have advantages and disadvantages  this is a big first step because the financial media and marketing machines like vanguard and blackrock have powerful platforms to spread their message which usually revolves around the ideas that  there is nothing to fear with index investments and  cost is the only area where an investor should focus  this of course is way too shortsighted  as even vanguard founder jack bogle would admit there are limits as to how many market participants could engage in indexing the simple fact is no one knows the exact percentage amount where passive ownership in equity indices becomes problematic  we would argue that the math of index investing indicates we are closer to this problem area than many realize  as an investment firm and not a marketing firm gratus has no preference in favor of any investment vehicle  our concern is to provide high quality investment counsel and identify the appropriate strategies to achieve specified goals and objectives with the least amount of risk  for many of the reasons listed above gratus has been migrating toward select active investments as we believe better opportunity lies ahead for active strategies with a discernable value proposition  in an era where price is seemingly becoming increasingly irrelevant we at gratus capital remain committed to the concepts of a valueoriented approach as we believe that value or price consciousness is one of the few timetested investment strategies leading to longterm success  httpwwwberkshirehathawaycomreportshtml  investment company

particular situation for advice on taxes your investments the law or any other matters that affect you or your business teaching kids ages  to  about money  market insights you worry about them and work hard every day to provide for them hoping they’ll grow up to be happy healthy and independent adults yet as parents we often scratch our heads trying to figure out how to teach our kids about money in fact some of us don’t talk with our children about money at all according to a recent t rowe price® survey  percent of parents surveyed said they never have financial conversations with their kids while  percent said they only talk to their kids about money when their kids ask them about it intuitively we know it’s important to educate our children about the financial side of life but what’s the best way to go about it to answer this question we looked to gratus capital’s director of financial planning kevin woods cfp® for some answers to qualify his answers even further we focused on children aged  to  before delving into the different age groups and their respective strategies woods believes it’s important that parents come to terms with the following two concepts once you do you’ll have greater success helping your children become moneywise adults  – understand your own thoughts about money to help your children understand money woods says that you must first understand your own thoughts about money “every day as adults we make decisions that determine what we need and want” said woods “this drives our lifestyle choices including the cars we drive the jewelry and clothes we wear the house we own and all the extras that make us feel good “however living within your means and knowing what you can afford often starts with how we grew up and how our own parents helped us learn about discipline sensibility sacrifice reward and goals when it comes to money to educate your children you have to come to terms with your own thoughts and expectations regarding money only then can you teach your children how to lead financially fulfilling and responsible lives”  – understand the impact of a digitallycharged generation according to woods today’s children are part of a generation that rarely struggles to get what it wants in fact most have never had to make a major sacrifice instead many of today’s children primarily understand what makes them happy and how to get immediate gratification but why because now more than ever today’s generation of children are being highly influenced by products and services that promise to make them happy search engines are tracking your children’s behaviors and creating advertisements that match their individual search history this bombardment of highlytargeted and customized advertising enables today’s children to see the very things they want to buy repeatedly whether it’s facebook instagram snapchat or another digital channel most kids can’t escape digital advertising digital influence aside what can you as a parent do to help your children establish good habits about spending giving and saving for the future since your children’s needs wants and goals will change depending on their age woods suggests these moneywise parenting strategies for the following ages the formative years children aged  to  most children receive money for allowances birthdays holidays and odd jobs such as babysitting and mowing lawns at this time of your child’s life you should explain three financial concepts to them how much to save how much to give back how much they’re allowed to spend woods suggests that children save no less than  percent for future needs such as college buying a car or attending a concert he’s also a strong charitable giving advocate and recommends teaching children now about setting aside money for the sole purpose of giving back he recommends five to ten percent be set aside for giving the rest of the money should go toward what your child wants today – starbucks trips to the mall etc talk more to bring goals to life it’s very important to talk with your children throughout the year about their saving spending overall needs and wants as well as their longterm goals woods suggests that parents have no fewer than four comprehensive financial conversations per year with their kids and ideally  the more conversations you have the more you help by reminding your children about their goals and checking in to see if they’re on target to accomplish them spend more time together by opening a joint account starting at age  and up is a perfect time to start buying some shares of stock or open a mutual fund the key is for you and your child to establish what your child’s ongoing contribution goal will be over time as your child sees his or her savings grow this will instill the encouragement to save even more this account also becomes one of the key financial conversations you’ll have throughout the year the budgeting years children aged  financial conversations between you and your children will vary greatly at age  perhaps even starting a bit younger the focus now turns to budgeting says woods for children who go off to college woods recommends that you and your child establish a budget for both their everyday and monthly needs they’ll have fixed expenses such as food and housing however they’ll also have variable expenses including entertainment weekend traveling with friends etc a monthly amount of money allotted to your child strengthens their decisionmaking ability surrounding how to make money last many savings apps can be quite useful in helping your son or daughter to budget more responsibly pcworld has provided a nice roundup of budgeting apps for tracking savings and spending what’s more woods recommends that your child have a summer job and be solely responsible for saving no less than the money needed for the extra spending they may want throughout the school year and summer by allotting a monthly college budget and instilling upon your student that he or she is responsible for the extra spending they desire when your child graduates college they will have built a foundation for knowing how to live within an established budget watch out for credit card magnetism according to a recent experian college graduate survey report one in five of the college students surveyed gives their college an f grade on preparing them to understand how credit works what’s more of those surveyed  percent have a credit card and had the following personal experiences  percent made a late payment  percent maxed out a card  percent had a card declined and  percent missed a payment given these statistics it’s imperative that parents and their collegeage children maintain open and ongoing communication about their child’s credit card usage like most financial vehicles credit cards have their pros and cons however as with any effective financial tool it needs to be managed says woods beware the taxman when your adult child starts their first professional job it’s very important that they understand taxes and how to manage what is left over too often young adults forget to take taxes into consideration within their saving and budgeting planning woods recommends that parents encourage their adult children to pursue four positive financial habits contribute  to  percent of their newlyfound income to their company’s k or a similar retirement plan if their company doesn’t have a retirement plan which can be true for many small businesses then contribute to an individual retirement account ira make a list of monthly expenses to determine how much is available to afford rent such as mobile phone gas car payments food etc additionally there are new expenses such as auto and renter’s insurance that need to be accounted for establish a second savings or investment account in addition to a k or ira and contribute to it each month set all savings and investment contributions so that the funds are deposited automatically alleviating monthly decisionmaking around surplus income and increasing the likelihood the money is saved in closing it’s been our experience at gratus capital that parents who start educating their children about money during their formative years such as talking about the costs of operating their home including the mortgage property taxes electricity heating and so on help their children go on to be far more moneywise and successful simply due to the open dialogue between parent and child about life’s financial responsibilities and expectations at gratus we’re financial life

the second longest since the end of world war ii only the  bull run surpasses it since  the average bull market has lasted  months everyone knows this bull market will someday end – but who wants to

analyst stovall who used to work for standard  poor’s and now works for cfra has seen bull and bear markets come and go as he recently noted to fortune epic bull markets usually end “with a bang and

celebrate the best a stock portfolio is not a retirement plan a diversified investment mix of equity and fixedincome vehicles augmented by a strong cash position is wise in any market climate those entering retirement should have realistic assessments of the annual income they can withdraw from their savings and the potential returns from their invested assets now is not the time to be greedy with the markets near historic peaks diversification still matters and it can potentially provide a degree of financial insulation when stocks fall many investors are tempted to chase the return right

thebalancecomstockmarketcrashof  march  update dallas we’ve had a problem  market insights “houston we’ve had a problem here”  – jack swigert apollo  astronaut it was april   and the apollo  mission to the moon was approaching the point at which the lunar lander was preparing for descent  all of a sudden an oxygen tank exploded which crippled the service module and effectively aborted the mission  it was only after great effort and sacrifice that the crew of apollo  was able to return the spacecraft safely back to earth  in many ways we believe that the apollo  mission is a useful metaphor for the state of the us pension system what does apollo  have to do with the pension system and why should you care  just substitute “dallas” for houston and the metaphor will translate well  for those that haven’t been watching what is happening in the city of dallas there’s reason to be interested…especially for municipal bond investors  here’s a brief summary of what has happened the  billion dallas fire and police pension dfpp fund finds itself at ground zero of the brewing pension issues on the horizon  essentially dfpp made some bad real estate investments on behalf of its pensioners in the mids to include hawaiian villas uruguayan timber and undeveloped land in arizona  these poor investments caused the pension fund to incur average annual losses of yr for the last five years as opposed to the assumed return of  to cover promised benefits  these losses created a  billion shortfall that caused moody’s and sp to downgrade the credit rating of dallas in early january sensing that the pension was in crisis many beneficiaries opted to take out lump sum distributions in lieu of the monthly payment  this snowballing of fear caused  million in lump sum distributions in just the first few weeks of  exacerbating the shortfall and causing the mayor of dallas to halt all lump sum payments  now the city of dallasdfpp are in grueling negotiations to try and figure out where to go from here this brings us back to our original questions posed above  what does apollo  have to do with the pension system and why should you care  in short we believe many investors are  overlooking large unfunded liabilities and  still relying on credit ratings and simplistic rules of thumb when making investment decisions on municipal bond offerings  i’ll hear phrases like “i don’t have to worry about xyz city because it’s a general obligation bond” or “this bond is aaa so why would i be concerned”  these are dangerous phrases to throw around  in the case of dallas texas moody’s has downgraded its general obligation go bonds from aa to a three levels in under  months due to pension concerns  at gratus we approach a municipal bond portfolio with risk as a primary consideration  to that end below are a few considerations we keep in mind when constructing a municipal bond program  financial deterioration can happen quickly rarely is it the case that a municipality or state will jump from a high quality to lowquality bond overnight  yet details are important to monitor  one detail that we find useful is the rate of return aka discount rate assumption being used by a municipal pension  according to piper jaffray  company the median rate of return assumption being made by most municipalities is   in other words the municipality is expecting the pension asset pool to earn  in perpetuity  obviously this is far too high given where interest rates currently sit  the problem however is more insidious  if the municipality lowers its return assumptions this increases the unfunded liabilities amount given that more assets are needed to generate the same return  the table below illustrates this dynamic well  discount rate      total liabilities tn      assets tn      unfunded liability tn      all this is to say when interest rates were higher there was more margin for error on investment returns  now with interest rates hovering around historically low levels there is far less margin for error  you can’t outsource your due diligence to a credit rating agency while one would think companies providing insurance to municipal bonds have learned a valuable lesson in the credit crisis we never rely on this insurance when making a municipal bond investment  certainly the quality of municipal insurers has improved since  with the entrance of behemoths such as berkshire hathaway white mountains insurance and others  yet municipal bond insurance is often a reason i hear for not doing credit analysis under the idea that if berkshire hathaway is insuring the bond then it’s as good as an obligation of berkshire  certainly this will be the case longer term but if an investor is relying on timely principal and interest payments as part of their income any disruption whether for a month or six months to a payment can be difficult to endure  most municipalities display warning signals in advance of distress as wayne gretzky once said “a good hockey player plays where the puck is  a great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be”  our thought on the current pension situation is simply to avoid investing in municipalitiesstates where the unfunded liabilities are large relative to the size of the pension and tax base  furthermore to reduce the risk of a pension disaster we can look at essential service bonds which have zero pensionbenefit obligations  an example of this would be a municipal bond whose principal and interest is derived from a utility bill or special purpose tax  good examples of municipalities that were displaying warning signals well in advance of bankruptcy were  city of detroit  city of stockton  city of vallejo  puerto rico  current municipalities flashing warning signals include the following  state of illinois city of chicago cook county marshall islands american samoa state of connecticut city of hartford state of rhode island city of providence state of new jersey among others in summary our point in publishing this article is not to scare clients into thinking that there is some action that needs to be taken it’s merely to describe the new world order in the municipal marketplace  in our opinion rules of thumb can be dangerous  as with the apollo  mission the problem is not terminal but it’s pretty close to dire for certain municipalities  unless dramatic and swift action is taken at the municipal level to rightsize pension obligations there will be identifiable losers over the medium term  bond holders and pensioners of the problem issuers  we are and have been proceeding with caution in the municipal marketplace as we see certain geographies that could have problems in the future post script  after i wrote the piece above i looked into the situation for union pension plans  as it turns out the first union pension plan declared bankruptcy ny teamster local  earlier this year  according to industry estimates a further  union plans are on

business save more money for retirement in  easy steps  market insights according to a recent survey one in three people has no retirement savings clearly if you’re not feeling confident about your retirement savings you’re not alone as financial advisors we believe that it’s never too late to begin saving for retirement the key is to get started once you get past this initial hurdle you’ll see your savings accumulate to begin first create a realistic household budget and savings plan to help you save more money for retirement follow these three steps step  – determine what amount of money you can live within per month notice that we said live within in order to effectively save more for retirement you first need to define a budget one that includes forgoing miscellaneous purchases and freeing up additional funds for your retirement savings keep in mind that most people spend and then save what’s left over the problem with this approach is that there’s typically very little left over if anything at all therefore a key budgeting step is to first determine how much you need to save each month by using a retirement calculator you can get a better understanding of how much money you need to save in order to afford retirement based upon your projected time frame goals step  – ask yourself where is my money going if your savings aren’t adding up fast enough to meet your projected retirement timeline then the next step is to ask yourself where is my money going to answer this question try using an automated tool that helps track spending for example mint is a program that pulls all your financial information into one place so you can see your entire financial picture once you have a better understanding of where and what you’re spending money on you can make proactive savings adjustments step  – make spending cuts and redirect the funds back into savings before you start cutting be sure that you’ve outlined your savings goals and projected retirement timeline by having goals underscored by reasons it’ll be easier for you to cut expenses good savers are typically individuals motivated by personal goals contemplating where to cut spending try looking here travel  vacations – do you really need to take your family to disney world this year instead how about a weekend in the city taking advantage of local tourist destinations is a nice alternative to expensive vacations – and atlanta certainly has a lot to offer home repairs – spend when it’s really small diy jobs can often spiral into costly home renovations plan ahead for major home repairs by saving in advance in the meantime focus only on the projects necessary to the function of your home décor preferences change with the season and it’s worth waiting it out until you’ve properly budgeted for major updates dining out – it’s true packing a lunch slows you down getting out the door in the morning what’s more it’s tiring coming home after a long day at work and then needing to cook dinner yet there are tremendous savings to be had if you were to simply cut back on your dining out cnn money found that you could save as much as  by skipping two restaurant meals a week over a period of  years how about limiting a night out to once or twice a week coffeestogo – those lattes sure are delicious and at  each they ought to be in fact if you enjoy one each day on your way to work  weeks out of the year that’s approximately  a year in lattes how about limiting yourself to one or two lattes per week many people believe they need a large income in order to save effectively for retirement this isn’t true the key to saving is to monitor your spending habits and automate your savings if you’re serious about wanting to save more money for retirement then

of reduced regulation would be heavily regulated sectors like energy and mining as well as the financial sector  recent share price movements in metalsminingenergy shares certainly indicate it may be easier to minedrill in more ecologically sensitive areas than previously thought  interestingly nuclear companies are performing well with the idea that no one energy source is favored over another  until recently nuclear has been discouraged due to the nuclear waste disposal issue overseas cash repatriation the idea is that us companies would be able to bring their overseas cash back to the united states at a low tax rate  this proposal is fairly straightforward and has a high likelihood of passing through congress without much obstruction  repatriation would give corporations access to muchneeded liquidity in the event they decided they wanted to pursue ma activity increase share repurchases or increase dividend payments investment impact  the investment impact of this policy would be relatively limited if we use the template of the first overseas cash repatriation that occurred in   under that template cash that came back was mostly paid out in dividends…not reinvested in the company  furthermore overseas earnings that are being converted back into us dollars could cause the us dollar to move higher which would crimp future earnings from those same overseas subsidiaries and potentially kick start the next recession  reduction in tax rates at both the individual and corporate levels  there’s still a lot of distance to close within the republican ranks as president trump and speaker ryan have publicly proposed plans that are different  both men have proposed unique plans for corporate taxes as well as individual taxes  the key is that they both believe something needs to be done  this area of tax reform has in my opinion the highest possibility of getting congressional approval investment impact  as tax reform legislation works its way through the approval process equity markets in the us will likely respond positively  goldman sachs estimates that tax reform alone could add up to  in earnings per share or roughly  to  sp  earnings  the downside i believe is that most of this benefit has been priced into equities already as exemplified by the move in small company stocks since election day repeal and replace the affordable care act aca president trump has already issued an executive order to minimize the aca’s impact at both the state and federal levels  the us house of representatives and the senate have initiated legislative proceedings to defund the aca at the same time  it looks like this repeal and replace is the highest priority for most republicans in dc right now  the problem of course is that even with  years of time to come up with a transition plan for the aca there is still no cohesive legislative solution to fill the aca’s void investment impact  it’s still too early to tell but clearly there will be segments of the healthcare complex that stand to lose if the aca is repealed without any solution hospitals pharmaceutical companies etc  outside of healthcare i don’t see much by way of immediate market impact until more details are known massive infrastructure spending bill to rebuild america again nothing is really new here as both candidates trump and clinton had infrastructure spending proposals  clinton proposed an infrastructure bank while trump proposed opening up us infrastructure to public private partnerships ppp  ppps are a unique way to raise private capital for public projects but effectively these new ppps act as new taxes on people that use those facilities  further most infrastructure spending would get pushed down to the statelocal levels  from the time a funding measure for infrastructure would be passed to seeing shovels in the ground could take as long as  years given the permitting environmental and governmental approval process invesment impact  likely very little impact in the first four years of the trump presidency  to fund the level of infrastructure being tossed around  trillion a lot of new debt would need to be issued and absorbed by the markets  the federal reserve could buy that debt directly but this may interject new risks to the financial system if the bond mark loses faith in the federal reserve  on the positive side the sheer scale of the program would likely lead to higher levels of employment which could have a positive effect on consumer sentiment thereby providing support for risk assets in summary it would appear based on our initial analysis that much of what is being proposed above as stimulus to the economy has been accounted for in current market prices  this makes intuitive sense as equity markets typically function with a  month forwardlooking discount mechanism  for example while the sp  bottomed out in march of  sp  earnings didn’t start their upward movement until augustseptember of   further most of the above has to actually occur for the equity market to maintain its current valuations  said another way don’t get pulled into the hyperbole of the hour news cycle and keep your focus on the long term authored by the above article is intended to provide generalized financial information it does not give personalized tax investment legal or other professional advice before taking any action you should always seek the assistance of a professional who knows your particular situation for advice on taxes your investments the law or any other matters that affect you or your business  reasons you need a charitable giving plan  market insights the new year is the perfect time to make a positive difference in another’s life be sure you’re making the most of your donations with the tips below who is donating according to a recent gallup poll among us adults who said they donated money in the last  months  say they’ll give the same amount to charities in the next  months while  plan to give more and  intend to give less but how many are giving with purpose and clarity we tend to think of gifting strategies in terms of tax planning but there are many other reasons to develop a charitable giving plan including identifying your priority causes responding to requests for support and making your contributions go further i have put together a list of five reasons why you should have a simple yet flexible documented charitable giving plan use these tips to help ensure that your giving goals remain on track year after year reason  – to make an ongoing positive impact in the world beyond tax deduction benefits a charitable giving plan encompasses your philanthropic goals and the positive impact you seek to make in this world it identifies whom you want to help and why by defining the latter you’ll be better able to select from a myriad of charities make the most impact with your funds by following the steps below determine whom to help when deciding whom to help consider what you’re most passionate about and what organizations have played a key role in your life perhaps you’re passionate about animals or the environment or maybe your church or college has made a profound impact on your life drawing from your personal interests and experiences will help you in prioritizing your giving goals automate your giving these days regular giving is extremely easy to do through automatic checking withdrawals on many nonprofit websites by automating your donations whether monthly or quarterly you’ll be less likely to feel the financial impact because you’re donating over a period of time rather than in a lump sum at the end of the year answer a key question to prioritize your donations ask yourself how can i best make a long term positive impact in this world by answering this one question you’ll be more likely to achieve your giving goals also consider the scale of impact you’re seeking to make are you looking to support your local community or a worldwide cause caseinpoint according to the atlanta community food bank for each  donated they’re able to provide more than  in groceries for someone in need  clearly every dollar donated makes an immediate impact on the community the food bank serves reason  – to feel satisfied  see an impact simply by defining your goals and financial contributions you’ll be better able to see the impact that you’re having on an organization you’ll also be more able to say “no” to other charities knowing that your concentrated efforts are still helping others in the long term by determining which organizations you’ll help year after year you’ll come to know them better and enjoy your involvement that much more reason  – to take advantage of employer matches many employers match their employees’ charitable donations however employer policies and other charitable giving restrictions can change therefore make sure to review your employer’s charitable matching program annually in order to maximize the positive impact of your donation many employers enable employees to donate their time and while your time doesn’t qualify for a tax deduction it does enhance the positive changes you’re seeking to make reason  – to monitor charity standards while you may have narrowed down your charitable giving to two or three organizations which we recommend it’s important to revisit a charity’s operational standards each year as part of your plan two key considerations board structure – is your charity’s board of directors still well diversified it’s important that your charity has several independent board members to ensure that its original mission is upheld donation distribution – take the time to review how a charity distributes its donations look to review annually what percentage is spent on salaries and operations versus the amount spent directly on its programs and those meant to benefit to help you make ongoing informed giving decisions refer to charity navigator a nonprofit watchdog that rates charitable organizations in regards to their financial accountability and transparency practices reason  – to ensure tax deduction legitimacy keep in mind that not all charitable donations qualify for a tax deduction in some cases organizations may lose their nonprofit c standing to confirm that your charity is in fact still in good standing and qualifies for a tax deduction begin by utilizing the internal revenue service’s select check tool finally be sure to consult with your financial advisor when preparing to make a charitable donation your advisor can help you understand the tax impact on your overall financial plan and help you navigate the various tax deduction thresholds and other restrictions at gratus capital we welcome your charitable giving questions as philanthropic advocates ourselves we support helping others to fund their philanthropic endeavors through effective and ethical investment management
