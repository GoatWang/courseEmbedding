and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the transformation of german jewry from  to  exemplified a twofold revolution on one level the end of the feudal status of jews as an autonomous community forced them to face a protracted process of political emancipation a farreaching social metamorphosis and growing racial antisemitism yet on another level their encounter with the surrounding culture resulted in their own intense cultural productivity in this groundbreaking study david sorkin argues that emancipation and encounter with german culture and society led not to assimilation but to the creation of a new jewish identity and communitya true and vibrant subculture that produced many of judaisms modern movements and fostered a pantheon of outstanding writers artists composers scientists and academics he contends that germanjewish subculture was based not as widely believed on nationalisticjewish versus germanor religiousjewish versus christiandisparities but rather on the struggle for freedom and social acceptance in german society by studying german jewrys cultural history in its social and political context as well as in the larger setting of german history this study firmly asserts that the subculture both distinguished german jewry from other european jewish communities and accounted for its members prominent role in jewish and general culture the oxford handbook of jewish studies book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this volume on jewish studies presents surveys of todays interests and directions in the humanities and social sciences it covers the main areas taught and researched as part of jewish studies in universities throughout the world especially in europe the us and israel the religious enlightenment  protestants jews and catholics from london to vienna by david jan sorkin book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide from the publisher sorkin is right to argue that enlightenment and faith went together for most participants in the enlightenment and that this is a major topic that has been relatively neglected he has written an outstanding and eminently accessible book bringing the whole question centrally to scholars attention he skillfully demonstrates that all confessions and religious traditions found themselves very much in a common predicament and sought similar solutionsjonathan israel institute for advanced study powerfully cogent sorkin seeks to show that the religious enlightenment was not a contradiction in terms but was an integral and central part of the enlightenment anyone interested in the history of the enlightenment in particular or the eighteenth century in general will want to read this book sorkin is one of the leading scholars working in the field his scholarship is as wide as it is deeptim blanning university of cambridge moses mendelssohn and the religious enlightenment by david jan sorkin book  editions published between  and  in  languages and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide moses mendelssohn  was the premier jewish thinker of his day who was recognized in the phrase from moses unto moses there was none like moses as the legitimate successor to the medieval moses maimonides at the same time mendelssohn was one of the bestknown figures of the german enlightenment earning the sobriquet the socrates of berlin because of his eminence in both spheres mendelssohn has been treated as a symbol of the modern jewish predicament the conflict between jewish tradition and secular culture moses mendelssohn and the religious enlightenment presents a new interpretation of mendelssohns work david sorkin offers a close study of mendelssohns complete writings treating the german and the often neglected hebrew writings as a single corpus by showing that mendelssohns wellknown german pronouncements on judaism and religion take on a different meaning when they are read in the context of his entire body of work sorkin argues that mendelssohns two spheres of endeavor were entirely consistent what history tells
