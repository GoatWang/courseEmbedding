reports changes in the price movement of one stock relative to the approximately  other stocks in the publication shifts in the relative positions of other stocks value line safety ranks a second investment criterion is the safety rank assigned by value line to each of the approximately  stocks this rank measures the total risk of a stock relative to the approximately  other stocks it is derived from a stocks price stability rank and from the financial strength rating of a company safety ranks are also given on a scale from  safest to  riskiest as follows rank quality stock qualities as a group  highest the safest most stable and least risky investments relative to the value line universe which accounts for about  of the market capitalization of all stocks in the us  above average are safer and less risky than most  average are of average risk and safety  below average are riskier and less safe than most  lowest are the riskiest and least safe stocks with high safety ranks are often associated with large financially sound companies these same companies also often have somewhat lessthanaverage growth prospects because their primary markets tend to be growing slowly or not at all stocks with low safety ranks are often associated with companies that are smaller andor have weakerthanaverage finances on the other hand these smaller companies sometimes have aboveaverage growth prospects because they start with a lower revenue and earnings base value lines safety rank record safety becomes particularly important in periods of stock market downswings when many investors want to try to limit their losses we believe that if you think the market is headed lower but prefer to maintain a fully invested position in stocks concentrate on stocks ranked  or  for safety also at the same time try to keep your portfolio ranked as high as possible for timeliness the penalty and reward of risk a risky stock is one which has low price stability and whose price fluctuates widely around its own longterm trend it may also be a stock of a company with a low financial strength rating one may reasonably assume that the price of a risky stock will go up more than that of a safe stock in a generally strong market yet if in the interim it went down more sharply and you had to sell at an inopportune time you could suffer a heavier penalty for having bought the highrisk stock
