hutcheson on the guildhall saintfield the rev francis hutcheson  august  –  august  was an irish philosopher born in ulster to a family of scottish presbyterians who became known as founding fathers of the scottish enlightenment hutcheson took ideas from john locke and he was an important influence on the works of several significant enlightenment thinkers including david hume and adam smith contents  early life  return to ireland  chair of moral philosophy at glasgow  other works  ethics  death  mental philosophy  aesthetics  later scholarly mention  influence in colonial america  selected other works  see also  references  sources  external links early lifeedit he is thought to have been born at drumalig in the parish of saintfield county down ireland he was the son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock who was born in ireland hutcheson was educated at killyleagh and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow where he spent six years at first in the study of philosophy classics and general literature and afterwards in the study of theology receiving his degree in  while a student he worked as tutor to the earl of kilmarnock return to irelandedit facing suspicions about his irish roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success so he left the church returning to ireland to pursue a career in academia he was induced to start a private academy in dublin where he taught for  years also studying philosophy and produced during  inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue this writing is written as two treatises the subject of the first is aesthetics concerning beauty order harmony design and the second morality concerning moral good and evil in dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants among these was the rt hon and most rev dr william king the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishops court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence hutchesons relations with the clergy of the established church especially with archbishop king and with the rt hon and most rev dr hugh boulter lord archbishop of armagh seem to have been cordial and his biographer speaking of the inclination of his friends to serve him the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotioncitation needed etc probably refers to some offers of preferment on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination in  hutcheson married his cousin mary daughter of francis wilson of longford her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of drumnacross garrinch and knockeagh in county longford they had seven children of whom only one survived also called francis while living in dublin hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design and inquiry concerning moral good and evil in  the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in  the alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in  to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter  a criticism of thomas hobbes and the observations on the fable of the bees being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus letters a periodical that appeared in dublin – nd ed  at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet probably the second son of the rt rev dr gilbert burnet lord bishop of salisbury on the true foundation of virtue or moral goodness all these letters were collected in one volume glasgow  chair of moral philosophy at glasgowedit in  hutcheson succeeded his old master gershom carmichael in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin it is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously but their authorship appears to have been well known in  he entered on the duties of his office delivering an inaugural lecture afterwards published de naturali hominum socialitate about the natural fellowship of mankind he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me suum olim alumnum in libertatem asseruisse audiveramcitation needed i was therefore moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me its one time alumnus into freedom yet the works on which hutchesons reputation rests had already been published during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith the economist and philosopher the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson’s system of moral philosophy  is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations however it was likely something other than hutchesons written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor hutcheson other worksedit in addition to the works named the following were published during hutchesons lifetime a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage  philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens lib iii glasgow  metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens glasgow  the last work was published anonymously after his death his son francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works a system of moral philosophy in three books  vols london  to this is prefixed a life of the author by dr william leechman professor of divinity in the university of glasgow the only remaining work assigned to hutcheson is a small treatise on logic glasgow  this compendium together with the compendium of metaphysics was republished at strassburg in  thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics logic and ethics his importance is however due almost entirely to his ethical writings and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue the functions assigned to the moral sense the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare ethicsedit according to hutcheson man has a variety of senses internal as well as external reflex as well as direct the general definition of a sense being any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect  he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these senses but in various parts of his works he specifies besides the five external senses commonly recognized which he hints might be added to consciousness by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind metaph syn pars i cap  the sense of beauty sometimes called specifically an internal sense a public sense or sensus communis a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery the moral sense or moral sense of beauty in actions and affections by which we perceive virtue or vice in ourselves or others a sense of honour or praise and blame which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure and their dislike condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame a sense of the ridiculous it is plain as the author confesses that there may be other perceptions distinct from all these classes and in fact there seems to be no limit to the number of senses in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these senses the moral sense plays the most important part in hutchesons ethical system it pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections approving those that are virtuous and disapproving those that are vicious his principal design he says in the preface to the two first treatises is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions and accordingly to regulate its conduct the weakness of our reason and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent and their contraries pernicious the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies he has made virtue a lovely form to excite our pursuit of it and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage as well as the assumption that the moral sense has had no growth or history but was implanted in man exactly as found among the more civilized races an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler his use of the term sense tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for as established by hume this act consists of two parts an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process we refer the action or habit to a certain class but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of apparently the same class excited in us on former occasions even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous uniform and exempt from error the former is not all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action and does not ignore it even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless hutcheson both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation has done much to favour that loose popular view of morality which ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term moral sense which it may be noticed had already been employed by shaftesbury not only as william whewell suggests in the margin but also in the text of his inquiry if invariably coupled with the term moral judgement would be open to little objection but taken alone as designating the complex process of moral approbation it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors for if each persons decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense why be at any pains to test correct or review them or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible and how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies and the observable changes in a persons own views the expression has in fact the fault of most metaphorical terms it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately he does not like butler conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson as with shaftesbury its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle but even in the use of the phrase the greatest happiness for the greatest number inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutchesons virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra proposed for the purpose of computing the morality of actions this calculus occurs in the inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutchesons other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the benevolent theory of morals hobbes had maintained that all other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy have their roots in selflove hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions but by a not unnatural recoil that it is the only source of those actions of which on reflection we approve consistently with this position actions that flow from selflove only are morally indifferent but surely by the common consent of civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry selfrespect and in general the personal virtues are regarded and rightly regarded as fitting objects of moral approbation this consideration could hardly escape any author however wedded to his own system and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system and may thus be in part an object of his own benevolence ibid a curious abuse of terms which really concedes the question at issue moreover he acknowledges that though selflove does not merit approbation neither except in its extreme forms did it merit condemnation indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of selflove is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task the vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in hutchesons professedly ethical works but in the synopsis metaphysicae he touches on it in three places briefly stating both sides of the question but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will not the liberty of willing as we will though however his leaning is clear he carefully avoids dogmatising and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise it is easy to trace the influence of hutchesons ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might probably in large measure attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume and if this be the case the name of hutcheson connects itself through hume with the names of priestley paley and bentham butlers sermons appeared in  the year after the publication of hutchesons two first essays and there are parallels between the conscience of the one writer and the moral sense of the other deathedit francis hutcheson spent time in dublin and died while on a visit to that city in  he is buried in the churchyard of saint mary’s which is also the final resting place of his cousin william bruce today saint mary’s is a public park located in what is now wolfe tone street many united irishmen would have revered the memory of francis hutcheson some of the leaders of the dublin united irishmen are remembered in the street and placenames of the city most dubliners can direct a visitor to wolfe tone street oliver bond street russell street lord edward street and emmet road ‘never to be forgotten hutcheson’ lies in what is now an unmarked grave in the dublin he loved and ‘where his best work was done’ mental philosophyedit in the sphere of mental philosophy and logic hutchesons contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy they are interesting mainly as a link between locke and the scottish school in the former subject the influence of locke is apparent throughout all the main outlines of lockes philosophy seem at first sight to be accepted as a matter of course thus in stating his theory of the moral sense hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas see for instance inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect i ad fin and sect  and compare synopsis metaphysicae pars i cap  at the same time he shows more discrimination than does locke in distinguishing between the two uses of this expression and between the legitimate and illegitimate form of the doctrine syn metaph pars i cap  all our ideas are as by locke referred to external or internal sense or in other words to sensation and reflection it is however a most important modification of lockes doctrine and connects hutchesons mental philosophy with that of reid when he states that the ideas of extension figure motion and rest are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses that the idea of self accompanies every thought and that the ideas of number duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever see essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect i art i syn metaph pars i cap  pars ii cap i hamilton on reid p  note other important points in which hutcheson follows the lead of locke are his depreciation of the importance of the socalled laws of thought his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies the position that we cannot know the inmost essences of things intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae though they excite various ideas in us and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas syn metaph pars i cap i though at the same time we are assured of the existence of an external world corresponding to these ideas hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct syn metaph pars i cap  of the correspondence or similitude between our ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves god alone can be assigned as the cause this similitude has been effected by him through a law of nature haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio sive mentis actio quaedam sive passio dicatur non alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur quam ipse deus qui certa naturae lege hoc efilcit ut notiones quae rebus praesentibus excitantur sint ipsis similes aut saltem earum habitudines si non veras quantitates depingant pars ii cap i locke does speak of god annexing certain ideas to certain motions of bodies but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by hutcheson which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of nicolas malebranche as of those of locke amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness the distinction between body and mind corpus or materia and res cogitans is more emphatically accentuated by hutcheson than by locke generally he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body though in the posthumous work on moral philosophy he expressly states that we know mind as we know body by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown bk i ch  the distinction between perception proper and sensation proper which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out see hamiltons lectures on metaphysics – lect  hamiltons edition of dugald stewarts works v  the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty severely criticized in sir w hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect xii and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke the last point can hardly fail to suggest the commonsense philosophy of reid thus in estimating hutchesons position we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to locke but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his scottish successors the short compendium of logic which is more original than such works usually are is remarkable chiefly for the large proportion of psychological matter that it contains in these parts of the book hutcheson mainly follows locke the technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over and the book is readable it may be specially noticed that he distinguishes between the mental result and its verbal expression judgmentproposition that he constantly employs the word idea and that he defines logical truth as convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis or propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis syn metaph pars i cap  thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic aestheticsedit hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics his speculations on this subject are contained in the inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design the first of the two treatises published in  he maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty harmony and proportion this is a reflex sense because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing it may be called an internal sense both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight and hearing and because in some other affairs where our external senses are not much concerned we discern a sort of beauty very like in many respects to that observed in sensible objects and accompanied with like pleasure inquiry etc sect  xi the latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions thus the analogy between beauty and virtue which was so favourite a topic with shaftesbury is prominent in the writings of hutcheson also scattered up and down the treatise there are many important and interesting observations that our limits prevent us from noticing but to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application insisting on there being a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects antecedent to all custom education or example see inquiry etc sects   hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect  ad fin hutchesons writings gave rise to much controversy to say nothing of minor opponents such as philaretus gilbert burnet already alluded to dr john balguy – prebendary of salisbury the author of two tracts on the foundation of moral goodness and dr john taylor – of norwich a minister of considerable reputation in his time author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson the essays appear to have suggested by antagonism at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butlers dissertation on the nature of virtue and richard prices treatise of moral good and evil  in this latter work the author maintains in opposition to hutcheson that actions are – in themselves right or wrong that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding we thus see that not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth the system of hutcheson or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury contributed in large measure to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics later scholarly mentionedit references to hutcheson occur in histories both of general philosophy and of moral philosophy as for instance in pt vii of adam smiths theory of moral sentiments mackintoshs progress of ethical philosophy cousin cours dhistoire de la philosophie morale du xviii siècle

unalienable rights with the collective right to resist oppressive government was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the s in  hutcheson was publicly endorsed in the annual semiofficial massachusetts election sermon as an approved writer on ethics  hutchesons short introduction to moral philosophy was used as a textbook at the college of philadelphia in the s francis alison the professor of moral philosophy at the college of philadelphia was a former student of hutcheson who closely followed hutcheson’s thought alisons students included a surprisingly large number of active wellknown patriots” including three signers of the declaration of independence who learned their patriotic principles from hutcheson and alison”  another signer of the declaration of independence john witherspoon of the college of new jersey now princeton university relied heavily on hutchesons views in his own lectures on moral philosophy john adams read hutchesons short introduction to moral philosophy shortly after graduating from harvard garry wills argued in  that the phrasing of the declaration of independence was due largely to hutchesons influence but willss work suffered a scathing

hutcheson  august  –  august  was an irish philosopher born in ulster to a family of scottish presbyterians who became known as founding fathers of the scottish enlightenment hutcheson took ideas from

links early lifeedit he is thought to have been born at drumalig in the parish of saintfield county down ireland he was the son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock who was born in ireland hutcheson was educated at killyleagh and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow where he spent six years at first in the study of philosophy classics and general literature and afterwards in the study of theology receiving his degree in  while a student he worked as tutor to the earl of kilmarnock return to irelandedit facing suspicions about his irish roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success so he left the church returning to ireland to pursue a career in academia he was induced to start a private academy in dublin where he taught for  years also studying philosophy and produced during  inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue this writing is written as two treatises the subject of the first is aesthetics concerning beauty order harmony design and the second morality concerning moral good and evil in dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants among these was the rt hon and most rev dr william king the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishops court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence hutchesons relations with the clergy of the established church especially with archbishop king and with the rt hon and most rev dr hugh boulter lord archbishop of armagh seem to have been cordial and his biographer speaking of the inclination of his friends to serve him the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotioncitation needed etc probably refers to some offers of preferment on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination in  hutcheson married his cousin mary daughter of francis wilson of longford her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of drumnacross garrinch and knockeagh in county longford they had seven children of whom only one survived also called francis while living in dublin hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design and inquiry concerning moral good and evil in  the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in  the alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in  to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter  a criticism of thomas hobbes and the observations on the fable of the bees being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus letters a periodical that appeared in dublin – nd ed  at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet probably the second son of the rt rev dr gilbert burnet lord bishop of salisbury on the true foundation of virtue or moral goodness all these letters were collected in one volume glasgow  chair of moral philosophy at glasgowedit in  hutcheson succeeded his old master gershom carmichael in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin it is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously but their authorship appears to have been well known in  he entered on the duties of his office delivering an inaugural lecture afterwards published de naturali hominum socialitate about the natural fellowship of mankind he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me suum olim alumnum in libertatem asseruisse audiveramcitation needed i was therefore moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me its one time alumnus into freedom yet the works on which hutchesons reputation rests had already been published during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith the economist and philosopher the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson’s system of moral philosophy  is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations however it was likely something other than hutchesons written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor hutcheson other worksedit in addition to the works named the following were published during hutchesons lifetime a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage  philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens lib iii glasgow  metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens glasgow  the last work was published anonymously after his death his son francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works a system of moral philosophy in three books  vols london  to this is prefixed a life of the author by dr william leechman professor of divinity in the university of glasgow the only remaining work assigned to hutcheson is a small treatise on logic glasgow  this compendium together with the compendium of metaphysics was republished at strassburg in  thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics logic and ethics his importance is however due almost entirely to his ethical writings and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue the functions assigned to the moral sense the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare ethicsedit according to hutcheson man has a variety of senses internal as well as external reflex as well as direct the general definition of a sense being any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect  he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these senses but in various parts of his works he specifies besides the five external senses commonly recognized which he hints might be added to consciousness by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind metaph syn pars i cap  the sense of beauty sometimes called specifically an internal sense a public sense or sensus communis a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery the moral sense or moral sense of beauty in actions and affections by which we perceive virtue or vice in ourselves or others a sense of honour or praise and blame which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure and their dislike condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame a sense of the ridiculous it is plain as the author confesses that there may be other perceptions distinct from all these classes and in fact there seems to be no limit to the number of senses in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these senses the moral sense plays the most important part in hutchesons ethical system it pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections approving those that are virtuous and disapproving those that are vicious his principal design he says in the preface to the two first treatises is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions and accordingly to regulate its conduct the weakness of our reason and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent and their contraries pernicious the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies he has made virtue a lovely form to excite our pursuit of it and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage as well as the assumption that the moral sense has had no growth or history but was implanted in man exactly as found among the more civilized races an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler his use of the term sense tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for as established by hume this act consists of two parts an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process we refer the action or habit to a certain class but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of apparently the same class excited in us on former occasions even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous uniform and exempt from error the former is not all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action and does not ignore it even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless hutcheson both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation has done much to favour that loose popular view of morality which ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term moral sense which it may be noticed had already been employed by shaftesbury not only as william whewell suggests in the margin but also in the text of his inquiry if invariably coupled with the term moral judgement would be open to little objection but taken alone as designating the complex process of moral approbation it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors for if each persons decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense why be at any pains to test correct or review them or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible and how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies and the observable changes in a persons own views the expression has in fact the fault of most metaphorical terms it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately he does not like butler conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson as with shaftesbury its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle but even in the use of the phrase the greatest happiness for the greatest number inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutchesons virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra proposed for the purpose of computing the morality of actions this calculus occurs in the inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutchesons other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the benevolent theory of morals hobbes had maintained that all other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy have their roots in selflove hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions but by a not unnatural recoil that it is the only source of those actions of which on reflection we approve consistently with this position actions that flow from selflove only are morally indifferent but surely by the common consent of civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry selfrespect and in general the personal virtues are regarded and rightly regarded as fitting objects of moral approbation this consideration could hardly escape any author however wedded to his own system and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system and may thus be in part an object of his own benevolence ibid a curious abuse of terms which really concedes the question at issue moreover he acknowledges that though selflove does not merit approbation neither except in its extreme forms did it merit condemnation indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of selflove is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task the vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in hutchesons professedly ethical works but in the synopsis metaphysicae he touches on it in three places briefly stating both sides of the question but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will not the liberty of willing as we will though however his leaning is clear he carefully avoids dogmatising and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise it is easy to trace the influence of hutchesons ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might probably in large measure attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume and if this be the case the

street oliver bond street russell street lord edward street and emmet road ‘never to be forgotten hutcheson’ lies in what is now an unmarked grave in the dublin he loved and ‘where his best work was done’ mental philosophyedit in the sphere of mental philosophy and logic hutchesons contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy they are interesting mainly as a link between locke and the scottish school in the former subject the influence of locke is apparent throughout all the main outlines of lockes philosophy seem at first sight to be accepted as a matter of course thus in stating his theory of the moral sense hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas see for instance inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect i ad fin and sect  and compare synopsis metaphysicae pars i cap  at the same time he shows more discrimination than does locke in distinguishing between the two uses of this expression and between the legitimate and illegitimate form of the doctrine syn metaph pars i cap  all our ideas are as by locke referred to external or internal sense or in other words to sensation and reflection it is however a most important modification of lockes doctrine and connects hutchesons mental philosophy with that of reid when he states that the ideas of extension figure motion and rest are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses that the idea of self accompanies every thought and that the ideas of number duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever see essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect i art i syn metaph pars i cap  pars ii cap i hamilton on reid p  note other important points in which hutcheson follows the lead of locke are his depreciation of the importance of the socalled laws of thought his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies the position that we cannot know the inmost essences of things intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae though they excite various ideas in us and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas syn metaph pars i cap i though at the same time we are assured of the existence of an external world corresponding to these ideas hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct syn metaph pars i cap  of the correspondence or similitude between our ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves god alone can be assigned as the cause this similitude has been effected by him through a law of nature haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio sive mentis actio quaedam sive passio dicatur non alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur quam ipse deus qui certa naturae lege hoc efilcit ut notiones quae rebus praesentibus excitantur sint ipsis similes aut saltem earum habitudines si non veras quantitates depingant pars ii cap i locke does speak of god annexing certain ideas to certain motions of bodies but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by hutcheson which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of nicolas malebranche as of those of locke amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness the distinction between body and mind corpus or materia and res cogitans is more emphatically accentuated by hutcheson than by locke generally he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body though in the posthumous work on moral philosophy he expressly states that we know mind as we know body by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown bk i ch  the distinction between perception proper and sensation proper which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out see hamiltons lectures on metaphysics – lect  hamiltons edition of dugald stewarts works v  the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty severely criticized in sir w hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect xii and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke the last point can hardly fail to suggest the commonsense philosophy of reid thus in estimating hutchesons position we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to locke but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his scottish successors the short compendium of logic which is more original than such works usually are is remarkable chiefly for the large proportion of psychological matter that it contains in these parts of the book hutcheson mainly follows locke the technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over and the book is readable it may be specially noticed that he distinguishes between the mental result and its verbal expression judgmentproposition that he constantly employs the word idea and that he defines logical truth as convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis or propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis syn metaph pars i cap  thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic aestheticsedit hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics his speculations on this subject are contained in the inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design the first of the two treatises published in  he maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty harmony and proportion this is a reflex sense because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing it may be called an internal sense both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight and hearing and because in some other affairs where our external senses are not much concerned we discern a sort of beauty very like in many respects to that observed in sensible objects and accompanied with like pleasure inquiry etc sect  xi the latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions thus the analogy between beauty and virtue which was so favourite a topic with shaftesbury is prominent in the writings of hutcheson also scattered up and down the treatise there are many important and interesting observations that our limits prevent us from noticing but to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application insisting on there being a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects antecedent to all custom education or example see inquiry etc sects   hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect  ad fin hutchesons writings gave rise to much controversy to say nothing of minor opponents such as philaretus gilbert burnet already alluded to dr john balguy – prebendary of salisbury the author of two tracts on the foundation of moral goodness and dr john taylor – of norwich a minister of considerable reputation in his time author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson the essays appear to have suggested by antagonism at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butlers dissertation on the nature of virtue and richard prices treatise of moral good and evil  in this latter work the author maintains in opposition to hutcheson that actions are – in themselves right or wrong that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding we thus see that not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth the system of hutcheson or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury contributed in large measure to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics later scholarly mentionedit references to hutcheson occur in histories both of general philosophy

unalienable rights with the collective right to resist oppressive government was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the s in  hutcheson was publicly endorsed in the annual semiofficial massachusetts election sermon as an approved writer on ethics  hutchesons short introduction to moral philosophy was used as a textbook at the college of philadelphia in the s francis alison the professor of moral philosophy at the college of philadelphia was a former student of hutcheson who closely followed hutcheson’s thought alisons students included a surprisingly large number of active wellknown patriots” including three signers of the declaration of independence who learned their patriotic principles from hutcheson and alison”  another signer of the declaration of independence john witherspoon of the college of new jersey now princeton university relied heavily on hutchesons views in his own lectures on moral philosophy john adams read hutchesons short introduction to moral philosophy shortly after graduating from harvard garry wills argued in  that the phrasing of the declaration of independence was due largely to hutchesons influence but willss work suffered a scathing

hutcheson  august  –  august  was an irish philosopher born in ulster to a family of scottish presbyterians who became known as founding fathers of the scottish enlightenment hutcheson took ideas from

links early lifeedit he is thought to have been born at drumalig in the parish of saintfield county down ireland he was the son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock who was born in ireland hutcheson was educated at killyleagh and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow where he spent six years at first in the study of philosophy classics and general literature and afterwards in the study of theology receiving his degree in  while a student he worked as tutor to the earl of kilmarnock return to irelandedit facing suspicions about his irish roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success so he left the church returning to ireland to pursue a career in academia he was induced to start a private academy in dublin where he taught for  years also studying philosophy and produced during  inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue this writing is written as two treatises the subject of the first is aesthetics concerning beauty order harmony design and the second morality concerning moral good and evil in dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants among these was the rt hon and most rev dr william king the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishops court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence hutchesons relations with the clergy of the established church especially with archbishop king and with the rt hon and most rev dr hugh boulter lord archbishop of armagh seem to have been cordial and his biographer speaking of the inclination of his friends to serve him the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotioncitation needed etc probably refers to some offers of preferment on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination in  hutcheson married his cousin mary daughter of francis wilson of longford her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of drumnacross garrinch and knockeagh in county longford they had seven children of whom only one survived also called francis while living in dublin hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design and inquiry concerning moral good and evil in  the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in  the alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in  to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter  a criticism of thomas hobbes and the observations on the fable of the bees being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus letters a periodical that appeared in dublin – nd ed  at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet probably the second son of the rt rev dr gilbert burnet lord bishop of salisbury on the true foundation of virtue or moral goodness all these letters were collected in one volume glasgow  chair of moral philosophy at glasgowedit in  hutcheson succeeded his old master gershom carmichael in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin it is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously but their authorship appears to have been well known in  he entered on the duties of his office delivering an inaugural lecture afterwards published de naturali hominum socialitate about the natural fellowship of mankind he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me suum olim alumnum in libertatem asseruisse audiveramcitation needed i was therefore moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me its one time alumnus into freedom yet the works on which hutchesons reputation rests had already been published during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith the economist and philosopher the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson’s system of moral philosophy  is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations however it was likely something other than hutchesons written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor hutcheson other worksedit in addition to the works named the following were published during hutchesons lifetime a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage  philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens lib iii glasgow  metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens glasgow  the last work was published anonymously after his death his son francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works a system of moral philosophy in three books  vols london  to this is prefixed a life of the author by dr william leechman professor of divinity in the university of glasgow the only remaining work assigned to hutcheson is a small treatise on logic glasgow  this compendium together with the compendium of metaphysics was republished at strassburg in  thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics logic and ethics his importance is however due almost entirely to his ethical writings and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue the functions assigned to the moral sense the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare ethicsedit according to hutcheson man has a variety of senses internal as well as external reflex as well as direct the general definition of a sense being any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect  he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these senses but in various parts of his works he specifies besides the five external senses commonly recognized which he hints might be added to consciousness by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind metaph syn pars i cap  the sense of beauty sometimes called specifically an internal sense a public sense or sensus communis a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery the moral sense or moral sense of beauty in actions and affections by which we perceive virtue or vice in ourselves or others a sense of honour or praise and blame which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure and their dislike condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame a sense of the ridiculous it is plain as the author confesses that there may be other perceptions distinct from all these classes and in fact there seems to be no limit to the number of senses in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these senses the moral sense plays the most important part in hutchesons ethical system it pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections approving those that are virtuous and disapproving those that are vicious his principal design he says in the preface to the two first treatises is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions and accordingly to regulate its conduct the weakness of our reason and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent and their contraries pernicious the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies he has made virtue a lovely form to excite our pursuit of it and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage as well as the assumption that the moral sense has had no growth or history but was implanted in man exactly as found among the more civilized races an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler his use of the term sense tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for as established by hume this act consists of two parts an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process we refer the action or habit to a certain class but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of apparently the same class excited in us on former occasions even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous uniform and exempt from error the former is not all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action and does not ignore it even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless hutcheson both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation has done much to favour that loose popular view of morality which ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term moral sense which it may be noticed had already been employed by shaftesbury not only as william whewell suggests in the margin but also in the text of his inquiry if invariably coupled with the term moral judgement would be open to little objection but taken alone as designating the complex process of moral approbation it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors for if each persons decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense why be at any pains to test correct or review them or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible and how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies and the observable changes in a persons own views the expression has in fact the fault of most metaphorical terms it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately he does not like butler conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson as with shaftesbury its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle but even in the use of the phrase the greatest happiness for the greatest number inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutchesons virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra proposed for the purpose of computing the morality of actions this calculus occurs in the inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutchesons other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the benevolent theory of morals hobbes had maintained that all other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy have their roots in selflove hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions but by a not unnatural recoil that it is the only source of those actions of which on reflection we approve consistently with this position actions that flow from selflove only are morally indifferent but surely by the common consent of civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry selfrespect and in general the personal virtues are regarded and rightly regarded as fitting objects of moral approbation this consideration could hardly escape any author however wedded to his own system and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system and may thus be in part an object of his own benevolence ibid a curious abuse of terms which really concedes the question at issue moreover he acknowledges that though selflove does not merit approbation neither except in its extreme forms did it merit condemnation indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of selflove is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task the vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in hutchesons professedly ethical works but in the synopsis metaphysicae he touches on it in three places briefly stating both sides of the question but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind and that the only true

ipsis similes aut saltem earum habitudines si non veras quantitates depingant pars ii cap i locke does speak of god annexing certain ideas to certain motions of bodies but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by hutcheson which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of nicolas malebranche as of those of locke amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness the distinction between body and mind corpus or materia and res cogitans is more emphatically accentuated by hutcheson than by locke generally he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body though in the posthumous work on moral philosophy he expressly states that we know mind as we know body by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown bk i ch  the distinction between perception proper and sensation proper which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out see hamiltons lectures on metaphysics – lect  hamiltons edition of dugald stewarts works v  the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty severely criticized in sir w hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect xii and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke the last point can hardly fail to suggest the commonsense philosophy of reid thus in estimating hutchesons position we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to locke but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his scottish successors the short compendium of logic which is more original than such works usually are is remarkable chiefly for the large proportion of psychological matter that it contains in these parts of the book hutcheson mainly follows locke the technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over and the book is readable it may be specially noticed that he distinguishes between the mental result and its verbal expression judgmentproposition that he constantly employs the word idea and that he defines logical truth as convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis or propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis syn metaph pars i cap  thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic aestheticsedit hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics his speculations on this subject are contained in the inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design the first of the two treatises published in  he maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty harmony and proportion this is a reflex sense because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing it may be called an internal sense both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight and hearing and because in some other affairs where our external senses are not much concerned we discern a sort of beauty very like in many respects to that observed in sensible objects and accompanied with like pleasure inquiry etc sect  xi the latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions thus the analogy between beauty and virtue which was so favourite a topic with shaftesbury is prominent in the writings of hutcheson also scattered up and down the treatise there are many important and interesting observations that our limits prevent us from noticing but to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application insisting on there being a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects antecedent to all custom education or example see inquiry etc sects   hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect  ad fin hutchesons writings gave rise to much controversy to say nothing of minor opponents such as philaretus gilbert burnet already alluded to dr john balguy – prebendary of salisbury the author of two tracts on the foundation of moral goodness and dr john taylor – of norwich a minister of considerable reputation in his time author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson the essays appear to have suggested by antagonism at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butlers dissertation on the nature of virtue and richard prices treatise of moral good and evil  in this latter work the author maintains in opposition to hutcheson that actions are – in themselves right or wrong that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding we thus see that not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth the system of hutcheson or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury contributed in large measure to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics later scholarly mentionedit references to hutcheson occur in histories both of general philosophy

unalienable rights with the collective right to resist oppressive government was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the s in  hutcheson was publicly endorsed in the annual semiofficial

hutcheson  august  –  august  was an irish philosopher born in ulster to a family of scottish presbyterians who became known as founding fathers of the scottish enlightenment hutcheson took ideas from

links early lifeedit he is thought to have been born at drumalig in the parish of saintfield county down ireland he was the son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock who was born in ireland hutcheson was educated at killyleagh and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow where he spent six years at first in the study of philosophy classics and general literature and afterwards in the study of theology receiving his degree in  while a student he worked as tutor to the earl of kilmarnock return to irelandedit facing suspicions about his irish roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success so he left the church returning to ireland to pursue a career in academia he was induced to start a private academy in dublin where he taught for  years also studying philosophy and produced during  inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue this writing is written as two treatises the subject of the first is aesthetics concerning beauty order harmony design and the second morality concerning moral good and evil in dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants among these was the rt hon and most rev dr william king the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishops court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence hutchesons relations with the clergy of the established church especially with archbishop king and with the rt hon and most rev dr hugh boulter lord archbishop of armagh seem to have been cordial and his biographer speaking of the inclination of his friends to serve him the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotioncitation needed etc probably refers to some offers of preferment on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination in  hutcheson married his cousin mary daughter of francis wilson of longford her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of drumnacross garrinch and knockeagh in county longford they had seven children of whom only one survived also called francis while living in dublin hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design and inquiry concerning moral good and evil in  the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in  the alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in  to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter  a criticism of thomas hobbes and the observations on the fable of the bees being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus letters a periodical that appeared in dublin – nd ed  at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet probably the second son of the rt rev dr gilbert burnet lord bishop of salisbury on the true foundation of virtue or moral goodness all these letters were collected in one volume glasgow  chair of moral philosophy at glasgowedit in  hutcheson succeeded his old master gershom carmichael in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin it is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously but their authorship appears to have been well known in  he entered on the duties of his office delivering an inaugural lecture afterwards published de naturali hominum socialitate about the natural fellowship of mankind he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me suum olim alumnum in libertatem asseruisse audiveramcitation needed i was therefore moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me its one time alumnus into freedom yet the works on which hutchesons reputation rests had already been published during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith the economist and philosopher the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson’s system of moral philosophy  is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations however it was likely something other than hutchesons written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor hutcheson other worksedit in addition to the works named the following were published during hutchesons lifetime a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage  philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens lib iii glasgow  metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens glasgow  the last work was published anonymously after his death his son francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works a system of moral philosophy in three books  vols london  to this is prefixed a life of the author by dr william leechman professor of divinity in the university of glasgow the only remaining work assigned to hutcheson is a small treatise on logic glasgow  this compendium together with the compendium of metaphysics was republished at strassburg in  thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics logic and ethics his importance is however due almost entirely to his ethical writings and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue the functions assigned to the moral sense the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare ethicsedit according to hutcheson man has a variety of senses internal as well as external reflex as well as direct the general definition of a sense being any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect  he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these senses but in various parts of his works he specifies besides the five external senses commonly recognized which he hints might be added to consciousness by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind metaph syn pars i cap  the sense of beauty sometimes called specifically an internal sense a public sense or sensus communis a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery the moral sense or moral sense of beauty in actions and affections by which we perceive virtue or vice in ourselves or others a sense of honour or praise and blame which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure and their dislike condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame a sense of the ridiculous it is plain as the author confesses that there may be other perceptions distinct from all these classes and in fact there seems to be no limit to the number of senses in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these senses the moral sense plays the most important part in hutchesons ethical system it pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections approving those that are virtuous and disapproving those that are vicious his principal design he says in the preface to the two first treatises is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions and accordingly to regulate its conduct the weakness of our reason and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent and their contraries pernicious the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies he has made virtue a lovely form to excite our pursuit of it and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage as well as the assumption that the moral sense has had no growth or history but was implanted in man exactly as found among the more civilized races an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler his use of the term sense tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for as established by hume this act consists of two parts an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process we refer the action or habit to a certain class but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of apparently the same class excited in us on former occasions even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous uniform and exempt from error the former is not all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action and does not ignore it even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless hutcheson both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation has done much to favour that loose popular view of morality which ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term moral sense which it may be noticed had already been employed by shaftesbury not only as william whewell suggests in the margin but also in the text of his inquiry if invariably coupled with the term moral judgement would be open to little objection but taken alone as designating the complex process of moral approbation it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors for if each persons decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense why be at any pains to test correct or review them or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible and how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies and the observable changes in a persons own views the expression has in fact the fault of most metaphorical terms it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately he does not like butler conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson as with shaftesbury its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle but even in the use of the phrase the greatest happiness for the greatest number inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutchesons virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra proposed for the purpose of computing the morality of actions this calculus occurs in the inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutchesons other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the benevolent theory of morals hobbes had maintained that all other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy have their roots in selflove hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions but by a not unnatural recoil that it is the only source of those actions of which on reflection we approve consistently with this position actions that flow from selflove only are morally indifferent but surely by the common consent of civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry selfrespect and in general the personal virtues are regarded and rightly regarded as fitting objects of moral approbation this consideration could hardly escape any author however wedded to his own system and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system and may thus be in part an object of his own benevolence ibid a curious abuse of terms which really concedes the question at issue moreover he acknowledges that though selflove does not merit approbation neither except in its extreme forms did it merit condemnation indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of selflove is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task the vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in hutchesons professedly ethical works but in the synopsis metaphysicae he touches on it in three places briefly stating both sides of the question but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will not the liberty of willing as we will though however his leaning is clear he carefully avoids dogmatising and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise it is easy to trace the influence of hutchesons ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might probably in large measure attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume and if this be the case the name of hutcheson connects itself through hume with the names of priestley paley and bentham butlers sermons appeared in  the year after the publication of hutchesons two first essays and there are parallels between the conscience of the one writer and the moral sense of the other deathedit francis hutcheson spent time in dublin and died while on a visit to that city in  he is buried in the churchyard of saint mary’s which is also the final resting place of his cousin william bruce today saint mary’s is a public park located in what is now wolfe tone street many united irishmen would have revered the memory of francis hutcheson some of the leaders of the dublin united irishmen are remembered in the street and placenames of the city most dubliners can direct a visitor to wolfe tone

implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic aestheticsedit hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics his speculations on this subject are contained in the inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design the first of the two treatises published in  he maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty harmony and proportion this is a reflex sense because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing it may be called an internal sense both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight and hearing and because in some other affairs where our external senses are not much concerned we discern a sort of beauty very like in many respects to that observed in sensible objects and accompanied with like pleasure inquiry etc sect  xi the latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions thus the analogy between beauty and virtue which was so favourite a topic with shaftesbury is prominent in the writings of hutcheson also scattered up and down the treatise there are many important and interesting observations that our limits prevent us from noticing but to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application insisting on there being a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects antecedent to all custom education or example see inquiry etc sects   hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect  ad fin hutchesons writings gave rise to much controversy to say nothing of minor opponents such as philaretus gilbert burnet already alluded to dr john balguy – prebendary of salisbury the author of two tracts on the foundation of moral goodness and dr john taylor – of norwich a minister of considerable reputation in his time author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson the essays appear to have suggested by antagonism at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butlers dissertation on the nature of virtue and richard prices treatise of moral good and evil  in this latter work the author maintains in opposition to hutcheson that actions are – in themselves right or wrong that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding we thus see that not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth the system of hutcheson or at least the system of hutcheson combined with that of shaftesbury contributed in large measure to the formation and development of some of the most important of the modern schools of ethics later scholarly mentionedit references to hutcheson occur in histories both of general philosophy

unalienable rights with the collective right to resist oppressive government was used at harvard college as a textbook as early as the s in  hutcheson was publicly endorsed in the annual semiofficial

hutcheson  august  –  august  was an irish philosopher born in ulster to a family of scottish presbyterians who became known as founding fathers of the scottish enlightenment hutcheson took ideas from

links early lifeedit he is thought to have been born at drumalig in the parish of saintfield county down ireland he was the son of a presbyterian minister of ulster scottish stock who was born in ireland hutcheson was educated at killyleagh and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow where he spent six years at first in the study of philosophy classics and general literature and afterwards in the study of theology receiving his degree in  while a student he worked as tutor to the earl of kilmarnock return to irelandedit facing suspicions about his irish roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success so he left the church returning to ireland to pursue a career in academia he was induced to start a private academy in dublin where he taught for  years also studying philosophy and produced during  inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue this writing is written as two treatises the subject of the first is aesthetics concerning beauty order harmony design and the second morality concerning moral good and evil in dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants among these was the rt hon and most rev dr william king the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishops court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence hutchesons relations with the clergy of the established church especially with archbishop king and with the rt hon and most rev dr hugh boulter lord archbishop of armagh seem to have been cordial and his biographer speaking of the inclination of his friends to serve him the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotioncitation needed etc probably refers to some offers of preferment on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination in  hutcheson married his cousin mary daughter of francis wilson of longford her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of drumnacross garrinch and knockeagh in county longford they had seven children of whom only one survived also called francis while living in dublin hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design and inquiry concerning moral good and evil in  the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in  the alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in  to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter  a criticism of thomas hobbes and the observations on the fable of the bees being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus letters a periodical that appeared in dublin – nd ed  at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet probably the second son of the rt rev dr gilbert burnet lord bishop of salisbury on the true foundation of virtue or moral goodness all these letters were collected in one volume glasgow  chair of moral philosophy at glasgowedit in  hutcheson succeeded his old master gershom carmichael in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin it is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously but their authorship appears to have been well known in  he entered on the duties of his office delivering an inaugural lecture afterwards published de naturali hominum socialitate about the natural fellowship of mankind he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me suum olim alumnum in libertatem asseruisse audiveramcitation needed i was therefore moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me its one time alumnus into freedom yet the works on which hutchesons reputation rests had already been published during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith the economist and philosopher the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson’s system of moral philosophy  is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations however it was likely something other than hutchesons written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor hutcheson other worksedit in addition to the works named the following were published during hutchesons lifetime a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage  philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens lib iii glasgow  metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens glasgow  the last work was published anonymously after his death his son francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works a system of moral philosophy in three books  vols london  to this is prefixed a life of the author by dr william leechman professor of divinity in the university of glasgow the only remaining work assigned to hutcheson is a small treatise on logic glasgow  this compendium together with the compendium of metaphysics was republished at strassburg in  thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics logic and ethics his importance is however due almost entirely to his ethical writings and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue the functions assigned to the moral sense the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare ethicsedit according to hutcheson man has a variety of senses internal as well as external reflex as well as direct the general definition of a sense being any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect  he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these senses but in various parts of his works he specifies besides the five external senses commonly recognized which he hints might be added to consciousness by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind metaph syn pars i cap  the sense of beauty sometimes called specifically an internal sense a public sense or sensus communis a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery the moral sense or moral sense of beauty in actions and affections by which we perceive virtue or vice in ourselves or others a sense of honour or praise and blame which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure and their dislike condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame a sense of the ridiculous it is plain as the author confesses that there may be other perceptions distinct from all these classes and in fact there seems to be no limit to the number of senses in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these senses the moral sense plays the most important part in hutchesons ethical system it pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections approving those that are virtuous and disapproving those that are vicious his principal design he says in the preface to the two first treatises is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions and accordingly to regulate its conduct the weakness of our reason and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent and their contraries pernicious the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies he has made virtue a lovely form to excite our pursuit of it and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage as well as the assumption that the moral sense has had no growth or history but was implanted in man exactly as found among the more civilized races an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler his use of the term sense tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for as established by hume this act consists of two parts an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process we refer the action or habit to a certain class but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of apparently the same class excited in us on former occasions even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous uniform and exempt from error the former is not all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action and does not ignore it even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless hutcheson both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation has done much to favour that loose popular view of morality which ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term moral sense which it may be noticed had already been employed by shaftesbury not only as william whewell suggests in the margin but also in the text of his inquiry if invariably coupled with the term moral judgement would be open to little objection but taken alone as designating the complex process of moral approbation it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors for if each persons decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense why be at any pains to test correct or review them or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible and how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies and the observable changes in a persons own views the expression has in fact the fault of most metaphorical terms it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately he does not like butler conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson as with shaftesbury its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle but even in the use of the phrase the greatest happiness for the greatest number inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutchesons virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra proposed for the purpose of computing the morality of actions this calculus occurs in the inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutchesons other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the benevolent theory of morals hobbes had maintained that all other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy have their roots in selflove hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions but by a not unnatural recoil that it is the only source of those actions of which on reflection we approve consistently with this position actions that flow from selflove only are morally indifferent but surely by the common consent of civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry selfrespect and in general the personal virtues are regarded and rightly regarded as fitting objects of moral approbation this consideration could hardly escape any author however wedded to his own system and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system and may thus be in part an object of his own benevolence ibid a curious abuse of terms which really concedes the question at issue moreover he acknowledges that though selflove does not merit approbation neither except in its extreme forms did it merit condemnation indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of selflove is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task the vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in hutchesons professedly ethical works but in the synopsis metaphysicae he touches on it in three places briefly stating both sides of the question but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will not the liberty of willing as we will though however his leaning is clear he carefully avoids dogmatising and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise it is easy to trace the influence of hutchesons ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might probably in large measure attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume and if this be the case the name of hutcheson connects itself through hume with the names of priestley paley and bentham butlers sermons appeared in  the year after the publication of hutchesons two first essays and there are parallels between the conscience of the one writer and the moral sense of the other deathedit francis hutcheson spent time in dublin and died while on a visit to that city in  he is buried in the churchyard of saint mary’s which is also the final resting place of his cousin william bruce today saint mary’s is a public park located in what is now wolfe tone street many united irishmen would have revered the memory of francis hutcheson some of the leaders of the dublin united irishmen are remembered in the street and placenames of the city most dubliners can direct a visitor to wolfe tone street oliver bond street russell street lord edward street and emmet road ‘never to be forgotten hutcheson’ lies in what is now an unmarked grave in the dublin he loved and ‘where his best work was done’ mental philosophyedit in the sphere of mental philosophy and logic hutchesons contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy they are interesting mainly as a link between locke and the scottish school in the former subject the influence of locke is apparent throughout all the main outlines of lockes philosophy seem at first sight to be accepted as a matter of course thus in stating his theory of the moral sense hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas see for instance inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect i ad fin and sect  and compare synopsis metaphysicae pars i cap  at the same time he shows more discrimination than does locke in distinguishing between the two uses of this expression and between the legitimate and illegitimate form of the doctrine syn metaph pars i cap  all our ideas are as by locke referred to external or internal sense or in other words to sensation and reflection it is however a most important modification of lockes doctrine and connects hutchesons mental philosophy with that of reid when he states that the ideas of extension figure motion and rest are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses that the idea of self accompanies every thought and that the ideas of number duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever see essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect i art i syn metaph pars i cap  pars ii cap i hamilton on reid p  note other important points in which hutcheson follows the lead of locke are his depreciation of the importance of the socalled laws of thought his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies the position that we cannot know the inmost essences of things intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae though they excite various ideas in us and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas syn metaph pars i cap i though at the same time we are assured of the existence of an external world corresponding to these ideas hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct syn metaph pars i cap  of the correspondence or similitude between our ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves god alone can be assigned as the cause this similitude has been effected by him through a law of nature haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio sive mentis actio quaedam sive passio dicatur non alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur quam ipse deus qui certa naturae lege hoc efilcit ut notiones quae rebus praesentibus excitantur sint ipsis similes aut saltem earum habitudines si non veras quantitates depingant pars ii cap i locke does speak of god annexing certain ideas to certain motions of bodies but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by hutcheson which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of nicolas malebranche as of those of locke amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness the distinction between body and mind

perception proper and sensation proper which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out see hamiltons lectures on metaphysics – lect  hamiltons edition of dugald stewarts works v  the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty severely criticized in sir w hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect xii and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke the last point can hardly fail to suggest the commonsense philosophy of reid thus in estimating hutchesons position

hutcheson  august  –  august  was an irish philosopher born in ulster to a family of scottish presbyterians who became known as founding fathers of the scottish enlightenment hutcheson took ideas from

ireland hutcheson was educated at killyleagh and went on to scotland to study at the university of glasgow where he spent six years at first in the study of philosophy classics and general literature and afterwards in the study of theology receiving his degree in  while a student he worked as tutor to the earl of kilmarnock return to irelandedit facing suspicions about his irish roots and his association with new licht theologian john simson then under investigation by scottish ecclesiastical courts a ministry for him in scotland was unlikely to be a success so he left the church returning to ireland to pursue a career in academia he was induced to start a private academy in dublin where he taught for  years also studying philosophy and produced during  inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue this writing is written as two treatises the subject of the first is aesthetics concerning beauty order harmony design and the second morality concerning moral good and evil in dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants among these was the rt hon and most rev dr william king the church of ireland lord archbishop of dublin who refused to prosecute hutcheson in the archbishops court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence hutchesons relations with the clergy of the established church especially with archbishop king and with the rt hon and most rev dr hugh boulter lord archbishop of armagh seem to have been cordial and his biographer speaking of the inclination of his friends to serve him the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotioncitation needed etc probably refers to some offers of preferment on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination in  hutcheson married his cousin mary daughter of francis wilson of longford her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of drumnacross garrinch and knockeagh in county longford they had seven children of whom only one survived also called francis while living in dublin hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design and inquiry concerning moral good and evil in  the essay on the nature and conduct of the passions and affections and illustrations upon the moral sense in  the alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in  to the period of his dublin residence are also to be referred the thoughts on laughter  a criticism of thomas hobbes and the observations on the fable of the bees being in all six letters contributed to hibernicus letters a periodical that appeared in dublin – nd ed  at the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the london journal with gilbert burnet probably the second son of the rt rev dr gilbert burnet lord bishop of salisbury on the true foundation of virtue or moral goodness all these letters were collected in one volume glasgow  chair of moral philosophy at glasgowedit in  hutcheson succeeded his old master gershom carmichael in the chair of moral philosophy at the university of glasgow being the first professor there to lecture in english instead of latin it is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously but their authorship appears to have been well known in  he entered on the duties of his office delivering an inaugural lecture afterwards published de naturali hominum socialitate about the natural fellowship of mankind he appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies non levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem academiam me suum olim alumnum in libertatem asseruisse audiveramcitation needed i was therefore moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when i had heard that my alma mater had delivered me its one time alumnus into freedom yet the works on which hutchesons reputation rests had already been published during his time as a lecturer in glasgow college he taught and influenced adam smith the economist and philosopher the order of topics discussed in the economic portion of hutcheson’s system of moral philosophy  is repeated by smith in his glasgow lectures and again in the wealth of nations however it was likely something other than hutchesons written work that had such a great influence on smith hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents of glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations his roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor hutcheson other worksedit in addition to the works named the following were published during hutchesons lifetime a pamphlet entitled considerations on patronage  philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens lib iii glasgow  metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens glasgow  the last work was published anonymously after his death his son francis hutcheson published much the longest of his works a system of moral philosophy in three books  vols london  to this is prefixed a life of the author by dr william leechman professor of divinity in the university of glasgow the only remaining work assigned to hutcheson is a small treatise on logic glasgow  this compendium together with the compendium of metaphysics was republished at strassburg in  thus hutcheson dealt with metaphysics logic and ethics his importance is however due almost entirely to his ethical writings and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in dublin his standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect he is in strong opposition to thomas hobbes and mandeville and in fundamental agreement with shaftesbury whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue the functions assigned to the moral sense the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare ethicsedit according to hutcheson man has a variety of senses internal as well as external reflex as well as direct the general definition of a sense being any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect  he does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these senses but in various parts of his works he specifies besides the five external senses commonly recognized which he hints might be added to consciousness by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind metaph syn pars i cap  the sense of beauty sometimes called specifically an internal sense a public sense or sensus communis a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery the moral sense or moral sense of beauty in actions and affections by which we perceive virtue or vice in ourselves or others a sense of honour or praise and blame which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure and their dislike condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame a sense of the ridiculous it is plain as the author confesses that there may be other perceptions distinct from all these classes and in fact there seems to be no limit to the number of senses in which a psychological division of this kind might result of these senses the moral sense plays the most important part in hutchesons ethical system it pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections approving those that are virtuous and disapproving those that are vicious his principal design he says in the preface to the two first treatises is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions and accordingly to regulate its conduct the weakness of our reason and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent and their contraries pernicious the author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies he has made virtue a lovely form to excite our pursuit of it and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage as well as the assumption that the moral sense has had no growth or history but was implanted in man exactly as found among the more civilized races an assumption common to both hutcheson and butler his use of the term sense tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement for as established by hume this act consists of two parts an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad by the intellectual part of this process we refer the action or habit to a certain class but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of apparently the same class excited in us on former occasions even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous uniform and exempt from error the former is not all mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action and does not ignore it even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action nonetheless hutcheson both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation has done much to favour that loose popular view of morality which ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements the term moral sense which it may be noticed had already been employed by shaftesbury not only as william whewell suggests in the margin but also in the text of his inquiry if invariably coupled with the term moral judgement would be open to little objection but taken alone as designating the complex process of moral approbation it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors for if each persons decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense why be at any pains to test correct or review them or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible and how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies and the observable changes in a persons own views the expression has in fact the fault of most metaphorical terms it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest but though hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately he does not like butler conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard the test or criterion of right action is with hutcheson as with shaftesbury its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind he thus anticipates the utilitarianism of bentham—and not only in principle but even in the use of the phrase the greatest happiness for the greatest number inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results and hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption connected with hutchesons virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra proposed for the purpose of computing the morality of actions this calculus occurs in the inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect  hutchesons other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the benevolent theory of morals hobbes had maintained that all other actions however disguised under apparent sympathy have their roots in selflove hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions but by a not unnatural recoil that it is the only source of those actions of which on reflection we approve consistently with this position actions that flow from selflove only are morally indifferent but surely by the common consent of civilized men prudence temperance cleanliness industry selfrespect and in general the personal virtues are regarded and rightly regarded as fitting objects of moral approbation this consideration could hardly escape any author however wedded to his own system and hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system and may thus be in part an object of his own benevolence ibid a curious abuse of terms which really concedes the question at issue moreover he acknowledges that though selflove does not merit approbation neither except in its extreme forms did it merit condemnation indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of selflove is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society to press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task the vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in hutchesons professedly ethical works but in the synopsis metaphysicae he touches on it in three places briefly stating both sides of the question but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the stoics in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the peripatetics this is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by hobbes and locke to the latter of whom hutcheson refers in a note namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will not the liberty of willing as we will though however his leaning is clear he carefully avoids dogmatising and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise it is easy to trace the influence of hutchesons ethical theories on the systems of hume and adam smith the prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes is undoubtedly due to the influence of hutcheson to a study of the writings of shaftesbury and hutcheson we might probably in large measure attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by hume and if this be the case the name of hutcheson connects itself through hume with the names of priestley paley and bentham butlers sermons appeared in  the year after the publication of hutchesons two first essays and there are parallels between the conscience of the one writer and the moral sense of the other deathedit francis hutcheson spent time in dublin and died while on a visit to that city in  he is buried in the churchyard of saint mary’s which is also the final resting place of his cousin william bruce today saint mary’s is a public park located in what is now wolfe tone street many united irishmen would have revered the memory of francis hutcheson some of the leaders of the dublin united irishmen are remembered in the street and placenames of the city most dubliners can direct a visitor to wolfe tone street oliver bond street russell street lord edward street and emmet road ‘never to be forgotten hutcheson’ lies in what is now an unmarked grave in the dublin he loved and ‘where his best work was done’ mental philosophyedit in the sphere of mental philosophy and logic hutchesons contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy they are interesting mainly as a link between locke and the scottish school in the former subject the influence of locke is apparent throughout all the main outlines of lockes philosophy seem at first sight to be accepted as a matter of course thus in stating his theory of the moral sense hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas see for instance inquiry concerning moral good and evil sect i ad fin and sect  and compare synopsis metaphysicae pars i cap  at the same time he shows more discrimination than does locke in distinguishing between the two uses of this expression and between the legitimate and illegitimate form of the doctrine syn metaph pars i cap  all our ideas are as by locke referred to external or internal sense or in other words to sensation and reflection it is however a most important modification of lockes doctrine and connects hutchesons mental philosophy with that of reid when he states that the ideas of extension figure motion and rest are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses that the idea of self accompanies every thought and that the ideas of number duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever see essay on the nature and conduct of the passions sect i art i syn metaph pars i cap  pars ii cap i hamilton on reid p  note other important points in which hutcheson follows the lead of locke are his depreciation of the importance of the socalled laws of thought his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies the position that we cannot know the inmost essences of things intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae though they excite various ideas in us and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas syn metaph pars i cap i though at the same time we are assured of the existence of an external world corresponding to these ideas hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct syn metaph pars i cap  of the correspondence or similitude between our ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves god alone can be assigned as the cause this similitude has been effected by him through a law of nature haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio sive mentis actio quaedam sive passio dicatur non alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur quam ipse deus qui certa naturae lege hoc efilcit ut notiones quae rebus praesentibus excitantur sint ipsis similes aut saltem earum habitudines si non veras quantitates depingant pars ii cap i locke does speak of god annexing certain ideas to certain motions of bodies but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by hutcheson which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of nicolas malebranche as of those of locke amongst the more important points in which hutcheson diverges from locke is his account of the idea of personal identity which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness the distinction between body and mind corpus or materia and res cogitans is more emphatically accentuated by hutcheson than by locke generally he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body though in the posthumous work on moral philosophy he expressly states that we know mind as we know body by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown bk i ch  the distinction between perception proper and sensation proper which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out see hamiltons lectures on metaphysics – lect  hamiltons edition of dugald stewarts works v  the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty severely criticized in sir w hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect xii and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of locke the last point can hardly fail to suggest the commonsense philosophy of reid thus in estimating hutchesons position we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to locke but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his scottish successors the short compendium of logic which is more original than such works usually are is remarkable chiefly for the large proportion of psychological matter that it contains in these parts of the book hutcheson mainly follows locke the technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over and the book is readable it may be specially noticed that he distinguishes between the mental result and its verbal expression judgmentproposition that he constantly employs the word idea and that he defines logical truth as convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis or propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis syn metaph pars i cap  thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic aestheticsedit hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics his speculations on this subject are contained in the inquiry concerning beauty order harmony and design the first of the two treatises published in  he maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty harmony and proportion this is a reflex sense because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing it may be called an internal sense both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere

antecedent to all custom education or example see inquiry etc sects   hamiltons lectures on metaphysics lect  ad fin hutchesons writings gave rise to much controversy to say nothing of minor opponents such as philaretus gilbert burnet already alluded to dr john balguy – prebendary of salisbury the author of two tracts on the foundation of moral goodness and dr john taylor – of norwich a minister of considerable reputation in his time author of an examination of the scheme of amorality advanced by dr hutcheson the essays appear to have suggested by antagonism at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of english ethics—butlers dissertation on the nature of virtue and richard prices treatise of moral good and evil  in this latter work the author maintains in opposition to hutcheson that actions are – in themselves right or wrong that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding
