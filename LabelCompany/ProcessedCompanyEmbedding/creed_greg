company’s pizza hut business “might be the brand that surprises everybody” but even as the louisville kybased company has churned out positive results in its kfc and taco bell units over the past year the turnaround has been slower to take hold for pizza hut still mr creed remains optimistic greg creed ceo of yum brands “i think the great thing about pizza hut is we don’t have a pizza problem we don’t have a product problem” mr creed told participants at the rbc capital markets consumer and retail conference held june  in boston the issue he said is consumers are having problems getting the company’s pizza whether it’s ordering the pizza or having the pizza delivered the issue of easy access has been a major barrier to growth mr creed said “that’s very fixable” he said noting the company is putting more effort into executing a digital deliverycentric strategy for the brand in the united states whether it’s ordering pizza or having pizza delivered the issue of easy access has been a major barrier to growth for pizza hut   pizza hut has been in socalled turnaround mode for several years in  the company doubled its number of ingredient and flavor options as part of a comprehensive menu overhaul which included  new crust flavors  new sauces and  new recipes at the time yum executives hoped the new flavors would lure lapsed consumers back to the brand when that new platform failed to deliver expected results pizza hut turned to a value approach the following year with the introduction of the triple treat box featuring two medium onetopping pizzas an order of breadsticks

popular brand  qsr magazine jump to navigation executive insights  june   by sam oches bell on the ball greg creed ceo of taco bell talks about the company’s secret salt reductions why he’s not afraid of chipotle and oh yeah that pesky beef lawsuit image used with permission bookmarksearch this post email this story printerfriendly version read more about chipotle drive thru legal menu innovations sam oches taco bell a group of cartoon superheroes dubbed the super delicious ingredient force that lives in a “fortress of flavor” will never be the stars of a marketing campaign for panera bread chipotle ceo steve ells will never say that a  taco is expensive and it’s highly unlikely that mcdonald’s will issue a public statement thanking the center for science in the public interest for its legal action against happy meals but then again none of those chains present quite the quickserve offering that taco bell does—not in product not in value and not in branding the yearold mexican category leader marches to the beat of its own drum comfortable serving cheap food to a younger demographic that finds characters named captain enchilada sauce and steak maximus funny even company ceo greg creed is not your typical closetothevest sticktothescript kind of leader the yearold aussie is chatty honest and intimately rooted in his company he says he’s facebook friends with half of his corporate staff and his first reaction to the january class action lawsuit filed against the company over the contents of its beef was to be sad for the reputations of both taco bell and its plus workforce if creed has a secret to how taco bell is maintaining its success without succumbing to the chinadishing latteserving organictouting trends of the quickserve industry it’s this “if you understand what you as a brand stand for if you understand the role that your brand plays in people’s lives and how you make their lives better then i believe you can be successful in good times and bad” he says of course the last few years have been what many in the quickserve industry would call bad times when the economy tanked in  so did customers’ discretionary incomes and willingness to spend on food outside the home with already some of the lowest prices in the industry though taco bell was not forced to do what many in the restaurant industry rushed to at the height of the recession—deep discounting the yum brands concept was already offering about  items for  or less on its why pay more menu and the  meal deals unveiled in  gave customers four options that paired a burrito or taco with a drink and chips—a move that marked the twobuck price point as a magic number across the industry still now that the economy is improving and many restaurant companies are laying off their price slashing creed says that cheap food will continue to be taco bell’s strategy “i think there’s a large part of society that is still struggling and i think from our perspective that if you can give people really distinctive taste at unbeatable value you can be very successful both in the short term and the long term” he says “i think that’s what underpins our past success and what we believe will be our success going forward” yes value—one of those terms like fresh seemingly without a firm definition but which gets tossed around like dough in a pizzeria but creed does have a definition—or three—for fresh and he holds taco bell to its standards in every new menu item the chain rolls out “there’s what we call price value and price value is where there’s a really low price—cent tacos cent burritos—where you’re not paying a lot of money” he says “then there’s what we call abundant value and abundant value is what i get divided by what i pay … the third one is what i would call a quality value and probably a good example of that right now is our shrimp taco and burrito that we’re promoting” the pacific shrimp taco along with the pacific shrimp burrito rolled out earlier this year it contains six shrimp tossed in a chipotle marinade and served on shredded lettuce salsa and avocado ranch sauce atop a flour tortilla “the taco costs  which considering we’re the home of the  cent tacos is quite expensive” creed says “but people are saying ‘i can’t get six shrimp for  anywhere in the world’ we call that quality value because the quality of the shrimp—the fact that we offer shrimp the fact that you can get six of them and the fact that it’s —is still amazing value “we say at taco bell ‘we make value matter’ whether you’re paying  cents  for a shrimp taco  for a  box or  for a  party pack with  tacos” he says “we’ve got to make sure value matters at whatever price point you want to participate at” despite the low price points taco bell continues to perform as the no  mexican quick serve—to an astounding degree in  the chain did  billion in us sales across  stores good for sixth place on this publication’s annual qsr  list its auv of  million was nearly three times as much as subway’s the no  mexican quickserve player del taco sits at no  on the qsr  doing  million in us sales across  stores companies like del taco taco john’s and taco bueno however are not the fast feeders creed considers competition that would be companies like mcdonald’s burger king and wendy’s which creed says taco bell competes with on the convenience front the mexican category though is building steam quickly taco bell no longer enjoys the total domination it once did in the field brands like chipotle qdoba and moe’s southwest grill are carrying the segment into the fastcasual realm to much success yet creed remains unwavering in his belief that taco bell fits a special niche in the marketplace one that is not in danger of succumbing to the upgrades of the fastcasual industry for starters creed says some people just want to pay less for mexican food—“when you go to a fast casual you’re paying  or  for a burrito” he says “there are a lot of people who don’t have  to pay for a burrito”—not to mention taco bell serves a much different lowerincome demographic than chipotle does pages  next › last » search form search subscribe tell us more… thank
