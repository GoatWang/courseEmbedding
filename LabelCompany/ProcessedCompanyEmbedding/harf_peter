reckitt benckiser and burger king he serves as chairman of coty the global beauty company and leader in fragrance he began his career at the boston consulting group in san francisco in  in  he joined benckiser focusing the company on consumer goods we had a lot of marginal pieces in our portfolio explains harf in those early years harf acquired around  companies im not afraid of taking risks im not afraid of losing im not afraid of buying something says harf in  he and bart becht took the detergent part of benckiser public subsequently in  this company merged with reckitt  colman forming reckitt benckiser the new firm thrived reaching a total shareholder return of  percent per year over a period of  years in  harf joined the board of anheuserbusch inbev then interbrew and today the largest brewer in the world he has served as chairman there since  peter harf was born in  in cologne germany he grew up an only child living right after the second world war in the completely destroyed cologne my mother  years young when i was born did the cooking and washing for  people he recalls she had tremendous energy there was no money but lots of love and happiness as a boy harf shared a room with a great uncle born in  who instilled in him an avid interest in history and politics my uncle died in  i was  years old no day passes that i do not remember stuff he told me as a little boy it is amazing how a great human being can shape a child and guide him through life after graduating first in his class from the university of cologne he earned a phd in economics despite a consuming lifelong passion for economics harf decided to become a businessman he had recently married the love of his life mechtild whom he had been dating for  years the pair moved to cambridge so he could attend hbs we had a fantastic time madly in love lots of friends great parties smart professors and the cape in the spring harf recalls he savored working with smart fellow students research into theoretical economics tends to be very lonely he observes after graduation harf moved to san francisco when his wife became pregnant with the first of their two daughters fittingly named viktoria she decided they should return to germany in family matters mechtild held the reins and i was riding shotgun she wanted our daughter to have a clear sense of belonging in  tragedy struck when mechtild was diagnosed with blood cancer she needed a bone marrow transplant but there was not a matching donor eventually she received a transplant after harf and his friends had started to frantically recruit potential bone marrow donors all over germany on her deathbed mechtild demanded that harf stay committed to the fight against blood cancer what happened to me should not happen to anyone harf recalls her saying put your business smarts to work there is more to life than making money harf and his daughter katharina left review documents at dkms harf and his wifes physician gerhard ehninger launched dkms the cure blood cancer bank dkms is not a charity but a highperformance nonprofit company driven by an impossible dream and a strong culture says harf today dkms has more than  million registered bone marrow donors worldwide and has facilitated some  transplants so many people tell me they wouldnt be alive if it werent for my father says harfs daughter katharina who serves as dkmss coo like the happy endings that harf has brought to many blood cancer patients there is a silver lining to his personal struggle with loss in  while promoting a line of cosmetics for women with cancer he met tina a creative advertising director and writer who had also lost a loved one to cancer they hit it off immediately and today are happily married dividing their time between milan and manhattan
