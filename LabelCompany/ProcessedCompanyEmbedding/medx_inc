management study culturenews medx inc publishes results from  integrated pest management study by nick phillips  apr     share facebook twitter image courtesy of naturecide medx inc a los angeles based ancillary products company recently published the results from its first research and development study the report focuses on its naturecide pesticide products and their uses in a proprietary integrated pest management ipm strategy for the cultivation of cannabis the report documents one of the company’s research cultivations that took place between august st  to march th  the objective of the study was to cultivate highgrade medicinal marijuana without the use of chemical pesticides the report indicates that they were successful in cultivating four strains from clone to curing without the use of any sort of chemical pesticides the final product from the harvest was tested by sc labs in march of  and those results are also included in the report findings the full report can be found here “we have the proprietary products and required certified expertise to practice pest management on agriculture in the state of california when cultivators from other legal states started using our products in the cannabis industry it was important for us to dive right in and prove internally that indeed our products and methods get the job done” said matthew mills coo of medx inc during the process of documenting the research grow the team was also able to create a simple ipm guide that walks a grower through the process of using the naturecide products while cultivating the report was published at a time when many los angeles based dispensaries were called into question after an nbc  report came out documenting a  rate of pesticides in tested products from over  local los angeles dispensaries “as much as people want to deny it growing world class cannabis without using chemical pesticides is possible and we set out to prove it this report proves to our community that with the right strategy any size operation can produce amazing results with confidence” said mills as state and city regulations are being finalized in california growers across the state are being forced to get their operations compliant – sooner rather than later “public health officials at the los angeles county level are very aware of the level of contamination in some of the medicinal product that is being sold our sources at the county level have indicated to us that progress is being made on how the rules and regulations will shape out and the number one focus will be geared toward public health and safety” explained mills as a consultant for the los angeles county fire department mills and his team have been hard at work pointing out the corners previous black market growers have cut over the years in hopes that the leadership at the county level will be patient as cultivators get on the same page mr mills and his team are hoping that all the commercial and private cultivators in the county will take the initiative to educate themselves on the building codes and requirements that all grow facilities will have to abide by in the near future “in this everchanging fastpaced industry of cannabis it is important to understand that our officials and the community have to work handinhand to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our citizens patients and customers we look forward to the day when together we can all look back and see how far we have come” related articlesmore from author will the doj task force report blame cannabis for violent crime colorado has collected over

correct the course of cannabis in america with new insecticidal soil press release by nick phillips  jan     share facebook twitter los angeles jan   prnewswire — as of late despite its nagging presence on the federal schedule i substance list cannabis reform has been sweeping the country thirtynine of  states have some sort of cannabis law on the books to legalize the medical side and four states alaska colorado oregon and washington as well as the district of columbia have completely adopted its legalization as those remaining states begin to see the massive tax benefits legalization brings and the medical uses of cannabis are better understood it won’t be long until cannabis is rescheduled or outright legalized federally the medical cannabis industry remains one of the least understood and least developed markets out there mostly because of its questionable legality this issue of legality not only touches the sale cultivation and transportation of cannabis but also every part of the medical cannabis industry chain the hurdles surrounding cannabis affect research and development distribution of product cultivation equipment production and even what kind of information about cannabis is accessible to the public clearly this difference in legality state by state causes havoc at every level of the medical cannabis industry but despite its current limitations medical cannabis is still a multibillion dollar industry there’s no denying that americans want their cannabis and are willing to support the market even through all of these hurdles but what happens after cannabis has been legalized when the federal government does finally take the step to legalize cannabis there will be a void created as states scramble to handle the quickly budding market at medx inc their management believes the first step needs to be better oversight and regulation while focusing within the greater industry medx has already taken steps to handle postlegalization america and they’re doing it by creating a company that can handle every aspect of the medical cannabis industry whether it’s cultivation research and development or information medx is building a business for the future of cannabis one of the ways the management at medx is accomplishing this is through a total overhaul of what people consider a cannabis company to be mostly when people think of the cannabis industry they see farmers in the mountains of california protecting their crops with guns or the lonely drug dealers that haunt apartment complexes slinging something from mexico there’s a real disconnect between what the cannabis industry was and what it will be by tackling the cannabis industry from a centralized standpoint we can control each link in the cannabis supply chain positively altering the entire industry for example take their first flagship product naturecide allpurpose insecticide developed as a completely nontoxic insecticide alternative developed for the cultivation of cannabis the formula is safe to use from sprout to harvest indoor or outdoor they developed it to be  safe and the only pesticide a cannabis cultivator will need by producing a product that is effective and safe as well as costeffective we strongly encourage the industry to choose our formula and produce better healthier plant life however we don’t just stop there medx is also engulfed in research and development of the cannabis industry just as much as it’s in the cannabis information industry and that means we keep innovating to improve on each link in the cannabis chain this is why after multiple cultivation tests in q of this year “we are releasing a new all natural insecticidal soil our special proprietary blend refined through research the soil protects the roots of the plant from pests while producing the kinds of crop yields cultivators hope for and expect” states cofounder and coo matthew mills “both the insecticidal soil and the naturecide all purpose insecticide are safe to use with any kind of cultivation project but they were developed specifically to satisfy each step of cannabis cultivation by providing exceptional products that have been proven safe and natural we can ensure cannabis gets grown to our particular standards and expectations for excellence” states mills the final and perhaps most important step that they have taken with medx is to open the company to the consumers medical cannabis is foremost a medicine and they are developing this company to be consumer facing from day one “the biggest and best way we can show our commitment to the people who need medical cannabis is through our current equity crowdfunding initiative on startengine” states ceo dr david toomey “as soon as the sec released its final ruling on equity crowdfunding regulations set forth in the jobs act we knew that it would be a great opportunity to involve and support our consumers equity crowdfunding through startengine allows us to build knowledge of our company and our initiative raise capital to serve our consumers and offer exciting potentially lifechanging investments to our biggest supporters though we have only been campaigning for a short period of time we’ve already received in excess of  million in indicated interest to invest from over  individuals while this is certainly exciting news on the capital front we feel it’s most important because it shows a real connection has been established with our consumers” states dr toomey that connection whether it was made through products the crowdfunding campaign the information they distribute through the marijuana times or through their commitment to satisfying patients is the most important benchmark of success for this team of professionals “these connections and the support they bring show us that we are moving in the right direction with medx and give us hope for our and the industry’s future with your support we can continue to shape a better future for

correct the course of cannabis in america with new insecticidal soil jan    et from medx inc los angeles jan   prnewswire  as of late despite its nagging presence on the federal schedule i substance list cannabis reform has been sweeping the country thirtynine of  states have some sort of cannabis law on the books to legalize the medical side and four states alaska colorado oregon and washington as well as the district of columbia have completely adopted its legalization as those remaining states begin to see the massive tax benefits legalization brings and the medical uses of cannabis are better understood it wont be long until cannabis is rescheduled or outright legalized federally the medical cannabis industry remains one of the least understood and least developed markets out there mostly because of its questionable legality this issue of legality not only touches the sale cultivation and transportation of cannabis but also every part of the medical cannabis industry chain the hurdles surrounding cannabis affect research and development distribution of product cultivation equipment production and even what kind of information about cannabis is accessible to the public clearly this difference in legality state by state causes havoc at every level of the medical cannabis industry but despite its current limitations medical cannabis is still a multibillion dollar industry theres no denying that americans want their cannabis and are willing to support the market even through all of these hurdles but what happens after cannabis has been legalized when the federal government does finally take the step to legalize cannabis there will be a void created as states scramble to handle the quickly budding market at medx inc their management believes the first
