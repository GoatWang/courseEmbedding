taxable bonds generally maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit the trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital the trust is a unit investment trust included in invesco unit trusts taxable income series  monthly distributions  estimated current return  estimated long term return  estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates june   you should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference  the securities and exchange commission has not approved or disapproved of the trust units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus any contrary representation is a criminal offense invesco investment objective the trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of intermediateterm taxable bonds in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o each rated bond must have an investment grade or better rating by at least one credit rating agency with at least a bbb rating by standard  poors or fitch ratings or at least a baa rating by moodys investors service inc or in the case of a bond with no issued ratings such a bond must have credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the trust in the opinion of the sponsor o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk the portfolio generally consists of taxable bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit on the date of deposit certain of the bonds may be rated at least investment grade by one or more credit rating agency yet rated below investment gradeunrated by the others following the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated by one or more credit rating agency or a rating may be reduced even to below investment grade bbb or baa and the trust could continue to hold such bond see trust administrationportfolio administration principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o the financial markets including those for corporate bonds have recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets there can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuers assets or the extent of its obligations for these or other reasons the ratings of the bonds in the trusts portfolio may not accurately reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of the bond o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond o we do not actively manage the trusts portfolio

fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trusts investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trusts portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes interest rates in the united states are at or near historic lows which may increase the trusts exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in particular are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions see taxable municipal bondsbuild america bonds and taxable municipal bondsqualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds below the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereto bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent thereby adversely affecting the trusts net asset value no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange because of the difficulties currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity as a result of such illiquidity the trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your trust are listed under portfolio

its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest all other municipal bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary build america bonds were issued pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local governments to

code apply should a build america bonds issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on the bonds by the code it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments in addition build america bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to sections aa or  of the code as added by the recovery act or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a build america bond issuers borrowing costs qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds collectively qualified bonds are taxable bonds that are similar to certain build america

definition of qualified tax credit bond as found in section a of the code eligible issuers of qualified school construction bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury eligible issuers of qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury should the issuer of a qualified bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the code or other federal laws it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds as provided in section a of the code qualified bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance this mandatory redemption must be completed within  days after such threeyear period unless an extension is granted by the treasury additionally qualified bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any qualified bond issuers borrowing costs certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and

and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic

revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals state risk factors your trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal bonds of issuers from a particular state the financial condition of a state may be affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally limitations imposed by constitutional amendments legislative measures or voter initiatives on a state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of a state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors such as natural disasters complications with exports and industry deregulation a state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations corporate bond industry risks your trust may invest significantly in certain industries any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of these industries before you invest consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the overall state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits global factors including political developments imposition of import controls fluctuations in oil prices and changes in exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and the success of consumer products and services in the marketplace consumer products and services companies may be subject to government regulation affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact performance tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws regulations and litigation financial services issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by banks and other financial services companies in general financial services issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions including the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets interest rates as well as currency and commodities prices investor sentiment inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate competition from new entrants in their fields of business and the overall health of the us and international economies the financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global developments over the last few years including recessionary conditions deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt a substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial institutions with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers into either liquidation or combination this also has drastically increasing the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these problems many of the institutions may continue to experience difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital while the us and foreign governments and their respective government agencies have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps such economic and political conditions and increased public scrutiny during the past few years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the us and abroad creating additional challenges for financial institutions regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services issuers are currently subject thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal costs as well as the potential for higher operational capital and liquidity costs these laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial institution does business and the products and services it may provide increased regulation may restrict a companys ability to compete in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses new regulations may reduce or limit a companys revenue or impose additional fees assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative consequences among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act enacted into federal law on july   the doddfrank act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and issues in the nations evolving financial system it also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes including in areas such as systemic risk regulation overthecounter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection the doddfrank act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come including banks thrifts depository institution holding companies mortgage lenders insurance companies industrial loan companies brokerdealers and other securities and investment advisory firms private equity and hedge funds consumers numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure these regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your trust and could lead to decreases in such issuers profits or revenues in many cases the full impact of the doddfrank act on a financial institutions business remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed the sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation on the securities in your trust or on the financial services industry in general developments in the eurozone sovereign debt crisis including the potential for further downgrades of sovereign credit ratings as well as downgrades to the ratings of the us governments sovereign credit rating could adversely affect financial services issuers in addition the departure of any eurozone country from use of the euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges operations and settlements which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers the financial condition of customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect financial services issuers financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing or other counterparty relationships many of these transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of other counterparty financial institutions economic and market conditions may increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer client or counterparty default downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity cash flows competitive position financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting access to funding or capital markets increasing borrowing costs or triggering increased collateral requirements financial services issuers face significant legal risk both from regulatory investigations and proceedings as well as private actions profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition further economic conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings associations companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally terrorism weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers life and health insurance companies may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates including the effect of epidemics insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability health care issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by health care companies these issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotechnology managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies these companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of  incorporating the patient protection and affordable care act collectively the act was enacted into law the act continues to have a significant impact on the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a complex and ongoing process with varying effective dates significant provisions of the act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most americans significant expansion in the number of americans eligible for medicaid modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families the act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions although the entirety of the act will not come into effect until  in the interim health care companies will face continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and changes in the health care market the sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the act on the securities in your trust as illustrated by the act congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector the proposals may span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs incentives for competition in the provision of health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector the government could also reduce funding for health care related research drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales product obsolescence termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come to market the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial this process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval these companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its stock the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims product liability claims or other litigation health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services the ability of the facility to provide required services an increased emphasis on outpatient services confidence in the facility management capabilities competitive forces that may result in price discounting efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and termination or restriction of government financial assistance such as medicare medicaid or similar programs industrials issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition imposition of import controls volatility in commodity prices currency exchange rate fluctuation consolidation labor relations domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and leverage levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials depletion of resources government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual

insurance costs transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight which may negatively impact their businesses materials issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies in the materials industry companies in the materials sector could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility exchange rates import controls and increased competition production of materials often exceeds demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns leading to poor investment returns companies in the materials sector are at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by depletion of resources technical progress labor relations and governmental regulations telecommunications issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies this sector is primarily characterized by extensive government regulation and intense competition companies in the telecommunications industry allocate significant resources in efforts to comply with applicable government regulations telecommunications companies operating in the us must comply with applicable state and federal regulations including those of the federal communications commission the costs of complying with governmental regulations delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies recent industry consolidation trends may lead to increased regulation in primary markets internationally telecommunications companies may face regulatory challenges such as securing premarketing clearance of products and prices which may be arbitrary and unpredictable us federal and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer us federal legislation governing the telecommunications industry may become subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect certain telecommunications issuers the competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector is intense and constantly evolving the products and services of these companies may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances at the same time demand for some telecommunications services remains weak as several key markets are oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service providers and technology platforms to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines certain telecommunications companies may be engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products and may have higher costs including liabilities associated with the medical pension and postretirement expenses of their workforce than their competitors as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility moreover continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and delay and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing operations and related risks among other factors could result in the failure of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies several highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the telecommunications industry high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s caught up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny moreover some companies have begun the process of emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies remains substantial and may continue to rise information technology issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by information technology companies these companies include companies that are involved in computer and business services enterprise softwaretechnical software internet and computer software internetrelated services networking and telecommunications equipment telecommunications services electronics products server hardware computer hardware and peripherals semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors these companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions an unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company the failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the companys results information technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading announcements about new products technologies operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically at times however extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company this can impact your ability to redeem your units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid energy issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by energy companies energy companies are subject to legislative or regulatory changes adverse market conditions andor increased competition affecting the energy sector the prices of the securities of energy companies may fluctuate widely due to changes in value and dividend yield which depend largely on the price and supply of energy fuels international political events relating to oil producing countries energy conservation the success of exploration projects and tax and other governmental regulatory policies energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional energy reserves the exploration and recovery process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly an energy company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically recoverable the industry also faces substantial government regulation including environmental regulation these regulations have increased costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny in addition energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing regions such as the middle east the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels operating hazards government regulation and the level of consumer demand political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past and appear to change on an ongoing basis political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on your investment oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile opec controls a substantial portion of world oil production opec may take actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil various domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these prices any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on energy companies utility issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by utility companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries many utility companies especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies are subject to various uncertainties including o risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs o restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations o regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer o coping with the general effects of energy conservation o technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete o the effects of unusual unexpected or abnormal local weather o maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors o the potential impact of natural or manmade disasters o difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital even if frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions o the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation o difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities o increased competition and o international politics any of these factors or a combination of these factors could affect the supply of or demand for energy such as electricity or natural gas or water or the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the bonds and the performance of the trust utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level in the united states and many are regulated at the state level as well the value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change this regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers which could hinder the utility companys ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by its creditors against such utility company furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years these utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business these opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return some companies however may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable while regulated providers tend to have regulated returns nonregulated providers returns are not regulated and generally are more volatile these developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those states with nonregulated providers and could impact the shortterm earnings potential of some in this industry these trends have also made shares of some utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their earnings they pay out as dividends certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations litigation the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the effects of natural or manmade disasters in general certain utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their power plant operations increased costs from new or greater regulation of these operations and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control equipment more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also included in the portfolio and notes thereto this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds also since interest on any when as and if issued bonds does not begin accruing to the benefit of unitholders until the date of delivery the trustee may reduce its fee and pay trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same estimated net annual interest income during the first year of the trusts operations as described under summary of essential financial information no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of the prospectus estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment default if any redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account including cash to pay organization costs and accrued interest if any the maximum sales charge for an intermediateterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds organization costs are not included in the public offering price per unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life in years eltr life of your trusts portfolio eltr life years sales charge  less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    and over  the eltr life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a trusts portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating estimated longterm return see estimated current and longterm returns the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market public offering price per unit for example the maximum secondary market sales charge for a trust with an eltr life of  but less than  years would be  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your

amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units as of the opening of business on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the bond market association recommends an early bond market close provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec becomes effective if later the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately from  to  more than the bid price the public offering price per unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day orders received by the sponsor prior to the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the sponsor by the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of receipt orders received by the sponsor after the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the sponsor until after the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of the next determined public offering price per unit provided they are received timely by the sponsor on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the appropriate bid prices or offering prices as described herein a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by your trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  organization costs during the initial offering period part of the public offering price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated costs incurred in establishing your trust these costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to the trust such as the registration statement prospectus trust agreement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when the trust deducts these costs from the trust assets accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid by the bonds semiannually although your trust accrues interest daily because of this your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units you will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your trust and distributed to unitholders if you sell or redeem all or a portion of your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters

interpretations are subject to change and this summary does not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example except as specifically provided below this summary generally does not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity financial institution person who marks to market their units or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your alternative minimum state local or foreign tax consequences depending on the terms of certain bond issuances however some of the bonds in the trust may be exempt from state and local taxes of the state in which such bonds were issued please consult with your tax advisor with respect to any specific state or local tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust additional information on taxes is contained in the information supplement as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as provided in the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable to you after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that specifies your amount of ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year a distribution paid by your trust reduces the trusts net asset value per unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution accordingly a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of units by a unitholder would be subject to income tax even though it may be viewed in substance as a partial return of capital dividends received deduction and qualified dividend income a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock an individual that owns units generally will not be entitled to treat trust distributions as qualified dividend income currently taxed at longterm capital gains rates as it is not expected that trust distributions will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by the trust sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your initial tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally  net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net short term capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is long term if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes in general any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated as capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units in general this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax rules deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income such deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust reports as capital gain dividends and will generally be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions received by a foreign investor attributable to interestrelated dividends of a regulated investment company such as the trust may not be subject to us federal income tax withholding the amount of distributions that may be reported as interestrelated dividends will be limited to the amount of qualified net interest income which is generally the trusts ussource interest income less allocable expenses the foreign account tax compliance act fatca a  withholding tax on your trusts distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless i if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under fatca the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca pursuant to the rules above and the applicability of any intergovernmental agreements between the united states and the relevant foreign country withholding under fatca is required i with respect to distributions from your trust and ii with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of units that occur on or after january   if withholding is required under fatca on a payment related to your units investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction your trust will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under fatca you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances backup withholding by law your trust must withhold as backup withholding a percentage currently  of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding or if the irs instructs your trust to do so investors should consult their tax advisors investors in the trust may be subject to federal state local or foreign taxes in connection with their investment in

the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in  continue to manifest in nearly all the subdivisions of the financial services industry subprime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in  the impact of these losses among traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or combination while drastically increasing the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital in some cases the us government has acted to bail out or provide support to select institutions however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless increased substantially while the us department of the treasury federal reserve board and congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of these steps banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the grammleachbliley act financialservices overhaul legislation allows banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent years allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission the sec and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the prices of the securities of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry

movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture taxable municipal issues certain bonds in a trust may consist of taxable obligations of municipal issuers obligations of municipal issuers can be either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary build america bonds were issued pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local

qualified tax credit bond as found in section a of the code eligible issuers of qualified school construction bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury eligible issuers of qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury should the issuer of a qualified bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the code or other federal laws it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds as provided in section a of the code qualified bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance this mandatory redemption must be completed within  days after such threeyear period unless an extension is granted by the treasury additionally qualified bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any qualified bond issuers borrowing costs certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital

restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds

building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and

from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste

selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest insurance on the bonds insurance has been obtained by the issuer of bonds or by a prior owner of such bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in an insured trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such insured trust see the trustsobjective and bond selection in the prospectus the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such

ratings are based on current information furnished by the obligor or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any credit rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinate obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition aaaan obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nrthis indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy moodys investors service municipal longterm rating scale moodys municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues in the us

financial and nonfinancial corporations sovereigns and insurance companies are generally assigned issuer default ratings idrs idrs opine on an entitys relative vulnerability to default on financial obligations the threshold default risk addressed by the idr is generally that of the financial obligations whose nonpayment would best reflect the uncured failure of that entity as such idrs also address relative vulnerability to bankruptcy administrative receivership or similar concepts although the agency recognizes that issuers may also make preemptive and therefore voluntary use of such mechanisms in aggregate idrs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on the agencys view of their relative vulnerability to default rather than a prediction of a specific percentage likelihood of default for historical information on the default experience of fitchrated issuers please consult the transition and default performance studies available from the fitch ratings website o the ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood over any given time period o the ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuers securities or stock or the likelihood that this value may change o the ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuers securities or stock o the ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an obligation should an issuer default o the ratings do not opine on the suitability of an issuer as a counterparty to trade credit o the ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuers business operational or financial profile other than the agencys opinion on its relative vulnerability to default aaaaaa ratings denote the lowest expectation of default risk they are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events aaaa ratings denote expectations of very low default risk they indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events aa ratings denote expectations of low default risk the capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong this capacity may nevertheless be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings bbbbbb ratings indicate that expectations of default risk are currently low the capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions the modifiers  or  may be appended to a rating to denote
