data analysis or other skills that i wanted to work on but this was expected since pwm is a startup and very operationsfocused right now pwm also lacks structure and direction in some areas since

terms privacy pricing default hubspot blog three reasons to switch from papercut to printwithme posted by chelseamariahstellmach on jul    pm tweet papercut is a wellknown solution in the print software world but does it work well for coworking spaces our analysis and customer interviews show that space managers should be wary of deploying papercut’s enterprise solution papercut was designed for large companies college campuses and law  accounting firms that regularly use client billbacks coworking spaces have a different relationship with their members and therefore require different print management tools and capabilities printwithme can improve on papercut’s functionality in these core areas     member onboarding – papercut requires up to fifteen minutes of onboarding for each new user that’s a lot of on support with printwithme’s driverless solution new members are able to print in seconds with minimal initial setup members simply email their documents to the printer’s printwithme email address     automatic payment integration – papercut requires you to bill manually or purchase a thirdparty payment system more money integrations more problems  printwithme has developed its own proprietary payment system saving spaces from the hassle of setting up a separate payment gateway and the hassle of entering monthly billback line items to members     inventory management – papercut can help track if the toner is low but printwithme takes it a step further and automatically ships supplies such as paper toner this relieves space management of more tedious functions and ensures you’re never out of stock of critical supplies that members need to print we aren’t just a papercut alternative we are a better print solution for coworking spaces want to learn

chelseamariahstellmach on jul    pm tweet coworking has boomed in the last few years to thousands of spaces across the globe some say that coworking offices will soon eclipse your standard corporate  office completely while coworking is changing the workplace printing practices have remained in the dark ages as a startup working in a coworking space we have found solutions for three major issues we have encountered time waste– community managers are busy with a constant stream of new members they often need to explain how to set up their printing system on each device pwm eliminates this user confusion with simple step instructions on the printer itself best of all users do not need to download any software or drivers all they need is a device that connects to the internet and their email we also save you time by managing your device for you whether that means technical support or reordering paper and toner overprinting– some members of your space may abuse their printing privilege especially when it comes to color printing it’s bad for the environment and your bank account pwm allows spaces to set simple user quotas on free printing when they exceed the number of sponsored pages we use an integrated payment system that requires them to pay prior to receiving their documents we don’t think you should waste your energy on billing your members after the fact or depending on the honor system inconvenient device leases– many spaces have found themselves trapped in printer leases they cannot afford but want more functionality and savings we work with spaces to find the best hardware options for them we can rent or sell you one of our  brother models already locked in we have developed technology to use our software with many other printing devices that can still save you thousands per year in toner costs we are committed to your satisfaction and recommend you try using our software on your own device free for a week want to learn more check us out here  comments click here to readwrite comments topics printing coworking in the world of guest printing email is king posted by jonathanpwm on jul    pm tweet when we first starting building printwithme’s guest printing technology we invested much effort in studying our users and their contexts we endeavored to fully understand their particular needs before ever writing a line of code so we spent weeks interviewing customers and examining various existing printing protocols we soon found that most people we spoke with were printing documents that resided on their pclaptop’s hard drive or in the cloud an email account dropbox google drive etc this presented two key takeaways for us that would end up informing the design of our system first we learned that tobeprinted documents do not typically reside in smartphone storage despite the wide proliferation of mobile applications and second documents are becoming increasingly accessed edited and stored exclusively in the cloud without even “touching down to earth” to a user’s local storage in fact google has invested heavily in its everimproving google docs suite of products which now rival the microsoft office suite in usage and do not require any touchdown to local storage to use armed with these fresh learnings we began to evaluate various possible workflows that would allow for the easy transferral of documents from guest user’s devices and clouds to our unique printing system email quickly rose to the front of the pack as the most promising protocol why most of these documents could be easily “exported” from their respective sources via email in only one or two easy steps further everyone has an email account these days and is familiar and comfortable with using it the alternative workflows were not nearly as userfriendly provide a computer terminal paired with the printer disadvantages more steps for the user to complete lack of trust singing into email accounts more hardware to maintain allow the user to find the printer on a local network kicker we can not authenticate the user easily we can not appropriately charge the customer webbased upload kicker while practical for documents on a laptop not practical for emailbased or cloudbased documents while we have plans to build quite a few more interfaces in the future and we already are it was clear to us from very early on why email is the king when it comes to guest printing we hope you would agree  comments click here to readwrite comments topics printing email cloud interesting wifi trends in public places posted by jonathanpwm on jul    am tweet printwithme is now partnered with  businesses in chicago and new york city through the normal course of installing our printing kiosks we have encountered and conquered tons of different wifi environments that range from the excellent to the downright terrible we thought the various “public” cafe wifi setups we have encountered would make for a great blog post so here are some of the things we’ve noticed in the past year sorry no wifi here – a small number of coffee houses are opting to buck the starbucks playbook altogether and not offer wifi thereby purposefully making their coffee venue less of a “third place” and more of a “daily fix” destination the most commonly cited reason is to discourage “camping” in stores – see previous blog post on how removing wifi can backfire on sales – but honestly we see this “nuclear option” almost exclusively in places where real estate is tight like espresso bars and coffee spots in nyc that are shoehorned into cozy storefronts some that are not much wider than a bowling lane the terribly overworked router – a couple of the shops we have installed in unfortunately opted for the lean approach to offering wifi – running it off of a basic homeuse router meant for no more than several connections at once this leads to obvious problems of people getting booted off frequently slow downloadupload speeds and difficulty initially connecting luckily this is becoming exceedingly rare among decent coffee shops as owners want to avoid confrontation from angry guests and many owners see the value in keeping customers around or at least keeping them in the habit of going to their coffee shop for their outofoffice laptop sessions nearlypermanent passwords – one of the more surprising patterns we’ve noticed is that café owners rarely change their public wifi passwords yes they’re aware of the moral hazard they’re permitting — they know that their neighbor jimmy upstairs could easily acquire the password once in the café and then say goodbye to his pricey comcast service but nevertheless they rarely change their public password allowing for unfettered access by neighbors timegated wifi systems – we first saw this in use at birch coffee in new york city a small but growing number of cafés are offering timegated wifi access they do this by printing the wifi key on their receipts allowing users access to wifi for    or minute sessions at a time once the session is up the customer must buy another menu item to renew the wifi sessions this is a smart move by coffee houses who can afford this system and have an otherwise annoying issue with “serial campers” who buy only one item or sometimes no items at all and work in the café all day socialgated wifi access – our friends at socialsignin and several other similar companies are selling café partners on routers that require users to take a social media action to access the wifi network this is a pretty smart product idea though i feel that coffee houses have a hard time quantifying the true value “okay so this program got me like  likes in a year but what does that really get me” café managers who are truly socialmedia savvy can probably leverage these likes for efficient remarketing campaigns – but that’s a rare café manager  comments click here to readwrite comments topics wifi gizmodo explains why consumers dont love

amenity posted by jonathan treble and rhea patel on jul    am tweet due to rapid advancements in mobile computing capabilities the last two decades have witnessed a significant growth in telecommuting practices telecommuting most often refers to working at home but a growing share of telecommuters are conducting work in “third place” environments such as cafés and coffee shops the “third place” is a term made famous by starbuck’s ceo howard shultz who is describing his ubiquitous coffee chain’s ambiance the term connotes a comfortable environment separate from the office and home enjoyed by a range of guests for purposes as diverse as catching up with a friend meeting in a large group studying independently or working remotely the latter two usecases have only recently been made possible by abundant highspeed wifi in coffee houses starbucks for one invested heavily in upgrading its wifi infrastructure two years ago when it partnered with google to bring a faster more reliable version of its free wifi to its stores but wifi isn’t the only amenity that arduous guests desire — in a survey conducted by samsung in   of mobile workers said that they would like to see their café offer printing yes the strong support for printing makes it the secondmost desired amenity right behind wifi it even topped the oldschool newspaper stand tucked in the corner this shift coincides with a shift in decreased printer ownership as millennials increasingly scrutinize the value proposition of owning a clunky piece of hardware that’s expensive to purchase and restock so should coffee houses really offer this amenity does it not make their store feel too much like a “coffice”  at printwithme we have engaged with scores of independent café owners conducted our own user surveys and heard a wide range of perspectives our conclusion is that paidprinting is almost always a worthwhile amenity to offer especially if the shop can efficiently outsource the operation to a thirdparty provider like printwithme the simple condition that needs to be met is that of space availability — so long as two squarefeet in an accessible part of the store can be allocated to the printer then offering the amenity handsomely pays for its space through crosssales indeed the savviest café owners who analyze their traffic trends attribute a significant share of their sales to mobile workers who desire wifi and printing one veteran coffeehouse owner in chicago recently learned the value of wifi the hard way after years of offering it he experimented by disabling his public wifi for  months he quickly did an aboutface after he crunched the numbers and saw the significant dip in sales printwithme’s turnkey print station directly meets the growing desire for the printing amenity in cafés
