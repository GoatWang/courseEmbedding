not be published required website oarsman capital inc  top money managers our philosophy  oarsman capital inc–investment and portfolio management services select page our philosophy essential to attaining superior investment results is steadfast adherence to a disciplined investment philosophy at oarsman capital our approach to managing client assets is founded on sound underlying principles portfolio balance every major asset class eg stocks bonds real estate offers powerful return potential we do not attempt to outguess the market but rather position each portfolio to benefit from performance boosting trends as they occur for equity portfolios in addition to a diversified mix of highquality domestic companies we add other equity classes such as international small cap and emerging market stocks these complementary asset classes enhance performance potential and because they do not move in lockstep with the core portion of the portfolio also help control overall portfolio volatility risk for balanced portfolios eg portfolios designed to balance risk and return we add steady income through bonds andor bond funds as well as adding in other asset categories such as highyield bonds reits and natural resource funds risk control we believe firmly that controlling investment risk is essential to achieving superior longterm results for our clients less volatile investment results also facilitate planning in portfolios that support living expenses or have unpredictable cash flows prudent diversification and commitment to highquality securities are integral to our riskcontrolling approach while portfolio balance a hallmark of oarsman capital is a fundamental method for controlling risk oarsman takes risk control further by focusing on highquality security selection the historical record is clear investments in securities of high fundamental quality have resulted in the highly desirable combination of preserving capital in challenging investment environments while providing substantial appreciation in more supportive periods stocks at oarsman capital our definition of a highquality company is one that is capable of generating consistent earnings and dividend growth highquality companies have excellent management proprietary products solid balance sheets strong returnonequity and more often than not strong international presence bonds we consider fixedincome securities to be the anchor of the portfolio providing a predictable income stream and acting as a cushion against volatility our bond portfolios generally hold average ratings of a or better and have intermediate portfolio durations less than  years other alternativehybrid in addition to stocks and bonds for a much smaller portion of the portfolio up to  in total we often add “hybrid” securities – those investments that are neither stocks nor bonds  this additional diversification category includes highyield bonds inflationprotecting bonds reits and natural resource
