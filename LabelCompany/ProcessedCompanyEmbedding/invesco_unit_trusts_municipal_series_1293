begin with the stocks in the morgan stanley capital international europe australasia and far east index as detailed below one of the most widelyused benchmarks for international investing eliminate stocks traded in singapore to help limit exposure to uncertain political and economic conditions screen the remaining stocks to include only those companies with positive one and threeyear sales and earnings growth and three years of positive dividend growth rank the remaining stocks from the previous step by market capitalization and select the top  from the stocks that remain from the previous step buy the twenty highest dividendyielding stocks and hold them for about one year in the event that a stock in the initial portfolio would result in you and the portfolio being direct or indirect shareholders of any passive foreign investment companies pfics such stock will be replaced with the next highest dividendyielding stock invesco capital markets inc the sponsor implemented the strategy using information available as of the close of business on december   when the portfolio terminates you can elect to follow the strategy by redeeming your units and reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio if available many consider the msci eafesm index to be the premier equity benchmark for global investing the index represents more than  stocks across  developed countries these countries include australia austria belgium denmark finland france germany greece hong kong ireland israel italy japan the netherlands new zealand norway portugal singapore spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom the final step of the strategy replaces pfics because of the negative tax treatment which could result from such ownership a small percentage of the msci eafesm index includes stocks that may be classified as pfics and from time to time the stocks used to calculate hypothetical performance may include a limited number of stocks that are pfics the portfolio is designed as part of a longterm investment strategy the sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current portfolio terminates as a result you may achieve more consistent overall results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are available for more information see rights of unitholdersrollover principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this portfolio the portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period o the portfolios performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the portfolios investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested timing of the portfolio offering or timing of your investment and portfolio expenses o stocks of foreign companies in the portfolio present risks beyond those of us issuers these risks may include market and political factors related to the companys foreign market international trade conditions less regulation smaller or less liquid markets increased volatility differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies o the portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies domiciled in the united kingdom as a result political economic or social developments in the united kingdom may have a significant impact on the securities included in the portfolio o the portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the consumer staples sector negative developments in this sector will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified

perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period o the portfolios performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the portfolios investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the composition andor weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested the timing of the portfolio offering or timing of your investment regulatory restrictions and portfolio expenses o the portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the health care sector negative developments in this sector will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified

commissions paid by a portfolio on the purchase of securities or taxes incurred by unitholders the portfolios are established at different times of the year a portfolio may not be able to invest equally in the securities according to the strategy weightings and may not be fully invested at all times a portfolio may be subject to specific investment exclusions or restrictions the securities are often purchased or sold at prices different from the closing prices used in buying and selling units the stock prices on the strategy implementation date may be different from prices on the initial date of deposit extraordinary market events that are not expected to be repeated and may have affected performance and currency exchange rates will be different in addition both stock prices which may appreciate or depreciate and dividends which may be increased reduced or eliminated will affect actual returns there can be no assurance that any portfolio will outperform the comparison

as supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee the portfolios offer investors the opportunity to purchase units representing proportionate interests in portfolios of equity securities which are components of major stock market indexes a portfolio may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of stocks with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually and who are seeking to achieve a better performance than the related index on the initial date of deposit the sponsor deposited delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase of the securities and an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the trustee in exchange for these contracts the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the portfolios unless otherwise terminated as provided in the trust agreement the portfolios will terminate on the mandatory termination date and any remaining securities will be liquidated or distributed by the trustee within a reasonable time as used in this prospectus the term securities means the securities including contracts to purchase these securities listed in each portfolio and any additional securities deposited into each portfolio additional units of a portfolio may be issued at any time by depositing in the portfolio i additional securities ii contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or iii cash or a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a portfolio the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each unit may be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into a portfolio following the initial date of deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each security in the portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the portfolios will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees due to round lot requirements in certain foreign securities markets and market value fluctuations certain portfolios may not be able to invest in each security on any subsequent date of deposit in the same proportion as existed on the initial date of deposit or immediately prior to the subsequent deposit of securities this could increase the potential for dilution of investments and variances in anticipated income in addition during the initial offering of units it may not be possible to buy a particular security due to regulatory or trading restrictions or corporate actions while such limitations are in effect additional units would be created by purchasing each of the securities in your portfolio that are not subject to those limitations this would also result in the dilution of the investment in any such security not purchased and potential variances in anticipated income purchases and sales of securities by your portfolio may impact the value of the securities this may especially be the case during the initial offering of units upon portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying large unit redemptions each unit of your portfolio initially offered represents an undivided interest in the portfolio at the close of the new york stock exchange on the initial date of deposit the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in your portfolio and the estimated distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in your portfolio represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in your portfolio will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement each portfolio consists of a the

sponsor the portfolio consultant may use the list of securities in its independent capacity as an investment adviser and distributes this information to various individuals and entities the portfolio consultant may recommend or effect transactions in the securities this may have an adverse effect on the prices of the securities this also may have an impact on the price a portfolio pays for the

including the securities and may act as a market maker in the securities the portfolio consultant also issues reports and makes recommendations on the securities the portfolio consultants research department may receive compensation based on commissions generated by research andor sales of units neither the portfolio consultant nor the sponsor manage the portfolios you should note that the portfolio consultant or sponsor applied the selection criteria to the securities for inclusion in the portfolios as of the applicable selection time after this time the securities may no longer meet the selection criteria should a security no longer meet the selection criteria we will generally not remove the security from its portfolio in offering the units to the public neither the sponsor nor any brokerdealers are recommending any of the individual securities but rather the entire pool of securities in a portfolio taken as a whole which are represented by the units risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your portfolio will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your portfolio will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security of the issuer even though your portfolio is supervised you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your portfolio will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund in addition because some portfolios hold relatively small number of stocks you may encounter more price volatility than would occur in an investment diversified among a greater number of stocks dividend payment risk dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay dividends on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time if dividends received by your portfolio are insufficient to cover expenses redemptions or other portfolio costs it may be necessary for your portfolio to sell securities to cover such expenses redemptions or other costs any such sales may result in capital gains or losses to you see taxation strategy correlation each portfolio involves the risk that its performance will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the portfolios investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as o the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact weightings at a given time especially as a result of roundlot trading requirements applicable to certain foreign issuers o strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while the portfolios are created at various times during the year and have  or  month terms o a portfolio may not be fully invested at all times and o fees and expenses of a portfolio in addition the stock selection strategy of a portfolio may not be successful in identifying stocks that appreciate in value or pay significant dividends a portfolio may not achieve its objective if this happens industry risks your portfolio may invest significantly in certain industries any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of these industries before you invest consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers the eafe select  portfolio select sp industrial portfolio dow jones select dividend index strategy portfolio and global  dividend strategy portfolio invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the overall state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits global factors including political developments imposition of import controls fluctuations in oil prices and changes in exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and the success of consumer products and services in the marketplace consumer products and services companies may be subject to government regulation affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact performance tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws regulations and litigation financial services issuers the dow jones select dividend index strategy portfolio and select sp core portfolio invest significantly in banks and other financial services companies in general financial services issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions including the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets interest rates as well as currency and commodities prices investor sentiment inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate competition from new entrants in their fields of business and the overall health of the us and international economies the financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global developments over the last few years including recessionary conditions deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt a substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial institutions with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers into either liquidation or combination this also has drastically increasing the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these problems many of the institutions may continue to experience difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital while the us and foreign governments and their respective government agencies have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps such economic and political conditions and increased public scrutiny during the past few years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the us and abroad creating additional challenges for financial institutions regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services issuers are currently subject thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal costs as well as the potential for higher operational capital and liquidity costs these laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial institution does business and the products and services it may provide increased regulation may restrict a companys ability to compete in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses new regulations may reduce or limit a companys revenue or impose additional fees assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative consequences among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act enacted into federal law on july   the doddfrank act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and issues in the nations evolving financial system it also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes including in areas such as systemic risk regulation overthecounter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection the doddfrank act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come including banks thrifts depository institution holding companies mortgage lenders insurance companies industrial loan companies brokerdealers and other securities and investment advisory firms private equity and hedge funds consumers numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure these regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your portfolio and could lead to decreases in such issuers profits or revenues in many cases the full impact of the doddfrank act on a financial institutions business remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed the sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation on the securities in your portfolio or on the financial services industry in general developments in the eurozone sovereign debt crisis including the potential for further downgrades of sovereign credit ratings as well as downgrades to the ratings of the us governments sovereign credit rating could adversely affect financial services issuers in addition the departure of any eurozone country from use of the euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges operations and settlements which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers the financial condition of customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect financial services issuers financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing or other counterparty relationships many of these transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of other counterparty financial institutions economic and market conditions may increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer client or counterparty default downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity cash flows competitive position financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting access to funding or capital markets increasing borrowing costs or triggering increased collateral requirements financial services issuers face significant legal risk both from regulatory investigations and proceedings as well as private actions profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition further economic conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings associations companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally terrorism weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers life and health insurance companies may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates including the effect of epidemics insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability health care issuers the select  industrial portfolio select  industrial portfolio and select sp core portfolio invest significantly in health care companies these issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotechnology managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies these companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of  incorporating the patient protection and affordable care act collectively the act was enacted into law the act continues to have a significant impact on the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a complex and ongoing process with varying effective dates significant provisions of the act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most americans significant expansion in the number of americans eligible for medicaid modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families the act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions although the entirety of the act will not come into effect until  in the interim health care companies will face continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and changes in the health care market the sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the act on the securities in your portfolio as illustrated by the act congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector the proposals may span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs incentives for competition in the provision of health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector the government could also reduce funding for health care related research drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales product obsolescence termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come to market the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial this process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval these companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its stock the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims product liability claims or other litigation health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services the ability of the facility to provide required services an increased emphasis on outpatient services confidence in the facility management capabilities competitive forces that may result in price discounting efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and termination or restriction of government financial assistance such as medicare medicaid or similar programs industrials issuers the select  industrial portfolio and select sp industrial portfolio invest significantly in industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition imposition of import controls volatility in commodity prices currency exchange rate fluctuation consolidation labor relations domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and leverage levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials depletion of resources government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel the number of housing starts levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment manufacturers stocks of transportation companies are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes fuel prices and insurance costs transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight which may negatively impact their businesses telecommunications issuers the select  industrial portfolio and select  industrial portfolio invest significantly in telecommunications companies this sector is primarily characterized by extensive government regulation and intense competition companies in the telecommunications industry allocate significant resources in efforts to comply with applicable government regulations telecommunications companies operating in the us must comply with applicable state and federal regulations including those of the federal communications commission the costs of complying with governmental regulations delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies recent industry consolidation trends may lead to increased regulation in primary markets internationally telecommunications companies may face regulatory challenges such as securing premarketing clearance of products and prices which may be arbitrary and unpredictable us federal and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer us federal legislation governing the telecommunications industry may become subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect certain telecommunications issuers the competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector is intense and constantly evolving the products and services of these companies may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances at the same time demand for some telecommunications services remains weak as several key markets are oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service providers and technology platforms to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines certain telecommunications companies may be engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products and may have higher costs including liabilities associated with the medical pension and postretirement expenses of their workforce than their competitors as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility moreover continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and delay and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing operations and related risks among other factors could result in the failure of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies several highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the telecommunications industry high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s caught up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny moreover some companies have begun the process of emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies remains substantial and may continue to rise information technology issuers the select  industrial portfolio and select  industrial portfolio invest significantly in information technology companies these companies include companies that are involved in computer and business services enterprise softwaretechnical software internet and computer software internetrelated services networking and telecommunications equipment telecommunications services electronics products server hardware computer hardware and peripherals semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors these companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions an unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company the failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the companys results information technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading announcements about new products technologies operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically at times however extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company this can impact your ability to redeem your units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid utility issuers the dow jones select dividend index strategy portfolio and eafe select  portfolio invest significantly in utility companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries many utility companies especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies are subject to various uncertainties including o risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs o restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations o regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer o coping with the general effects of energy conservation o technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete o the effects of unusual unexpected or abnormal local weather o maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors o the potential impact of natural or manmade disasters o difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital even if frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions o the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation o difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities o increased competition and o international politics any of these factors or a combination of these factors could affect the supply of or demand for energy such as electricity or natural gas or water or the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the securities and the performance of the portfolio utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level in the united states and many are regulated at the state level as well the value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change this regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers which could hinder the utility companys ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by its creditors against such utility company furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years these utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business these opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return some companies however may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable while regulated providers tend to have regulated returns nonregulated providers returns are not regulated and generally are more volatile these developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those states with nonregulated providers and could impact the shortterm earnings potential of some in this industry these trends have also made shares of some utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their earnings they pay out as dividends certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations litigation the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the effects of natural or manmade disasters in general certain utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their power plant operations increased costs from new or greater regulation of these operations and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control equipment foreign stocks because the eafe select  portfolio invests exclusively and the global  dividend strategy portfolio invests significantly in foreign stocks these portfolios involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks these risks include the risk of losses due to future political and economic developments international trade conditions foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for a portfolio to vote proxies exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of a portfolios investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on a portfolios securities certain stocks may be held in the form of american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs or other similar receipts adrs and gdrs represent receipts for foreign common stock deposited with a custodian which may include the trustee the adrs in your portfolio if any trade in the us in us dollars and are registered with the sec gdrs are receipts issued by foreign banks or trust companies or foreign branches of us banks that represent an interest in shares of either a foreign or us corporation these instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted adrs and gdrs generally involve the same types of risks as foreign common stock held directly some adrs and gdrs may experience less liquidity than the underlying common stocks traded in their home market the portfolios may invest in sponsored or unsponsored adrs unlike a sponsored adr where the depositary has an exclusive relationship with the foreign issuer an unsponsored adr may be created by a depositary institution independently and without the cooperation of the foreign issuer consequently information concerning the foreign issuer may be less current or reliable for an unsponsored adr and the price of an unsponsored adr may be more volatile than if it was a sponsored adr depositaries of unsponsored adrs are not required to distribute shareholder communications received from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights to its holders the holders of unsponsored adrs generally bear all the costs associated with establishing the unsponsored adr whereas the foreign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored adr the purchase and sale of the foreign securities may occur in foreign securities markets certain of the factors stated above may make it impossible to buy or sell them in a timely manner or may adversely affect the value received on a sale of securities custody of certain of the securities in a portfolio may be maintained by a global custody and clearing institution which has entered into a subcustodian relationship with the trustee in addition round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets these round lot trading requirements could cause the proportional composition and diversification of a portfolios securities to vary when the portfolio purchases additional securities or sells securities to satisfy expenses or unit redemptions this could have a material impact on investment performance and portfolio composition brokerage commissions and other fees generally are higher for foreign securities government supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets currency markets trading systems and brokers may be less than in the us the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody holding of the portfolios assets also may involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means a portfolio may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices because securities of foreign issuers not listed on a us securities exchange generally pay dividends and trade in foreign currencies the us dollar value of these securities and dividends will vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the us dollar for various economic and political reasons to determine the value of foreign securities or their dividends the trustee will estimate current exchange rates for the relevant currencies based on activity in the various currency exchange markets however these markets can be quite volatile depending on the activity of the large international commercial banks various central banks large multinational corporations speculators and other buyers and sellers of foreign currencies since actual foreign currency transactions may not be instantly reported the exchange rates estimated by the trustee may not reflect the amount a portfolio would receive in us dollars had the trustee sold any particular currency in the market the value of the securities in terms of us dollars and therefore the value of your units will decline if the us dollar decreases in value relative to the value of the currencies in which the securities trade a portfolio may be subject to negative federal income tax consequences if it invests in pfic stock which it is not able to dispose of or in nonpfic stock which later becomes pfic stock due to a change in the percentage of the issuers passivetype income or assets as a result of holding pfic stock a portfolio could be subject to federal income tax including interest charges on certain distributions or dispositions with respect to those investments which cannot be eliminated by making distributions to shareholders elections may be available to such portfolio to mitigate the effect of this tax provided that the pfic complies with certain reporting requirements but such elections generally accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash holding pfic stock could cause a portfolio to currently recognize income it has not yet received which could impact the distribution requirements applicable to any portfolio which is a regulated investment company for tax purposes united kingdom the eafe select  portfolio invests significantly in stocks issued by companies located in the united kingdom uk as a result this portfolio may be affected unfavorably by political developments social instability changes in government policies and other political and economic developments in the uk the uk is a member state of the european union eu the establishment of which has had the effect of eliminating most remaining trade barriers between member nations and has created one of the largest common markets in the world unlike the majority of eu members the uk has not adopted the common eu currency of the euro adoption of the euro has presented strategic challenges to all companies with significant markets or operations in countries utilizing the euro the sponsor cannot predict when or if the uk will convert to the euro or what impact if any the adoption of the euro by the uk would have on any of the securities issued by uk companies in your portfolio legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the portfolios or on the tax treatment of your portfolio or of your investment in a portfolio in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities no fdic guarantee an investment in your portfolio is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency public offering general units are offered at the public offering price which consists of the net asset value per unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in your portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the portfolio divided by the total units outstanding the maximum sales charge equals  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the securities at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy units the initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales charge will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales charge is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as described in the fee table if any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day we will charge the payment on the next business day if you purchase units after the initial deferred sales charge payment you will only pay that portion of the payments not yet collected if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales charge you will pay any remaining deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your units the initial and deferred sales charges are referred to as the transactional sales charge the transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee which compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your portfolio and is described under expenses the creation and development fee is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the creation and development fee as of the close of the initial offering period as described in the fee table if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the creation and development fee you will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your units because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit the actual charges will exceed the percentages shown in the fee table if the public offering price per unit falls below  and will be less than the percentages shown in the fee table if the public offering price per unit exceeds  in no event will the maximum total sales charge exceed  of the public offering price per unit since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any decrease in net asset value however if the public offering price per unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee your initial sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy units in such a situation the value of securities per unit would exceed the public offering price per unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value of those securities will fluctuate which could result in a benefit or detriment to unitholders that purchase units at that price the initial sales charge credit is paid by the sponsor and is not paid by the portfolio the fee table shows the sales charge calculation at a  public offering price per unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below and above  if the public offering price per unit fell to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit which consists of an initial sales charge of  a deferred sales charge of  and a creation and development fee of  if the public offering price per unit rose to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit consisting of an initial sales charge of  a deferred sales charge of  and the creation and development fee of  the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase is  units  units for retirement accounts but may vary by selling firm certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your financial professional of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge you may not combine discounts since the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy units large quantity purchases you can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase the amount of units shown in the table below during the initial offering period the sales charge will be as follows transaction amount sales charge  less than                    or more  except as described below these quantity discount levels apply only to purchases of a single portfolio made by the same person on a single day from a single brokerdealer we apply these sales charges as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase the breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole units will be issued for purposes of achieving these levels you may combine purchases of units of a portfolio offered in this prospectus with purchases of units of any other invescosponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering period which are not already subject to a reduced sales charge including other portfolios offered in this prospectus in addition units purchased in the name of your spouse or children under  living in the same household as you will be deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level the reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing units for a single trust estate including multiple trusts created under a single estate or fiduciary account to be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph all purchases must be made on the same day through a single brokerdealer or selling agent you must inform your brokerdealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge fee

issuer however common stocks do not assure dividend payments and therefore the amount of future dividend income to your portfolio is uncertain the actual net annual distributions may decrease over

pay regular fees and expenses during a portfolios life dividend and income conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividendsincome paid or declared over several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions the actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in a portfolios fees and expenses in actual income received by a portfolio currency fluctuations and with changes in a portfolio such as the acquisition call

your portfolio may be taxed under current law at the capital gains tax rates for taxable years beginning before january   certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your portfolio from certain corporations may be reported by the portfolio as being eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate unitholders provided certain holding period requirements are met under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the portfolio may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals in addition your portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units the tax status of your distributions from your portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your portfolio that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year a distribution paid by your portfolio reduces the portfolios net asset value per unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution accordingly a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of units by a unitholder would represent in substance a partial return of capital even though it would be subject to income taxes sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your initial tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally  zero for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods as of the date of this prospectus the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gains for individuals is scheduled to be   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets if the gain is earned on property with a holding period of more than five years the longterm capital gain rate of  currently is scheduled to be reduced to  and the  rate reduced to  net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your portfolio and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code of  as amended the code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations in certain circumstances ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your portfolio may be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the portfolio itself these special rules relating to the taxation of qualified dividend income from regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   your portfolio will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as qualified dividend income which is eligible for the new capital gains tax rates in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an in kind distribution of portfolio securities when you redeem your units in general this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted rollovers and exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your portfolio rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and in general any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss deductibility of portfolio expenses generally expenses incurred by your portfolio will be deducted from the gross income received by your portfolio and only your share of your portfolios net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your portfolio are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your portfolio will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of your portfolios taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions to you from your portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which a portfolio reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income

an item showing foreign taxes your portfolio paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your portfolio paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes if your portfolio meets certain requirements for passing through such deductions or credits to you backup withholding by law your portfolio must withhold as backup withholding a percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding or if the irs instructs your portfolio to do so investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the federal state local and foreign tax consequences of investing in a portfolio taxation  all other portfolios this section summarizes some of the principal us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a portfolio as of the date

not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your portfolio as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the portfolio each portfolio is expected to hold shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes certain portfolios may also hold shares of stock in corporations that qualify as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes reit shares it is

times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the portfolio and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the portfolio will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the portfolio assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each portfolio asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the portfolio assets this tax treatment applies even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from portfolio assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or portfolio expenses your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units disposed of from your proceeds received in the transaction you also generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if your portfolio disposes of portfolio assets your initial tax basis in each portfolio asset is determined by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the portfolio assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however your tax basis in certain portfolio assets must be adjusted after you acquire your units if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain currently is generally  zero for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax

units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the code including generally a maximum deduction against ordinary income of  per year dividends from stocks under current law certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied these are generally referred to as qualified dividends these special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   dividends from reit shares some dividends on the reit shares may be designated as capital gain dividends generally taxable to you as longterm capital gains if you hold a unit for six months or less or if your portfolio holds a reit share for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such reit share will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed to have been received with respect to such reit share distributions of income or capital gains declared on the reit shares in october november or december will be deemed to have been paid to you on december  of the year they are declared even when paid by the reit during the following january other dividends on the reit shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income dividends received deduction generally a domestic corporation owning units in a portfolio may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to such unitholders pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the portfolio however a corporation generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends from most foreign corporations cash distributions rollovers and exchanges if you receive cash when you redeem your units or at your portfolios termination or if you elect to direct that the cash proceeds you are deemed to receive when you redeem your units or at your portfolios termination be rolled into a future trust it is

distribution you will receive portfolio assets plus possibly cash you generally will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole portfolio assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same portfolio assets held by your portfolio however if you also receive cash in exchange for a portfolio asset or a fractional portion of a portfolio asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such portfolio asset or fractional portion limitations on the deductibility of portfolio expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your portfolios income even if some of that income is used to pay portfolio expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your portfolio to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your portfolio as

prospectus table of contents page risk factors  the indexes  sponsor information  trustee information  taxation  portfolio termination  invesco risk factors price volatility because the portfolios invest in stocks of us and foreign companies you should understand the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks and therefore units will fall stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in a portfolio and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of a portfolio will be positive over any period of time because the portfolios are unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some portfolios hold a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock foreign stocks because certain portfolios invest in foreign stocks these portfolios involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in domestic securities there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar to those that are published about issuers in the united states also foreign issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to united states issuers with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation nationalization or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets of a portfolio political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect united states investments in those countries moreover industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in terms of growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the united states while growing in volume they usually have substantially less volume than the new york stock exchange and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable united states issuers fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on united states exchanges there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed issuers than in the united states foreign currencies certain portfolios also involve the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the stocks for example if a foreign stock rose  in price but the us dollar gained  against the related foreign currency a us investors return would be reduced to about  this is because the foreign currency would buy fewer dollars or conversely a dollar would buy more of the foreign currency many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely against the us dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency investor perceptions of world or country economies political instability currency speculation by institutional investors changes in government policies buying and selling of currencies by central banks of countries trade balances and changes in interest rates a portfolios foreign currency transactions will be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as principals on a spot ie cash buying basis these dealers realize a profit based on the difference between the price at which they buy the currency bid price and the price at which they sell the currency offer price the trustee will estimate the currency exchange rates based on current activity in the related currency exchange markets however due to the volatility of the markets and other factors the estimated rates may not be indicative of the rate a portfolio might obtain had the trustee sold the currency in the market at that time consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers certain portfolios may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services issuers an investment in units of certain portfolios should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank and financial services sector in general the effects of the global financial crisis that began to unfold in  continue to manifest in nearly all the subdivisions of the financial services industry financial losses and write downs among investment banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in  the impact of these losses among traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or combination while drastically increasing the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital in some cases us and foreign governments have acted to bail out or provide support to select institutions however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless increased substantially while the us and foreign governments and their respective government agencies have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of these steps banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in the past to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws the impact of these laws on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in your portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the grammleachbliley act financial services overhaul legislation allows banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors and permits new entrants to offer various financial products this legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks legislation to liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law under the legislation banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state one year after the legislations enactment since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in your portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit the sponsor makes no prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the your portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions the sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture utility issuers an investment in units of certain portfolios should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the risks which such an investment may entail general problems of the public utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the public service commissions having jurisdiction the difficulty in financing large construction programs during an inflationary period the restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental nuclear safety and other regulatory considerations the difficulty of the capital markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities the difficulty in obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices unusual unexpected or normal weather and its effects regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer and the effects of energy conservation there is no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating and other expenses and debt service requirements all of the public utilities which are issuers of the securities have been experiencing many of these problems in varying degrees furthermore utility stocks are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk generally exhibiting an inverse relationship to interest rates as a result electric utility stock prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers accordingly a decline in demand for products or technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which for example establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base which must be approved by the state commissions certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time in persuading regulators who are subject to political pressures to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance in addition gas pipeline and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies enforcing or being required to comply with longterm contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers on the one hand or suppliers on the other furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years these utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business these opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return some companies however may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable certain of the issuers of the securities may own or operate nuclear generating facilities governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional requirements governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants in the past nuclear generating projects in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases construction delays and licensing difficulties these have been caused by various factors including inflation high financing costs required design changes and rework allegedly faulty construction objections by groups and governmental officials limits on the ability to obtain financing reduced forecasts of energy requirements and economic conditions this experience indicates that the risk of significant cost increases delays and licensing difficulties remain present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear project also nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval to return to service a major accident at a nuclear plant anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation construction or licensing of nuclear units in view of the uncertainties discussed above there can be no assurance that any utility companys share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units the likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described above varies as does the potential severity of any adverse impact it should be recognized however that one or more of such adverse events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a companys financial condition the results of its operations its ability to make interest and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends other general problems of the electric gas and water utility industries including state and local joint action power agencies include rising costs of rail transportation to transport fossil fuels the uncertainty of transmission service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions changes in tax laws which adversely affect a utilitys ability to operate profitably increased competition in service costs recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations uncertain availability and increased cost of capital unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal availability and cost of natural gas for resale technical and cost factors and other problems associated with construction licensing regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive wastes and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of any securities to make dividend payments and the value of such securities on redemption of your units liquidity whether or not the stocks in a portfolio are listed on a stock exchange the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks we cannot guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid the value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent additional units the sponsor may create additional units of a portfolio by depositing into the portfolio additional stocks or cash with instructions to purchase additional stocks a deposit could result in a dilution of your investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and because the portfolio will pay brokerage or acquisition fees voting only the trustee may sell or vote the stocks in a portfolio while you may sell or redeem your units you may not sell or vote the stocks in your portfolio the sponsor will instruct the trustee how to vote the stocks the trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders if the sponsor fails to provide

with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of portfolio units as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state locality nonus country or other taxing jurisdiction this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your portfolio the global  dividend strategy portfolio intends to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that each will not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders to qualify for the favorable us federal income tax treatment generally accorded to regulated investment companies your portfolio must among other things a derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from qualified publicly traded partnerships b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the market value of the portfolios assets is represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the portfolios total assets and not greater than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or two or more issuers which the

capital losses but excludes net capital gain if any and at least  of its net taxexempt interest income if any each taxable year as a regulated investment company your portfolio generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code but without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any that it distributes to unitholders your portfolio intends to distribute to its unitholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain if your portfolio retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax unless generally your portfolio distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  of the calendar year and  any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those years to prevent application of the excise tax your portfolio intends to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement further if your portfolio retains any net capital gain your portfolio may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who if subject to federal income tax on longterm capital gains i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the portfolio against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by your portfolio in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the portfolio during january of the following calendar year these distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received if a portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed to satisfy the  distribution requirement in any taxable year the portfolio would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income even if such income were distributed to its unitholders and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxable to unitholders as ordinary dividend income your portfolio may be required to withhold as backup withholding federal income tax at the backup withholding rate currently  on all taxable distributions payable to you if you fail to provide your correct taxpayer identification number or to make required certifications or if the irs indicates that you are subject to backup withholding

income whether or not such income is distributed if a portfolio holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the portfolio could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders a portfolio will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes a portfolio may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case a portfolio would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election a portfolio might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax described above dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income portfolio termination a portfolio may be liquidated at any time by consent of unitholders representing   of the units of such portfolio then outstanding or by the trustee when the value of the securities owned by a portfolio as shown by any evaluation is less than   if the value of the portfolio has exceeded  a portfolio will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units of such portfolio not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor so that the net worth of such portfolio would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in such portfolio if a portfolio is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the sponsor the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser the trust agreement will terminate upon the sale or other disposition of the last security held thereunder but in no event will it continue beyond the mandatory termination date commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to and no later than the mandatory termination date securities will begin to be sold in connection with the termination of the portfolios the sponsor will determine the manner timing and execution of the sales of the securities the sponsor shall direct the liquidation of the securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly sales and a minimal market impact in the event the sponsor does not so direct the securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as the trustee in its sole discretion shall determine unitholders who do not elect the rollover option will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining securities within a reasonable time following the mandatory termination date the trustee will deduct from the funds of the appropriate portfolio any accrued costs expenses advances or indemnities provided by the trust agreement including estimated compensation of the trustee costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges any sale of securities in a portfolio upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time the trustee will then distribute to each unitholder of each portfolio his pro rata share of the balance of the income and capital accounts of such portfolio the sponsor may but is not obligated to offer for sale units of a subsequent series of the portfolios pursuant to the rollover option there is however no assurance that units of any new series of the portfolios will be offered for sale at that time or if offered that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the requests of any or all unitholders within  days of the final distribution unitholders will be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount distributable at such time as the trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it will make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner uemssup contents of registration statement this amendment of the registration statement comprises the following papers and documents the facing sheet of form s the

each trust under the grantor trust rules of sections  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code a taxable event will generally occur with respect to each unitholder when a trust disposes of a security whether by sale exchange or redemption or upon the sale exchange or redemption of units by such unitholder a unitholder should determine its tax cost for each security represented by its units by allocating the total cost for its units including the sales charge among the securities in the trust in which it holds units in proportion to the fair market values of those securities on the date the unitholder purchases its units  a unitholder will be considered to have received all of the dividends paid on its pro rata portion of each security when such dividends are received by a trust even if the unitholder does not actually receive such distributions in the year received by the trust including if the unitholder reinvests its dividend distributions pursuant to the reinvestment plan an individual unitholder who itemizes deductions will be entitled to deduct its pro rata share of fees and expenses paid by the trust but only to the extent that this amount together with the unitholders other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds  of its adjusted gross income the deduction of fees and expenses is subject to limitations for individuals with incomes in excess of certain thresholds  under the income tax laws of the state and city of new york each trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and is not subject to the new york franchise tax on business corporations or the new york city general corporation tax for a unitholder who is a new york resident however a pro rata portion of the income of each trust will be treated as income of the unitholder under the income tax laws of the state and city of new york similar treatment may apply in other states our opinion is based on the code the new york state tax law the administrative code of the city of new york the regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant authorities and law all as in effect on the date hereof consequently future changes in such law the regulations promulgated
