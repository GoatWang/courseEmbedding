font size print superior court of pennsylvania deborah l kozel appellee v david f kozel appellant no  wda      decided july   before bender pje lazarus j and mundy j david f kozel husband appeals from the order of the court of common pleas of allegheny county denying his motion for summary judgment which permitted deborah l kozel wife to go forward with her petition for special relief seeking imposition of a constructive trust after careful review we affirmthe trial court summarized the underlying facts and procedural history of the case as followsthe parties were married on july   separated on september   and were divorced by final decree on april   master gary gilman held a nineday hearing on the issues of equitable distribution alimony counsel fees and contempt in late  and early  master gilman issued findings of fact regarding equitable distribution alimony counsel fees and contempt on may   “findings” wifes exceptions and husbands crossexceptions were dismissed and husbands exceptions were granted in part wife then appealed and husband crossappealed to the pennsylvania superior courtthe superior court affirmed the courts ruling on november  on november   wife presented a petition asserting section d of the divorce code  pacs § d which requires that if “a party fails to disclose information required by general rule of the supreme court and in consequence thereof an asset or assets with a fair market value of  or more is omitted from the final distribution of property ․ the court shall grant the petition for imposition of a constructive trust upon a finding of a failure to disclose the assets as required by general rule of the supreme court” wifes petition claims that husband failed to disclose his legal or equitable ownership in certain assets and the husbands alleged nondisclosures necessitate the imposition of a constructive trust as to the following assetsa falcon partnersb gulf keystone petroleum ltd gpk llc gulf keystone and related entitiesc other gas interestswells and partnerships andd other assets of which wife has at this time no knowledge but as to which she will conduct discovery in this matter see wifes petition paragraph husband filed a motion for summary judgment dated december   claiming that wifes action is barred by the statute of limitations of section  of the divorce code  pacs §  opening or vacating decrees which requires that any action claiming intrinsic fraud be filed within  days of the divorce decree and any action claiming extrinsic fraud be filed within  years of the final decreetrial court opinion  at – the trial court denied husbands motion for summary judgment by order dated february   shortly thereafter husband filed a motion to amend the order to state that it involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter see  pacs § b the court issued an order to this effect on march   husband filed a timely notice of appeal on march   and by order dated april   this court granted husbands petition for permission to appeal husband raises the following issues for our review whether an action brought under the constructive trust provision of the divorce code  pacs § d seven years after the final equitable distribution order based solely on allegations of fraud is barred by the statute of limitations provision of the divorce code  pacs §  related to fraud claims whether the trial court erred in not granting husbands motion for summary judgment where there was no genuine issue of material fact that husbands interest in falcon partners was fully disclosed in discovery and included in the order of equitable distribution whether the trial court erred in not granting husbands motion for summary judgment where there was no genuine issue of material fact that gulf keystone petroleum ltd or gpk llc did not exist at the time of the marriage whether the trial court erred in not granting husbands motion for summary judgment where there was no genuine issue of material fact that husbands interest in numerous gas well interests and partnerships was fully disclosed in discovery and included in the order of equitable distribution whether the trial court erred in not granting husbands motion for summary judgment where wife failed to state a cause of action for imposition of a constructive trust on “other assets of husband of which wife has no knowledge”brief of appellant at –wife filed her petition for special relief based on section  of the divorce code which provides in relevant part§  disposition of property to defeat obligationsd constructive trusts for undisclosed assets—if a party fails to disclose information required by general rule of the supreme court and in consequence thereof an asset or assets with a fair market value of  or more is omitted from the final distribution of property the party aggrieved by the nondisclosure may at any time petition the court granting the award to declare the creation of a constructive trust as to all undisclosed assets for the benefit of the parties and their minor or dependent children if any the party in whose name the assets are held shall be declared the constructive trustee unless the court designates a different trustee and the trust may include any terms and conditions the court may determine the court shall grant the petition upon a finding of a failure to disclose the assets as required by general rule of the supreme court pacs § dwife asserts that her allegations of husbands failure to disclose his ownership of certain property brings her petition for constructive trust within section  which provides for the filing of such petition “at any time” husband disagrees and argues that the relief wife seeks is controlled by section  of the divorce code which provides§  opening or vacating decreesa motion to open a decree of divorce or annulment may be made only within the period limited by  pacs §  relating to modification of orders and not thereafter the motion may lie where it is alleged that the decree was procured by intrinsic fraud or that there is new evidence relating to the cause of action which will sustain the attack upon its validity a motion to vacate a decree or strike a judgment alleged to be void because of extrinsic fraud lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or a fatal defect apparent upon the face of the record must be made within five years after the entry of the final decree intrinsic fraud relates to a matter adjudicated by the judgment including perjury and false testimony whereas extrinsic fraud relates to matters collateral to the judgment which have the consequence of precluding a fair hearing or presentation of one side of the case pacs § initially we note that wife does not seek to vacate the divorce decree which is the relief provided under section  rather she seeks a constructive trust which is the relief provided under section  major v major  ad  pasuper supports the proposition that section  is an alternative and distinct cause of action to section  in major wife sought relief under the predecessor to section  seeking to reopen equitable distribution because husband had failed to mention his pension benefits “in previous court records” id at  this court held that wife was not entitled to relief under the predecessor to section  “because  she did not petition for reopening within  days  she has not argued that fraud was perpetrated and  she presents no new evidence relating to the cause of action” id at  nevertheless this court held that the appropriate remedy was a constructive trust under the predecessor to section  we noted that “this remedy cannot be waived by a failure to file exceptions it becomes available ‘at any time’ a court of competent jurisdiction is presented with facts warranting its imposition” id at importantly the facts warranting imposition of a constructive trust “do not include a requirement that the failure to disclose an asset be a deliberate or intentional effort to avoid subjecting funds to the equitable distribution process” creeks v creeks  ad   pasuper the intent of the party who fails to disclose the assets is of no moment idhusband relies on hassick v hassick  ad  pasuper in support of his position that even if wifes allegations are true she is not entitled to relief we disagree because significant distinctions exist between the instant matter and hassick where fourteen years after the parties executed a property settlement agreement wife filed a petition for special relief alleging that her husband fraudulently concealed a pension after holding hearings the trial court “discounted the presence of fraud” id at  but relied on major creeks and section  to grant wife a fifty percent interest in the pension and imposed a constructive trust until the pension reached pay status on appeal this court reversed in part because majors and creeks did not involve allegations of fraud and in part because an excessive period of time had passed between the final decree and the petition for relief the court further noted that relief was only available under section d if a party had failed to disclose information regarding the identity and value of property owned in an “inventory and appraisment” as was then required by section b because neither party in hassick filed an “inventory and appraisment” no relief could be granted in the form of a constructive trust in summary hassick is not a section d case and accordingly it cannot serve as a basis for denying wife the opportunity to seek relief under section dhusband further argues that sections  and  should be read in pari materia pursuant to section  of the statutory construction act  pacs §  however our supreme court has noted that like “all other rules of statutory construction the necessity of applying the rule as to the construction of statutes in pari materia exists only where the terms of the statute to be construed are ambiguous” oliver v city of pittsburgh  ad   pa citing amjurd statutes §  “when the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit”  pacs § c here the language of section  is unambiguous when a party fails to disclose information required by a general rule of the supreme court such as the rules of civil procedure governing identification and valuation of assets and as a result of the nondisclosure an asset with a fair market value of  or more is omitted from the final distribution the aggrieved party may “at any time petition the court granting the award to declare the creation of a constructive trust as to all undisclosed assets”  pacs § d emphasis added accordingly the plain language of section d compels us to reject husbands position that it must be read in pari materia with section  oliver suprahaving concluded that wife properly sought relief under section d we consider husbands claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion for summary judgmentour standard of review of an order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment is wellsettledwe view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and it is clear that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law will summary judgment be entered our scope of review of a trial courts order granting or denying summary judgment is plenary and our standard of review is clear the trial courts order will be reversed only where it is established that the court committed an error of law or abused its discretiondaley v aw chesterton inc  ad   pa citation omittedparcp  governing motions for summary judgment providesafter the relevant pleadings are closed but within such time as not to unreasonably delay trial any party may move for summary judgment in whole or in part as a matter of law whenever there is no genuine issue of any material fact as to a necessary element of the cause of action or defense which could be established by additional discovery or expert report or if after the completion of discovery relevant to the motion including the production of expert reports an adverse party who will bear the burden of proof at trial has failed to produce evidence of facts essential to the cause of action or defense which in a jury trial would require the issues to be submitted to a juryparcp here the trial court determined there are genuine issues of material fact that require discovery and therefore it denied husbands motion for summary judgmentwith respect to the existence of disputed material facts regarding husbands disclosure of his interest in falcon partners we rely on the trial court which notedthe master found that husband transferred his interest in  to his brothers for no consideration see masters report and recommendations p  footnote  the master found that husband and his brother todd kozel took part in “divorce planning” and attributed to this asset forty–six thousand eight hundred eight dollars  based on the assertion by husband that he did not have current or ongoing interest in the asset see id paragraphs – pp – wife claims that shortly after the entry of the final trial court order of september   disposing of the exceptions and cross–exceptions ․ todd kozel reconveyed husbands same interest in falcon to an entity called pioneer i associates trust a trust of which husband is the beneficiary see wifes petition paragraph  wife asserts that the “divorce planning” included a phase ii by which todd would hold the asset for husbands benefit until husbands divorce litigation was concluded this would provide husband all of the rights and benefits of actual ownership in the interim and todd would then convey falcon to husband as soon as his divorce was concluded see wifes petition this court acted within its discretion in determining that an issue of genuine material fact exists with regard to both falcon partners value and any divorce planning these are issues for discovery in accordance with the standard for summary judgment set forth in parcp trial court opinion  at –in her petition wife avers that prior to separation on september   and afterward husband had a legal andor equitable ownership interest in gulf keystone and related entities that he failed to disclose see wifes petition ¶  in support of this claim she attaches to her petition a signed declaration by husbands brother robert kozel in which he states that gulf keystone was established in approximately  however husband asserts that he could not have had such an interest because gulf keystone did not exist until january  see motion for summary judgment at paragraph  even assuming this to be true husband obtained his interest five years prior to the parties equitable distribution trial and therefore had an affirmative duty to disclose this interest see parcp accordingly the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in finding there were genuine issues of material fact that need to be determined through additional discoverywife also sought relief on the basis that husband may have owned more gas wells and related interests than he disclosed in his inventory marital asset summary and pretrial statement see wifes petition ¶¶ – she based her claim on averments in a lawsuit for specific performance filed against husbands brother todd and his wife in the complaint the unrelated plaintiffs aver that on april   husband and his brothers agreed to sell approximately  natural gas wells id based on this information wife has established a genuine issue of material fact as to when husband acquired his interest in these assets furthermore even if the sale of these assets was completed on april   it occurred before the equitable distribution hearing and thus should have been disclosed pursuant to parcp a “general rule of the supreme court” under section d accordingly the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying summary judgment based on husbands assertion that he disclosed all his interests in natural gas wellshusbands final claim is that the trial court abused its discretion by not granting his motion for summary judgment where wife failed to state a cause of action for a constructive trust on assets not otherwise specified if wife had simply sought a constructive trust on unspecified assets we might have been persuaded by husbands contention that wife was on a “fishing expedition” appellants brief at  however in light of the specificity of wifes other allegations regarding failure to disclose assets and the masters finding that husband engaged in divorce planning the trial court did not err as a matter of law or abuse its discretion in denying summary judgment thus allowing the parties to engage in discoveryorder affirmedfootnotes  on december   husband filed an answer and new matter to wifes petition for special relief raising substantially the same issues that he raised in his motion for summary judgment  the order docketed at  wdm

follow us newsbusinessbusiness analysis  features kozel vs kozel a certain mystique surrounds tough american businessman todd kozel but a m divorce battle has laid bare many of the affairs of his complex oil business mark leftly reports saturday  april   bst click to followthe independent online todd kozel is said to be one tough americanthere are stories of how shortly after the fall of the saddam hussein regime the onetime georgecheney campaign contributor marched into the deserts of northern iraq to negotiate huge oil deals with kalashnikovwielding kurds mr kozel didnt blink true or not he gained a certain mystique from such tales his kurdistanfocused company gulf keystone petroleum gkp has fascinated the city and shares have surged on some of the most extraordinary finds the oil market has seen in years just this month the estimated oil reserve of gkps shaikhan discovery went up more than  per cent to bn barrels this is a conservative measure but still makes the find a massive worldclass asset gkp is now worth more than £bn making it one of the biggest companies on the junior aim market and a likely contender for promotion to the main board of the stock exchange one day the company at which mr kozel is both executive chairman and chief executive could be an oil major but the company has occasionally frustrated as much as it has wowed there have been questions over the identities of certain partners while advisers are known to have told gkp that it should provide the market with more information over several issues including details of trusts that hold significant stock this has led to several clashes the reason rbc capital markets stopped acting as broker in autumn  was due to poor communication and personality clashes according to an industry source jeremy asher a nonexecutive director is understood to have left last april as he was angered by the lucrative remuneration awards that executives were receiving if only the critics had known it much of the information they wanted has been publicly available for months in a florida courthouse since august swathes of motions and testimony related to a m divorce fight have been placed with the sarasota circuit court which is a shame because they make for a riproaring read theres a lithuanian mistress a socialite wife strip clubs some of the worlds most glamorous bars and restaurants extraordinary shopping bills lawyers who have represented the worlds greatest golfers and of course one tough american juicy though the details of this divorce might be the cases importance is that it is slowly shedding light on the ownership structures of those trusts and the way that gkp goes about its business the socialite and the mistress ashley kozel started divorce proceedings against her husband last august after  years of marriage she is represented by jeff fisher who clearly likes to hit the fairways he previously acted for greg norman in a divorce that cost the former world numberone golfer a reported m mr fisher is also thought to have at least given advice to tiger woods in his wellpublicised divorce another attorney at his palm beachbased firm fisher  bendeck once defended a newspaper in a defamation case brought by the highspending golfing star john daly mrs kozel seems to be something of a fixture at sarasotas grandest events and last year she was photographed attending a gala dinner that raised  for the conservation foundation of the gulf coast mr kozel meanwhile was spending much of his time in europe building up gkp the couple lived separately and grew apart he is now in a relationship with a lithuanian woman in her mids called anna according to his deposition mr kozel lavishes gifts on his girlfriend in october  alone he spent  at some of milans top fashion houses including prada and versace this spending mrs kozels lawyers claim is just one example of marital waste – money spent of which she argues she is still entitled to half the couple have assets that can be easily valued and divided such as properties three jet skis and a wine collection worth more than  what are more difficult to value are mr kozels business assets in total mrs kozel is fighting for m and is demanding extensive records of trusts and shareholdings that her husbands team argue are already in the public domain us companies that mr kozel has or had interests in – texas keystone tki falcon drilling and falcon partners fp – are named as defendants in one motion tki and fp say of the information requests this is a proverbial fishing expedition for example husband as a shareholder in tki has a very limited right to review corporate documents but the dispute that really catches the eye is over trusts related to gkp a question of trusts mrs kozels legal team claims her husband has been squirrelling away assets in trusts as divorce planning so that she will not be able to get hold of some of his fortune they describe these trusts as mr kozels alter egos gulf keystone petroleum llc gkp llc owns  per cent of gkps stock the named shareholders of llc are mr kozel and ali alqabandi the business development director at gkp mrs kozel alleges that her husband owns between  and  per cent of gkp llc worth up to m depending on how the shares are performing however mr kozel says that although he is named as owning  per cent the majority of that stake is held on behalf of his father and brothers the gokana trust is gkps eighthbiggest shareholder with just shy of  per cent of the stock mrs kozels legal team allege in one motion that this is a trust with m of marital assets in it jerseybased gokana was once called emerald gokanas trustee is called emeralp this seems to have confused all parties with emerald and emeralp often used interchangeably mrs kozels team argues that mr kozel used gokana to place the m beyond the jurisdiction of this court the husband put the money there the lawyers allege because jersey is a notorious asset protection jurisdiction where mrs kozel would struggle to get any of the money that a judge might eventually decide she is owed in april  mr kozel transferred  million shares to what was then emerald in a move described as by way of gift and as part of advised estate planning it has emerged that the controlling shareholder of emeralp the trustee is markus hugelshofer mr kozels swiss lawyer a second tranche of shares transferred in august  has caused quite a stir mr kozel lent mr hugelshofer nearly £m to buy m shares on behalf of gokana as part of a fundraising the proceeds of which were to be used to explore and drill in kurdistan an unfortunate phrasing in mr kozels deposition though means that mrs kozels team argues that the transfer was of questionable legality and that the loan was made during a time when they say that he was not allowed to trade shares fisher how did you lend money to the gokana trust kozel when we did the fundraising in july of  we approached all of our top shareholders and it would be just not me it would be the board of directors finance director chief operating officer legal maybe not so much approached all of them trying – you know do you want to protect your dilution  the other directors approached gokana to see if they wanted to participate gokana did markus made the decision asked me if i would loan money for them to participate he believed in me i loaned him money thats where the loans are coming back from that was a board approach and todd kozel referring to himself in the third person excluded himself in the file mr fisher has highlighted the legal maybe not so much phrase however this was not some sort of admission of guilt it is understood that mr kozel was in fact saying that gkps inhouse legal team did not approach shareholders over the fundraising expenses at least that exchange between mr fisher and mr kozel which took place in december was civil it appears that there was great hostility between the two their showdown dripping with bitter sarcasm at one point mr fisher was asking about a number of credit card bills including  spent on food and drinks at the fivestar hotel de paris in monaco fisher well we dont have time to go through all of these charges but we will another day kozel im looking forward to it fisher i am too i am too well find time and make – you know what if we could – if we could maybe do it at some of these nice restaurants it will make it less – less painful kozel thats not possible im too busy trying to make money fisher well after spending all this money youd better work hard kozel well youre arguing over a whole bunch of gulf keystone thats responsible for this my friend mr kozels deposition also revealed that he regularly entertains customers and company members at a number of strip clubs which are put through gkps expenses these include the windmill international in london and the bourse restaurant in zurich questioned about one stripclub bill that came to more than  mr kozel replied when we do it we take a lot of people and do it properly the deposition also teases out some detail on the etamic trust in  this group was granted a  per cent stake in gkps main operational vehicle and little information was given about the identities of those behind etamic except that it was a beirut investment fund there was press speculation that gulf keystone directors could even be involved though this was denied last year gkp bought etamic out of the jointventure for m after the middle eastern group missed some of its payments when questioned mr kozel makes clear that he was in no way related to etamic as some had speculated and said that the trustees were two bankers in beirut he also told the court that his lawyer mr hugelshofer had helped the bankers establish etamic excalibur mr kozel currently has an asset injunction placed against him this means that he is unable to trade any of his gkp shares which account for  per cent of the company his lawyers have argued that he would not sell up anyway as that would give the wrong signals to the market that he was not confident that the stock price would continue to rise gkp has not announced this restriction and there is no need to under aim rules however together with the stock of gkp llc and gokana nearly  per cent of the companys shares have been affected by this divorce and there is a feeling that the divorce will not be finalised this year which is not what gkp needs when it is already involved in another ugly legal case in new york and london a us company called excalibur ventures is trying to claim up to  per cent of gkps interests in kurdistan gkp has argued that this claim is spurious as it relates to an old deal excalibur had with kozels family company tki not gkp again then there might be confusion over just how all these various companies are interrelated kozel vs kozel should eventually establish just how the tough american has organised this otherwise most
