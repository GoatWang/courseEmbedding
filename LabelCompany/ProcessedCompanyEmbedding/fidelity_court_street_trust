 under a retirement program adopted in july  and modified in november  and november  each noninterested trustee who retired before december   may receive payments from a fidelity fund during his or her lifetime based on his or her basic trustee fees and length of service the obligation of a fund to make such payments is neither secured nor funded a trustee became eligible to participate in the program at the end of the calendar year in which he or she reached age  provided that at the time of retirement he or she had served as a fidelity fund trustee for at least five years under a deferred compensation plan adopted in september  and amended in november  the plan noninterested trustees must defer receipt of a portion of and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of their annual fees amounts deferred under the plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of a crosssection of fidelity funds including funds in each major investment discipline and representing a majority of fidelitys assets under management the reference funds the amounts ultimately received by the trustees under the plan will be directly linked to the investment performance of the reference funds deferral of fees in accordance with the plan will have a negligible effect on a funds assets liabilities and net income per share and will not obligate a fund to retain the services of any trustee or to pay any particular level of compensation to the trustee a fund may invest in the reference funds under the plan without shareholder approval as of december   the noninterested trustees terminated the retirement program for trustees who retire after such date in connection with the termination of the retirement program each thenexisting noninterested trustee received a credit to his or her plan account equal to the present value of the estimated benefits that would have been payable under the retirement program the amounts credited to the noninterested trustees plan accounts are subject to vesting and are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the reference funds the amounts ultimately received by the trustees in connection with the credits to their plan accounts will be directly linked to the investment performance of the reference funds the termination of the retirement program and related crediting of estimated benefits to the trustees plan accounts did not result in a material cost to the funds  to ratify the selection of coopers  lybrand llp as independent accountants of the trust by a vote of the noninterested trustees the firm of coopers  lybrand llp has been selected as independent accountants for each fund to sign or certify any financial statements of each fund required by any law or regulation to be certified by an independent accountant and filed with the securities and exchange commission sec or any state pursuant to the  act such selection requires the ratification of shareholders in addition as required by the  act the vote of the trustees is subject to the right of e ach fund  by vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities at any meeting called for the purpose of voting on such action to terminate such employment without penalty coopers  lybrand llp has advised e ach fun d that it has no direct or material indirect ownership interest in e ach fund the independent accountants examine annual financial statements for the funds and provide other audit and taxrelated services in recommending the selection of the funds  accountants the audit committee reviewed the nature and scope of the services to be provided including nonaudit services and whether the performance of such services would affect the accountants independence representatives of coopers  lybrand llp are not expected to be present at the meeting but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring their presence on september   coopers  lybrand llp and price waterhouse llp announced plans to merge their practices world wide coopers  lybrand llp and price waterhouse llp expect the merger which is subject to approval by the partners of both organizations and by the regulators to become effective in early   to amend the trust instrument to provide dollarbased voting rights for shareholders of the trust the board of trustees has approved and recommends that shareholders of the trust approve a proposal to amend article vii section  of the trust instrument the amendment would provide voting rights based on a shareholders total dollar interest in a fund dollarbased voting rather than on the number of shares owned for all shareholder votes for a fund as a result voting power would be allocated in proportion to the value of each shareholders investment background connecticut municipal money market fund spartan connecticut municipal money market fund spartan florida municipal money market fund and new jersey municipal money market fund are funds of fidelity court street trust ii an openend management investment company organized as a delaware business trust currently there are four funds in the trust shareholders of each fund vote separately on matters concerning only that fund and vote on a trustwide basis on matters that affect the trust as a whole such as electing trustees or amending the trust instrument currently under the trust instrument each share is entitled to one vote regardless of the relative value of the shares of each fund in the trust the original intent of the oneshare onevote provision was to provide equitable voting rights to all shareholders as required by the  act in the case where a trust has several series or funds such as fidelity court street trust ii voting rights may have become disproportionate since the net asset value per share nav of the separate funds generally diverge over time the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec has issued a noaction letter permitting a trust to seek shareholder approval of a dollarbased voting system the proposed amendment will comply with the conditions stated in the noaction letter reason for proposal if approved the amendment would provide a more equitable distribution of voting rights for certain votes than the oneshare onevote system currently in effect the voting power of each shareholder would be commensurate with the value of the shareholders dollar investment rather than with the number of shares held under the current voting provisions an investment in a fund with a lower nav may have significantly greater voting power than the same dollar amount invested in a fund with a higher nav currently since there are only money market funds in the trust the proposal will not affect the voting rights of fund shareholders on votes requiring trustwide participation since money market funds are managed to maintain a  nav however if additional funds with fluctuating navs are added to the trust relative voting rights would be changed under the proposal to illustrate the potentially disproportionate calculation of voting power currently in place the table below shows a hypothetical example of a trust with funds with fluctuating navs fund net asset value  investment in terms of number of shares a    b    c    d    for example fund d shareholders would have ten times the voting power of fund a shareholders because a  investment in fund d would buy ten times as many shares as a  investment in fund a accordingly a oneshare onevote system may provide certain shareholders with a disproportionate ability to affect the vote relative to shareholders of other funds in the trust if dollarbased voting had been in effect each shareholder would have had  voting shares their voting power would be proportionate to their economic interest which fmr believes is a more equitable result and which is the result with respect to a typical corporation where each voting share generally has an equal market price on matters requiring trustwide votes where all funds are required to vote shareholders who own shares with a lower nav than other funds in the trust would be giving other shareholders in the trust more voting power than they currently have on matters affecting only one fund only shareholders of that fund vote on the issue in this instance under both the current trust instrument and an amended trust instrument all shareholders of the fund would have the same voting rights since the nav is the same for all shares in a single fund amendment to the trust instrument article vii section  sets forth the method of calculating voting rights for all shareholder votes for the trust if approved article vii section  will be amended as follows material to be added is  underlined  and material to be deleted is bracketed article vii shareholders voting powers and meetings voting powers section  the s hareholders shall have power to vote    on any matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders all shares shall be voted separately by individual series except i when required by the  act shares shall be voted in the aggregate and not by individual series and ii when the trustees have determined that the matter affects the interests of more than one series then the shareholders of all such series shall be entitled to vote thereon the trustees may also determine that a matter affects only the interests of one or more classes of a series in which case any such matters shall be voted on by such class or classes each whole share shall be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to vote and each fractional share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote  a shareholder of each series shall be entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value number of shares owned times net asset value per share of such series on any matter on which such shareholder is entitled to vote and each fractional dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote  there shall be no cumulative voting in the election of trustees shares may be voted in person or by proxy or in any manner provided for in the bylaws a proxy may be given in writing the bylaws may provide that proxies may also or may instead be given by any electronic or telecommunications device or in any other manner notwithstanding anything else herein or in the bylaws in the event a proposal by anyone other than the officers or trustees of the trust is submitted

the trust shares may be voted only in person or by written proxy until shares are issued the trustees may exercise all rights of shareholders and may take any action required or permitted by law this

subadvisory agreement the subadviser is authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and will do so in accordance with the policies described below the receipt of research from brokerdealers that execute transactions on behalf of the fund may be useful to fmr in rendering investment management services to the fund and to its other clients and conversely such research provided by brokerdealers who execute transaction orders on behalf of other fmr clients may be useful to fmr in carrying out its obligations to the fund the receipt of such research has not reduced fmrs normal independent research activities however it enables fmr to avoid additional expenses that could be incurred if fmr tried to develop comparable information through its own efforts subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws brokerdealers may receive commissions for agency transactions that are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other brokerdealers in recognition of their research and execution services in order to cause the fund to pay such higher commissions fmr must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such executing brokerdealers viewed in terms of a particular transaction or fmrs overall responsibilities to the fund and its other clients in reaching this determination fmr will not attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research services provided or to determine what portion of the compensation should be related to those services the fund has already been authorized by the board of trustees consistent with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission to place portfolio transactions through brokerdealers who are affiliated with fmr and through brokerdealers who provide research the amended contract expressly recognizes this authority matters considered by the board the mutual funds for which the members of the board of trustees serve as trustees are referred to herein as the fidelity funds the board of trustees meets

performance f investment management staffing g the potential for achieving further economies of scale h operating expenses paid to third parties and i the information furnished to investors including the funds shareholders in considering the amended contract the board of trustees and the independent trustees did not identify any single factor as allimportant or controlling and the following summary does not detail all the matters considered matters considered by the board of trustees and the independent trustees in connection with their approval of the amended contract include the following investment compliance and performance the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered whether the fund has operated within its investment objective and its record of compliance with its investment restrictions they also reviewed monthly the funds investment performance as well as the performance of a peer group of mutual funds and the performance of an appropriate index or combination of indices fmrs personnel and methods the board of trustees and the independent trustees annually review a report detailing the background of the funds portfolio manager and the funds investment objective and discipline the independent trustees have also had discussions with senior management of fmr responsible for investment operations and the senior management of fidelitys money market group among other things they considered the size education and experience of fmrs investment staff its use of technology and fmrs approach to recruiting training and retaining portfolio managers and other research advisory and management personnel nature and quality of other services the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered the nature quality cost and extent of administrative and shareholder services performed by fmr and affiliated companies both under the amended contract and under separate agreements covering transfer agency functions and pricing bookkeeping and securities lending services if any the board of trustees and the independent trustees have also considered the nature and extent of fmrs supervision of third party service providers principally custodians and subcustodians expenses the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered the funds expense ratio and expense ratios of a peer group of funds they also considered the amount and nature of fees paid by shareholders profitability the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered the level of fmrs profits in respect of the management of the fidelity funds including the fund this consideration included an extensive review of fmrs methodology in allocating its costs to the management of the fund the board of trustees and the independent trustees have concluded that the cost allocation methodology employed by fmr has a reasonable basis and is appropriate in light of all of the circumstances they considered the profits realized by fmr in connection with the operation of the fund and whether the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the fund they also considered the profits realized from nonfund businesses which may benefit from or be related to the funds business the board of trustees and the independent trustees also considered fmrs profit margins in comparison with available industry data both accounting for and ignoring marketing expenses economies of scale the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered whether there have been economies of scale in respect of the management of the fidelity funds whether the fidelity funds including the fund have appropriately benefitted from any economies of scale and whether there is potential for realization of any further economies of scale the board of trustees and the independent trustees have concluded that fmrs mutual fund business presents some limited opportunities to realize economies of scale and that these economies are being shared between fund shareholders and fmr in an appropriate manner the independent trustees have also concluded that the existing group fee structure should be continued but determined that it would be appropriate to change the group fee structure as proposed herein other benefits to fmr the board of trustees and the independent trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the fund and the funds shareholders for services provided by fmr and its affiliates including fees for services like transfer agency fund accounting and direct shareholder services they also considered the allocation of fund brokerage to brokers affiliated with fmr and the receipt of sales loads and payments under rule b plans in respect of certain of the fidelity funds

brokerage capital markets trust investment advisory pension record keeping credit card insurance publishing real estate international research and investment funds and others the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered the intangible benefits that accrue to fmr and its affiliates by virtue of their relationship with the fund other benefits to shareholders the board of trustees and the independent trustees considered the benefit to shareholders of investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of fund and shareholder services with regard to the section of the proposed contract describing the changes to portfolio transactions the trustees considered the value of research provided by the brokerdealers the quality of the execution services provided and the level of commissions paid while the fund does not generally purchase securities through a brokerdealer by paying commissions the board of trustees determined that amending the management contract to expressly recognize the authority of fmr to use affiliated brokerdealers and brokerdealers who provide research services furthers the goal of standardizing management contracts for fidelity funds and that explicitly permitting all fidelity funds to utilize certain brokerdealers is beneficial to the fund conclusion based on their evaluation of all material factors and assisted by the advice of independent counsel the trustees concluded i that the existing management fee structure is fair and reasonable and ii that the proposed modifications to the management fee structure that is the reduction of the group fee rate schedule and the addition of the discussion of fmrs ability to use brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions are in the best interest of the funds shareholders the board of trustees including the independent trustees voted to approve the submission of the amended contract to shareholders of the fund and recommends that shareholders of the fund vote for the amended contract adoption of standardized investment limitations the primary purpose of proposals  and  is to revise certain of the funds investment limitations to conform to limitations which are standard for similar types of funds managed by fmr the board of trustees asked fmr to analyze the various fundamental and nonfundamental investment limitations of the fidelity funds and where practical and appropriate to a funds investment objective and policies propose to shareholders adoption of standard fundamental limitations and elimination of certain other fundamental limitations generally when fundamental limitations are eliminated fidelitys standard nonfundamental limitations replace them by making these limitations nonfundamental the board of trustees may amend a limitation as they deem appropriate without seeking shareholder approval the board of trustees would amend the limitations to respond for instance to developments in the marketplace or changes in federal or state law the costs of shareholder meetings called for these purposes are generally borne by a fund and its shareholders it is not anticipated that these proposals will substantially affect the way a fund is currently managed however fmr is presenting them to you for your approval because fmr believes that increased standardization will help to promote operational efficiencies and facilitate monitoring of compliance with fundamental and nonfundamental investment limitations although adoption of a new or revised limitation is not likely to have any impact on the current investment techniques employed by a fund it will contribute to the overall objectives of standardization  to amend fidelity connecticut municipal money market funds and fidelity new jersey municipal money market funds fundamental investment limitation concerning the issuance of senior securities each funds current fundamental investment limitation regarding the issuance of senior securities states the fund may not issue bonds or any other class of securities preferred over shares of the fund in respect of the funds assets or earnings provided that fidelity court street trust ii may issue additional series of shares in accordance with the trust instrument the trustees recommend that shareholders vote to replace this limitation with the following fundamental investment limitation governing the issuance of senior securities the fund may not issue senior securities except as permitted under the investment company act of  the primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each funds fundamental senior securities limitation to conform to a limitation that is expected to become standard for all funds managed by fmr see adoption of standardized investment limitations on page  if the proposal is approved the new fundamental senior securities limitation cannot be changed without the approval of shareholders adoption of the proposed limitation on senior securities is not expected to affect the way in which each fund is managed the investment performance of each fund or the securities or instruments in which each fund invests however the proposed limitation clarifies that each fund may issue senior securities to the extent permitted under the  act although the definition of a senior security involves complex statutory and regulatory concepts a senior security is generally thought of as an obligation of a fund which has a claim to the funds assets or earnings that takes precedence over the claims of the funds shareholders the  act generally prohibits mutual funds from issuing senior securities however mutual funds are permitted to engage in certain types of transactions that might be considered senior securities as long as certain conditions are satisfied for example a transaction which obligates a fund to pay money at a future date eg the purchase of securities for settlement on a date that is further away than the normal settlement period may be considered a senior security a mutual fund however is permitted to enter into this type of transaction if it maintains a segregated account containing liquid securities in an amount equal to its obligation to pay cash for the securities at a future date each fund utilizes transactions that may be considered senior securities only in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements under the  act conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit each fund and its shareholders the trustees recommend voting for the proposal upon shareholder approval the amended fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is revised to reflect the changes if the proposal is not approved by the shareholders of a fund that funds current limitation will remain unchanged  to amend fidelity connecticut municipal money market funds fidelity new jersey municipal money market funds and spartan connecticut municipal money market funds fundamental investment limitation concerning the concentration of its investments in a single industry fidelity connecticut municipal money market funds and fidelity new jersey municipal money market funds current fundamental investment limitation concerning the concentration of its investments within a single industry states the fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies instrumentalities territories or possessions or issued or guaranteed by a state government or political subdivision thereof if as a result more than  of the value of its total assets would be invested in securities of companies having their principal business activities

may not purchase the securities of any issuer other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities or municipal securities issued or guaranteed by a us territory or possession or a state or local government or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry the trustees recommend that shareholders of each fund vote to replace this fundamental investment limitation with the following amended fundamental investment limitation governing concentration the fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities or taxexempt obligations issued or guaranteed by a us territory or possession or a state or local government or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry the primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each funds fundamental concentration limitation to conform to a limitation which is expected to become standard for all municipal funds managed by fmr see adoption of standardized investment limitations on page  for spartan connecticut municipal money market fund the impact of the change in the investment limitation is that certain private purpose municipal securities that are municipal securities but not taxexempt obligations under the taxreform act of  are no longer excluded from the concentration limits if the proposal is approved the new fundamental concentration limitation could not be changed without the approval of shareholders adoption of the proposed amended limitation on concentration is not expected to affect the way each fund is managed the investment performance of each fund or the securities or instruments in which each fund invests the proposed amended limitation is not substantially different from the current policy and is not likely to have any impact on the investment techniques employed by each fund conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit each fund and its shareholders the trustees recommend voting for the proposal upon shareholder approval the amended fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is revised to reflect the changes if the proposal is not approved by the shareholders of a fund that funds current limitation will remain unchanged other business the board knows of no other business to be brought before the meeting however if any other
