idisclose announces free online tool to conform documents to sec acceptable format new york ny–marketwired – august   – idisclose announced today that it is offering a free online service to help issuers and their counsel submit the required crowdfunding documents to the securities and exchange commission idisclose ceo georgia quinn explained that “we have noticed a lot of people are having trouble uploading the required documents to the sec’s online system known as edgar this is due to the finicky nature of the system and somewhat archaic technology it uses several issuers’ uploads were getting bounced and the error messages were indecipherable” many times documents are bounced when people attempt to upload them to the sec’s electronic data gathering analysis and retrieval system or “edgar” system because the actual file does not meet certain technical specifications or contains certain “tags” that edgar rejects idisclose’s new sec scrubber “cleans” so to speak the documents of any tags or unacceptable formatting without altering any of the content so they are able to be filed when asked why idisclose is offering this service for free quinn stated “we are doing this because we believe in the power of crowdfunding and we want to see this industry succeed this has been a silly stumbling block for hardworking and well prepared issuers and we want to remove it” a betaversion of the sec scrubber is being released to the public today and idisclose is taking comments and feedback to improve the tool in its next release idisclose is an online application that helps

new industry are an example of how technology can overcome traditional challenges faced by small and startup businesses when it comes to raising money i love what we are doing because we protect both the issuer and the investor — there are no losers here” cofounder and ceo of republic and angellist alum kendrick nguyen said “few people understand this space better than georgia republic’s collaboration with idisclose has been important to our development of a product that meets regulatory best practices and is also manageable and affordable to issuers” funding wonder cofounder and ceo

automate much of this process and i can’t think of a better way to balance legal compliance with a costeffective and streamlined process that will appeal to techenabled issuers” idisclose’s form c application is being released contemporaneously with the may theffectiveness in the us of the sec’s new title iii regulation crowdfunding rules and is available at idisclosecom or through its partner funding portals “equity crowdfunding has the potential to become the standard way that earlystage startups and small businesses raise capital but only with the development of scalable tools that continue to bring down the cost and complexity” said seedinvest ceo ryan feit “at the end of the day speed and simplicity is what will drive entrepreneurs to utilize equity crowdfunding over slower more traditional avenues for raising capital” built by some of the brightest minds in securities law idisclose fuses cuttingedge technology with legal knowhow to significantly reduce the time money

in september idisclose announced its first application release for the comprehensive use in creating a full private placement memorandum ppm for offerings under regulation d of the securities act of 9 and has partnerships with title ii funding platforms such as realtyxe and sprowttcom in addition to entering into agreements with funding platforms idisclose has also released a white label solution for lawyers and law firms to offer both the ppm and the form c application to their clients idisclose puts the job of disclosure back into the hands of the entrepreneur eliminating the inefficiencies of the traditional method and substantial time to comply with the rules and saving thousands of dollars as well rather than provide uncontextualized information about a business to a lawyer and then relying on the lawyer to prepare the first draft the entrepreneur responds to an online dialogue to draw out the relevant disclosure issues and the platform organizes the information into a legal document throughout the entire process the entrepreneur is able to collaborate with their own team and attorney as needed and to send their attorney their document drafts for final review and signoff idisclose also generates a red flag report of key issues that must be addressed which can also be shared with an attorney for further advice and counsel in addition the platform creates a list of risks factors that are seamlessly organized within the document for easy review by investors target groups that benefit from idisclose include for businesses the platform allows you to create your own legal documents at a reduced time and cost for investors idisclose provides fulsome disclosure in an easy to evaluate format for fundraising platforms idisclose allows platforms to offer a valueadded service to their users and standardizes the disclosure format across the entire platform for lawyers it eliminates much of the drafting drudgery required with the disclosure process and allows lawyers to focus on the true aspects of being a lawyer offering real legal counsel guidance and reviews idisclose was developed by douglas ellenoff and georgia quinn of ellenoff grossman  schole who are both awardwinning nybased corporate attorneys and globallyrecognized figures in the alternative finance space having both facilitated hundreds of corporate financings over the course of their careers the
