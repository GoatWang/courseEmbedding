elope with mickey or minnie for that matter or get dizzy and fall off the teacups resulting in amnesia i have just been soooo incredibly busy lately i have really missed visiting you guys here and have sent tons of people this way though so glad to see a lot of the people i recognize are still here  so to get on with the topic  i have been working as a loan officer in the mortgage industry for the last  months one thing that i would like to be able to offer to more of my customers that are going the ownerbuilder route is more options for their construction loan lender i only personally know of  lenders that will lend to ownerbuilders of those of you who ownerbuilt who did you use for your construction loan  dont answer if you went with a gc cause there are tons of banks that will do construction lending with a gc i have been searching the internet and this is what i have copied and pasted  bismark mortgage has some interesting programs they come highly recommended by brokers and are very flexible with owner builders accepts scores as low as  site supervisor or contractor is not required fireball financial  midlothian texas   mid america mortgage   north cedar ridge st  duncanvilletexas   or  indymac does  for owner builder  if you use buildmax or a construction supervisor mid country bank does up to  on land and construction they lend for icf sips modular and green homes very open to new building technology i have been told that they can work with scores as low as  if the dti isnt too high site supervisor or contractor is not required m  t mortgage offers loans for land and construction with as little as  down if you own the land that goes towards your down payment united midwest bank offers construction loans with  down if the land is owned or has equity that is used towards the downpayment a  middle score is needed for this loan site supervisor or contractor is not required they will ask you to fill out a form indicating you are knowledgeable about the construction process  this list is a start who else can you recommend  national lenders or local lenders are fine as long as they will lend to ownerbuilders thanks  email commentbookmarklike

for our ownerbuilder loan but they required a ca licensed general contractor to be listed as a consulting contractor on the loan i checked with the list of contractors they referred and they all wanted  of the cost of the house for their compensation not much benefit to being an ownerbuilder in that case we ended up finding a friend of a friend who would be our consultant he charged us  for

was surprised how challenging it was as an ob to get a construction loan we finally found two regional banks through other obs in our area that handle this type of loan i guess these are pretty high risk why loan a person with no experience in construction a significant amount of money to build a house i have some construction background coupled with a fair amount of capital and was still surprised how difficult it was to get a loan i would tell you who i used but i cannot give them a positive reference so i will keep it off the forum you can tell where i live if you are in my region pm me and i will give you a source they used to be better alot of our subs used to bank there as well but some executive changes have been made and alot of the construction business have changed where they bank as a result  like    bookmark     november   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo wlucinda our local bank no problems and we had to get a  month extension to complete

we are in washington state puget sound area and still in the process of finding and deciding on a bank to finance our diy ob project my dh teaches home construction so has lots of building experience and expertise but doesnt have a contractors license im thinking the banks want someone with a bond to go after money if necessary since one bank told us it wouldnt matter what trade he was licensed in building painting excavation just that they require a license they obviously werent looking for a certain level of housebuilding experience so far weve found westsound thanks to someone on this forum and timberland that will deal with ownerbuilders there are a couple of others we talked to with good service lower rates and faster closing but they require a licensed contractor to sign on then all drafts and paperwork would have to go through that person creating work and expense that theyd have to pass on to us timberland has a voucher method for payment that im unsure of and i am worried about their bookkeepingmaybe just a technology problem we have our land loan through them and they can never tell me how much interest weve accruedi always have to wait for the monthly statementand they have improperly applied  of our payments the contact person weve dealt with there though was very helpful and creative when we needed help with the land loan they do seem to be able to make individual decisions appropriate to individual customer needs westsound is currently undergoing some changes with their construction financing so i am waiting to see how that all works out and checking for other options at the same timeso id welcome any other suggestions  like    bookmark     july   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo builderswife our local bank handled our loan

you for reporting this comment undo lisakk rhome we just finished our house in march in issaquah we used timberland bank i was a little worried about the voucher method but it turned out to be pretty simple the guy i dealt with gary masterjohn at their auburn branch was easy to work with the only thing i would have done differently was to open a checking account with timberland during construction that way they will deposit your voucher checks to reimburse you for outofpocket expenses directly into that checking account you will get your money about two days earlier that way pretty much all the subs i dealt with had either worked with timberlands system before or were okay with it i was always sure to go over it with them as soon as i accepted their bid so they werent surprised the construction loans are handled out of spanaway typically the turnaround time was two to three days from when the sub mailed his voucher in we considered west sound but we were informed by them that they were a quarter point higher than timberland because they allow draws at any time of the month timberland generally wants to pay after the monthly inspection done by the th they were always willing to make exceptions to this though  like    bookmark     july   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo rhome lisakk thanks for the info and report on your experience with timberland so it was no problem to pay cashpay ahead for things then get reimbursed my dh knows different people who say they can get them good prices on things but im sure that in most cases when someone is willing to give you a good price they want cash not paperwork hassles we will be buying materials not really paying subs since we will be doing all but  or  things ourselves  like    bookmark     july

would be ready to do the draw but they said that it was no problem if we needed to advance some early throughout the loan  just give them the contractor bid actually ive been very surprised throughout the process of how easy the loan was to get  honestly expected more of a problem our rate was prime and it will convert to a mortgage at completion with no extra closing costs locking in a rate  days before completion  like    bookmark     july   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo hitzjk do not evereverever use wells fargo bank for a construction loan it would take hours of typing to

budget or not completing the project because of this many banks and building societies have withdrawn their funding for people that are building their own home lenders tend to view some applicants more favourably than others applicants that are licensed builders have experience with one or more trades or are using a program such as the home building system are seen as a lower risk for more

homes have you run out of money half way through your owner builder project has your bank refused to lend you additional funds to complete your home unfortunately almost every lender in australia won’t accept a partially built home as security for a mortgage you must apply for the loan either before you start construction or when the construction is completed however if you need additional funds during construction we can help you in the following situations owner builder we can lend up to  of the total cost licensed builder building their own home  of the total cost standard

charge a brokerage fee as there is significantly more work involved then there is for a standard home loan using a guarantor with a construction loan if you have a friend or family member that can guarantee your loan then you may be able to borrow more than  of the project cost and up to a maximum of  on a case by case basis for more information please refer to our no deposit guarantor loan page standard guarantor loans aren’t available so you’ll need to apply for an  guarantor loan this is where the guarantor takes out a mortgage on their property and then lends this to you to make up the difference between your  mortgage secured by your property and the amount that you require to complete the project for more information on how a guarantor can help you get a construction loan please call us on    or fill in our free assessment form we can make the application process less stressful for you how are the loan funds advanced unlike a traditional home loan the lender won’t pay you all of the loan funds when the loan is setup instead they’ll release funds to you as construction progresses this is known as ‘progress payments’ or ‘construction draw downs’ once you have completed each step of construction a bank valuer will be sent out to assess your work confirm you have followed the floor plans and then authorise the bank to make the next payment if you have significant equity available in your land then we may be able to arrange a line of credit based on the value of your land alone this will allow you to build your new home without the need for the lender to monitor your progress this is usually available when you’re borrowing no more than  to  of the land value alone which documents do you need to provide as an owner builder you’ll need to provide more documents than a traditional borrower building plans  floor plans an itemized estimate of the total cost of construction a copy of your owner builder insurance if applicable evidence that you are using the home building system if applicable a copy of your owner builder permit if applicable once you have obtained council approval you’ll be required to provide a copy of the council approved plans to the lender value or cost when lenders assess the value of a property that’s yet to be built they ask their valuer to complete a ‘to be erected’ tbe valuation typically the valuer will look at the plans the cost of construction and in almost all cases will value the construction project at the value of the land plus the cost of construction lenders are always conservative when assessing the value of the property you’re using as security they will use the lesser amount of the actual valuation or the total of the purchase price  value of the land and cost of construction this is no different for owner builder loans and as a result it’s important to have significant equity in your vacant land otherwise you may be unable to obtain a loan approval please complete our free assessment form or speak to us on    for more information our mortgage brokers will aim to assist you in getting the loan amount you need call us today what type of building license do you have there are many different types of building licenses with different restrictions placed on each one the lenders that we work with for owner builder finance tend to prefer borrowers who have an unlimited building license rather than a project management license if you have an unlimited building license you’ll have a better selection of lenders to work with of course if you don’t have a building licence at all then you’re still eligible for an owner builder loan but you’ll need a larger deposit the golden rules we’ve helped a lot of owner builders finance their construction project follow these simple rules to avoid the headaches don’t run out of money if you run out of money during construction then in most cases the bank won’t approve a loan increase for you in other words you’re in big trouble we have one lender that may be able to help if you run out of money however unless you’re a licensed builder yourself they won’t lend any more than  of the project cost don’t begin construction yet wait until your loan is formally approved before you commence construction the majority of lenders won’t approve a loan if you have already commenced construction unfortunately many people aren’t told this by their bank most people begin building using their savings and only apply for a loan towards the end of the project when they run short of funds budget carefully complete a cost estimate worksheet before beginning your project you’ll need to provide this to the bank as part of your loan approval please make this as accurate as possible and include a contingency incase you go over budget if this isn’t done properly then you risk running out of money in addition try not to make many changes after your loan is approved because you may need to reapply for your mortgage experience counts are you sure you know what you’re doing if you have trouble creating the budget for your project or don’t have a background in the construction industry then we don’t recommend that you build your own home inexperienced owner builders are almost certain to regret the decision to build their own home do you need help to apply for your owner builder mortgage please call us on    or
