download this press release  nanojet process to be applied to mass production of wearable products westborough massbusiness wire kopin® corporation nasdaq kopn a leading developer of innovative wearable computing technologies and solutions announced that it has developed a revolutionary nanojet process for its liquid crystal cell assembly the nanojet process releases tiny drops of liquid crystal material with greater precision variation within a few nano grams and provides for a purer better controlled and very uniform layering of the liquid crystal material in the fabrication of displays resulting in superior image quality and higher brightness “the patentpending nanojet process developed at kopin is optimized for microdisplays with tiny pixels required for augmented reality ar and virtual reality vr applications” said dr john cc fan president and ceo of kopin corporation “this process improves the display performance and reduces the cost to manufacture the display the nanojet process can be used in the manufacture of both our transmissive cyberdisplay® and reflective lcos displays we are qualifying the nanojet process and expect a tierone customer to introduce in coming months a wearable product which includes a display manufactured using the nanojet process it is our intention to apply this superior process to many of our current products where ever possible” advantages of the nanojet process include maintenance of purity of the liquid crystal in the display fabrication process excellent control of cell gap and cell gap uniformity across the wafer and within each display even for large ” diagonal highresolution microdisplays for vr without the use of posts inside the display reduced display cost due to higher manufacturing yield and less liquid crystal material usage display performance improvements include superior image quality much higher display brightness in excess of  nits for fullcolor displays with tiny pixels  x  µm typically needed for smart headsets increased high temperature operating range about kopin kopin corporation is a leading developer of innovative wearable computing technologies and solutions kopin’s technology
