to adestos president and ceo narbeh derhacobian narbeh please go ahead narbeh derhacobian thank you leanne welcome to everyone joining us today as highlighted in our press release today i am pleased with our execution in the first quarter with the revenue at high end upper guidance operating expenses below guidance where it was below guidance enabling us to be well on track to achieve our target at ebitda breakeven and by middle of the year entering the second quarter were excited to see a strong backlog and bookings in our business driven by design wins that are ramping into production across our customer base additionally we had another strong quarter of new design wins in which we secured over  design wins totaling an annual revenue runway potential of  million of course assuming design wins reaching full production and its always subject to market conditions this continued momentum of new opportunities should help to secure our expected growth in the second half of  and into  from an end market perspective approximately  of the design wins were secured in the industrial market while consumer markets represented approximately  of the wins notable design wins included a high volume smart lighting application as well as wins for communication modules in personal computing devices and a highvolume smartphone application i had also indicated previously that we started an initiative to focus on large tier  odms to secure highvolume revenue opportunities for our products and im happy to indicate that in q  we secured design wins with several such customers in computing and communication end markets these customers are utilizing multiple adesto products across different applications demonstrating the increasing content and the breath of opportunities we have across our client base as a direct result of our focus on diversifying and expanding our customer base over twothirds of the design wins in the first quarter with new customers another key initiative for us has been to further diversify our business beyond our stronghold in the industrial market into markets where the duration from design win to production shorter and represents higher volume opportunities in the first quarter we had success along these lines as well of the top  design wins secured in the first quarter ranked by annual dollar value approximately half are in consumer market and the other half in computing one of our biggest assets is our large and top tier customer base we supply our customers in a variety of ways including direct through distribution fulfillment houses and through contract manufacturers hence as i indicated previously its not a trivial task to trace accurately design win conversion wins into production the last several quarters we have put forth efforts to identify cases where we can clearly track design wins through the channel and into mass production with the end customers and id like to share this data with you looking at the design wins in  that could be traced clearly in the channel and into production we can say that approximately twothirds of them have started to ramp into production some are early in their production and some have ramped as expected as we progress through the year additional design wins was also beginning ramping into production layering onto this growing pipeline of revenue generating designs this is encouraging as it validates our investment and focus on expanding our base to support our growth profile as evidenced by our expectations for the second quarter in terms of our top  revenue customers in the first quarter the revenue breakdown by end market consisted of  from industrial market  from consumer market and the remaining  is spread across communication medical automotive and computing examples of applications that are currently in volume production at these customers includes smart meters as our largest customer universal remotes personal tracking devices streaming tv and media player and many others with that let me take a few minutes to talk about some of our product families in more detail in the first quarter we taped out our nm version of our mb dataflash family this is a follow up tape out at nanometer as we taped out at mb dataflash last year as we communicated to you this is a cost reduction initiative for our dataflash family we will be sampling these products with our leading industrial customers for the rest of the year and into  also during the quarter we continue to make progress sampling our at dataflash products that are designed specifically for the asia smart meter market as ive mentioned previously this is product family that offers limited feature set alternative targeting china smart meter customers and is more suitable for the costconscious metering and industrial markets such as the ones in china we continue to monitor market demand for dataflash to see the need for densities beyond  and mb at advance notes and will roll out those efforts into our planning when appropriate we have close working relationships with our metering and industrial customers and always align our development efforts with our partners product roadmaps turning to our fusion family we continue to generate increasing revenue and interest for this product as i mentioned last quarter this product family had experienced a rapid ramping shipments becoming one of our fasted growing lines as many of you know our existing portfolio are fusion flash products range from kb to mb in order to expand these offerings we have focused our development efforts on additional densities starting with mb mb and mb which we expect to tape out in the fourth quarter we expect to sample these additional densities in mid looking at our ecoxip product family we also continue to make solid progress on our development and sampling activities engineering samples of our mb device have been provided to our early customers and partners the broader rollup of this product will occur in the fourth quarter and in  we have started design activity of mb ecoxip and expect to tape out this product this quarter the mb version of the ecoxip will be taped out later this year by mid we believe we should have mb mb and mb versions of the ecoxip in various levels of silicon sampling and hopefully in production with some of our early partners our ecoxip products can be deployed in many types of iot and embedded devices including wearables medical monitors pos controllers sensors and beacons leading mcu and systemonchip customers such as nxpqualcomm are among the early designing customers industry leaders believe that as soc and mcus move to nm and below embedding nonvolatile memory functionality becomes extremely expensive ecoxip offers an ideal solution for such cases where performance cost and power characteristics of an ecoxip device as a systeminpackage becomes an attractive alternative to todays solutions last quarter we also tapedout a version of our mavriq family designed for the camera module per plan this is kb serial nonvolatile memory device thats ideally suited for this growing market we believe this is a very large market opportunity for adesto and well be actively engaged with customers and contract manufacturers to assess their specific needs while also furthering seeding the market this opportunity becomes even more attractive as the density requirements increase in the coming years because the mavriq platformbase devices are more cost effective than alternative eeprom which are used today we continue to work toward securing design wins for this application and expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarters lastly in terms of standard serial flash product family we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various highvolume opportunities for notebooks and tablets as well as consumer end markets during the first quarter we secured notable design wins for highvolume smart lighting applications with a leading soc company this particular design win is ramping into production this year we have also secured design wins in a wearables application with a global navigation and variable technology company as many of you recall we began increasing our investment activity around this product group in the third quarter of  as an extension of our strategy to pursue higher unit volumes and faster ramping opportunities to further diversify our customer base and revenue since that time we have made notable progress with customers as well as expansion of our product offerings across densities these products have helped drive additional revenue opportunities near term as the result of the shorter design cycles by also broadening our footprint with customers as i mentioned last quarter we anticipate revenue contribution from these products to approach approximately  exiting the year which will represents a significant underlying growth rate for this time in summary we look to the second quarter the combination of design wins ramping into production and continued traction with new products is driving our expectation for strong growth with revenue projected to grow  yearoveryear entering q we have record bookings and backlogs and were seeing this trend continue as we progress through the quarter this sets the stage for continued momentum across our end markets and product families in the second half of this year with that i will now turn the call over to ron to review the first quarter financial results in more detail as well as more details on our second quarter outlook ron ron shelton thanks narbeh and thanks everyone for joining today revenue in the first quarter ended march   was  million and that was at the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of approximately  from the  million in the first quarter of last year and it was down seasonally  from  million last quarter gross margin in the first quarter was  as compared to  in the first quarter of  and  last quarter gross margins continue to remain at the high end of our long term model and reflect the fact that the market continues to embrace the value added differentiated solutions we provide the slight decline sequentially in gross margin was due to primary to product mix and the impacted of fixed costs on a lower revenue base we continue to expect gross margins to remain near  but on a quarter to quarter basis they may fluctuate approximately  to  basis points longer term gross margins will continue to be supported by new products with higher value added content continued cost reduction initiatives and migration to lower process notes in addition we continue to experience a favorable pricing and competitive environment and anticipated pricing pressure in  will remain subdued gaap operating expenses in the first quarter were  million as compared to  million in the prior year quarter and that quarter included a gain of  million from a settlement with the former foundry supplier gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter of  were  million on a nongaap basis operating expenses in the first quarter were  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the prior quarter for the full year  we expect nongaap opex to remain relatively flat when compared to  now looking at first quarter nongaap opex in more detail rd expenses were  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the prior quarter we continue to focus our resources on several market opportunities that we believe can have a more near term revenue contribution and thats resulted in lower rd expenditures nongaap sales and marketing expenses were  million as compared to  million in the year ago period and  million last quarter nongaap ga expenses were  million as compared to  million in the year ago quarter and  million last quarter stock base comp in the first quarter was  amortization of intangible assets was  and depreciation in amortization was  accounting for these items adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  was a loss of  million as compared to a loss of  million in the first quarter of  and a loss of  last quarter gaap net loss for the first quarter was  million or  per share as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  first quarter nongaap net loss was  million so  per share as compared to net loss of  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  share count used to compute the fourth quarter gaap and nongaap net loss was  million shares in terms of balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million in cash inventory at the end of the quarter was  million thats down from  million last quarter our inventory metrics have continued to improve over last year and this quarter exceeded our targeted turns of x accounts receivable was  million that represents a dso of approximately every  days now with respect to guidance for the second quarter of  we currently expect to achieve a record revenue level ranging between  million to  million at the midpoint this implies year over year revenue growth of  gross margin for the second quarter is expected to range between  and  gaap operating expenses are expected to range between  million and  million and nongaap operating expenses between  million and  million stock base comp in the second quarter will be approximately  amortization of intangible assets will be approximately  and depreciation and amortization will be approximately  weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately  million shares in the second quarter so before opening the call of questions id like to summarize my comments and operating objectives first we continue to control operating expenses and demonstrate leverage in our operating model second we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter by  over the prior year period and set a new quarterly record third were on track to achieve our target of ebitda breakeven by the middle of the year fourth we have direct access to additional working capital exceeded with our recently filed shelf offering which has been declared effective by the sec and lastly we remain focus on winning more designs and new customers in the months ahead with that well open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from gary mobley of benchmark your line is open gary mobley good afternoon gentlemen congrats on a strong quarter and a strong guide a question about the pricing environment i think its been pretty well documented that some of your more commodity or competitors or comparables over in taiwan had been raising prices and experiencing tight supply and its also my understanding that you guys have preterm and pricing schedules with customers so how has this overall pricing environment impacted you is it a situation where your asps are falling slower than expected or is it helping your design win traction as an alternative to these commodity memories since it might be more price comparable narbeh derhacobian hi gary its narbeh its more  the effect for us is more of the latter so as i mentioned previously when we do engage with our customer on applications with specific solutions the alternative for the customer is always to go the commodity route and of course we have to offer enough value with our solutions and ask a premium over the commodity that is just enough so the economics make sense for the customer so when prices are firming up on commodity devices with the types of more in securing design wins which is good for us because as you know this become more sticky design wins the effect were seeing today in terms of more immediate guides on where we ended up the quarter like you said is in part negotiating with the customers in the past and this recent price stability with the commodity supplier is not really affecting us that much gary mobley okay as it relates to the supply environment or tight supply environment or flash are you affected at all by perhaps some extremely utilization rates with some of your foundry partners narbeh derhacobian thats always a concern obviously when you have supply tightening the market and you know weve seen this before and we work very closely with our suppliers at various level and just to ensure that you know we can deliver to the customers so were aware of it and just like any of the other memory suppliers are and were on top of it and right now were not seeing any major concerns from that part gary mobley okay thats it for me thanks for taking my question guys narbeh derhacobian sure operator our next question comes from suji desilva of roth capital your line is open suji desilva hi narbeh hi ron congratulations on the strong results and guidance here so as we look at s growth we would be expecting do you think it comes more from the consumer side more from the industrial side or is it fairly balanced out or is there seasonality there narbeh derhacobian you mean for the rest of the year suji desilva correct narbeh derhacobian well i tell you its broadbased for us i think weve seen  you know for example weve seen some of our leading returning customers basically ramping into productions again these are all the design wins that we piled up and weve been talking about on different conference calls and conferences you know they are beginning to ramp into production and you know the industrial always has a longer lead time on consumer so i think thats the effects were seeing we dont see any particular market segment standing out either in a positive or a negative way suji desilva okay good thats helpful and then the new products that are coming online to help you grow with ecoxip and others are they on schedule to track to production versus where you expect it three months ago are any coming in sooner or any perhaps getting put out a little bit that color would be helpful narbeh derhacobian well everything is on schedule you know were aware you know the products that we taped out in the first quarter and are sampling with the early customers and i shed some color as what to expect for the rest of the year from new products tapeouts today in the call so far everything is on schedule suji desilva okay and then a quick question for ron ron the headcount kind of expectation the end of year versus now are you expecting to grow that count much or is that something thats relatively in place now ron shelton you know for the most part in place there might be one or two ads here or there but its effectively in place suji desilva okay two last questions one on the china meter market is that one that you think has a good kind of ramp opportunity in the second half because of the potential volumes there is that something that comes in slowly any thoughts there would be helpful narbeh derhacobian no i wouldnt  i  yes i think its like any industrial market it will be a slow ramp and if we have a key milestone outside what i just talked about we will basically communicate that but right now were just seeing an increased level of sampling activity for the various industrial markets metering being just one of them in asia suji desilva okay and then just one last clarification lighting is that going to be an industrial category or a consumer category or a mix of both narbeh derhacobian we put that in the consumer space suji desilva okay great thanks guys once again congratulations ron shelton thanks suji operator our next question comes from rick schafer of oppenheimer your line is open rick schafer yes thanks guys and ill add my congratulation as well maybe a follow up first to an earlier question would you be able to compare the revenue contribution from fusion flash you know you have cbram today and then maybe where you expect that kind of mix to look or what you expect it to look like exiting this year just to kind of give us an idea of the relative  maybe what relative growth rates are ron shelton yes hey rick this is ron you know today and historically dataflash has been about  of the revenue and i guess as we go through the year you know narbeh talked about in his earlier comments that the standard flash products may exit the year at  or around  of overall revenue and fusion will come up as we go through the year so i would expect dataflash to probably come down closer to  and with the balance split between standard serial flash and fusion this year cbram or  and ecoxip arent a material contributor to revenue and those will start to ramp sometime in  rick schafer okay thanks and then speaking of cbram i mean when we would look out toward earlier  or when you expect it to start ramping where do you see initial traction being the strongest there you know if youre talking about and end market like industrial or consumer pc elsewhere narbeh derhacobian yes so again i would focus more on the product families right so if i look the mavriq which is i think what youre referring to the mavriq family our main focus especially with this new camera module specific product that we tapedout is the camera module market obviously weve been getting qualified sampling with some contract manufacturers as i mentioned in that area just to seed the market and right now were engaged with all the top tier camera module manufacturers showcasing what we have today and also letting them know whats the new camera module specific product which is about to  we should have samples of that late in the year so once we have a design win i would be able to shed more color on that but our focus is going to be there in terms of the camera module market in  rick schafer got it thanks guys thats it for me operator our next question comes from rajvindra gill of needham  company your line is open rajvindra gill yes thanks for taking my questions and i echo the congratulations so a question on the ecoxip product can you talk a little bit about the  you know the asp for the product and the density for the product you know relative to the fusion family i would assume it would have higher asps potentially maybe if you could elaborate on that that would be helpful narbeh derhacobian sure so first in terms of density there is the first ecoxip product that we produced we have samples again either a mb and youre right typically the ecoxip products are targeting higher density applications so  and i mentioned were taping out the megabyte version of the ecoxip this quarter and really the way we decide what to tape out when is really the engagement with lead high volume customers to understand timing of when they are releasing their socs of mcus to intercept with that in terms of asps naturally they are higher than the fusion because first of all just with the memory so its a bigger die a discrete higher density higher asp but also more importantly the business model of ecoxip is slightly different than the fusion the fusion typically is sold as component package device we some opportunities that we sell fusion as a known good die but in the case of ecoxip the equation is reverse so wed be selling that more in terms of known good dies as a system in package applications and so as such the cost of the package and the  you know the final test is not a part of the product so average asps i would say you know its  youre looking above   again it depends on the customers and volumes and so forth whereas fusion family on the average asps youre looking at you know less than  you know close to half or less than that rajvindra gill all right thats helpful and we talk a little bit about  you know on the fusion flash business in the last quarter you said that you had shipped about  million fusion flash units and you expect that to double in  are we still on track there and can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the specific demand drivers for the fusion flash product this year has the design mix been changing for you narbeh derhacobian yes so the main driver again is vastly operated connected devices like bluetooth and so forth in terms of being on track for the half year the answer is yes if i look at volume shipment quarter q of  versus  were up significantly over last year for this quarter so were on track for  to hit the numbers that we talked about in  rajvindra gill and the last question for me ron in terms of the balance sheet how do we think about deleveraging i think in the past you had said that you were  you know theres a goal to pay down the debt how do we think about debt repayment and going forward thank you ron shelton sure so the terms thats amotizing right now is amortizing about a million seven a quarter so you know from  we talked about getting ebitda positive in the middle of this year you take that combined with you know growing revenues growing profitability you know managing working capital well we have enough capital today to service debt and run the business rajvindra gill thank you narbeh derhacobian yes operator our next question comes from orin hirschman of aigh investment partners your line is open orin hirschman hi how are you narbeh derhacobian hi orin how are you orin hirschman good okay im good ill ask you two question for now one is you had mentioned in the passing of the nxp what you are working on with nxp with qualcomm is that  were you referring to reference designs or were you referring to actually the first early design wins sorry i wasnt clear on that narbeh derhacobian so we talked about this in fact there was a press release on this as well the joint press release with nxp so its a design win for ecoxip product and again this one because its  really the product is being sold two ways to the customer in one case its going to be as a known good die to be attached within the package with mcus and the second case it would be a part of reference designs so its a combination of what you just mentioned orin hirschman okay but that first design was what you were  design win was what you were referring to narbeh derhacobian no so what  in case of the ecoxip the customer has to incorporate basically the interface to be able to take full advantage of the ecoxip inside their soc or mcus orin hirschman okay narbeh derhacobian so in the case of several customers and actually being one of them they have done that orin hirschman okay narbeh derhacobian in fact we designed the part in collaboration with several competing customers like nxp orin hirschman okay and just going back to the camera modules were you actually in  even if its very small volumes today or are you actually in the commercial module narbeh derhacobian no were not so what we did is we were able to showcase the benefits of the mavriq platform with a large contract manufacturer in the camera module and together we went to bid on a camera module business of a large chinese camera module maker what happened is the camera module marker decided to go with a different contract manufacturer so we adesto lost that opportunity but what it ended up happening is we realized its a huge opportunity and the mavriq platform is ideally suited for this application today and where its going two three four years down the road so we put a concerted effort to design solutions specific for that end market and since then this was about a year ago weve been engaged with other contract manufacturers as well as module makers to kind of prepare them for this new product that well be releasing end of the year orin hirschman and is the driver there the module maker or is the driver the actual end customer that makes whats in the handset narbeh derhacobian for  the first one is the module maker benefits is  cant come to the module maker the contract manufacturer or the end camera user because end of today were using the cost of embedding camera modules in gadgets orin hirschman okay great okay thanks very much operator there are no further questions id like to turn the call back over to narbeh for any closing remarks narbeh derhacobian thank you thanks for joining us today before i conclude todays call id like to let everyone know that we will be hosting meetings in new york around the oppenheimer emerging growth conference and needham emerging tech conference may th

thank you leanne and welcome to everyone joining us today i am pleased to report to ended the year with record revenue and gross margin we achieved our goal of growing second half revenue  over the first half as revenue in the fourth quarter grew approximately  sequentially to  million as we continued to see a strengthening in orders across our end markets and product families gross margin expanded  basis points over the prior year fourth quarter to a record  these results reflect an increasing number of design wins ramping into production and are expanding new product revenue combined with benefits from improved product mix and our continued focus on reducing product cost additionally we sequentially decreased operating expenses over  million in the quarter which contributed to a significant improvement in ebitda and earnings per share these results further validate our ability to achieve our goal of ebitda breakeven by middle of this year i am also pleased to report that adesto secured a record number of new design wins amounting to  in the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to  more than double the design wins secured in  in terms of total annual revenue run rate potential for our  design wins when reached to full production and as always subject to market conditions and customersâ production timelines the total dollar value opportunity also amounted to a record at  million also more than doubling when compared to  over  of  design wins were with new customers reflecting our efforts to further diversify and expand our customer base and increase our market penetration from an end market perspective for the full year approximately  of design wins were secured in industrial markets and  in consumer whereas the total dollar value opportunity was approximately  industrial and  consumer notable design wins included two new smart power meter platforms in china and japan in addition we are seeing significant activity at large tier you want consumer customers with whom we expect to be shipping to production volumes across multiple platforms later this year in short we finished  with a solid momentum that are expect to contribute to our growth in  and beyond the actual revenue breakdown in the fourth quarter by end market at our top  revenue customers consisted of  from industrial market  from consumer market and the remaining  being spread across communication medical automotive and computing with that let me take a few minutes to talk about each of our product families in more detail our dataflash family remains the largest revenue contributor reflecting our leading position in high volume smart meter market these products are ideally suited for data logging applications such as meters and are also using health and fitness tracking as well as home automation in  we began migrating our dataflash family the  ph series to  nanometer node with the first product migrated in our  megabit dataflash we provided early samples of these product in the second half of  and as ive mentioned in the past the migration to  nanometer provides a better cost structure for adesto and allows us to add new features in the product the next product that is targeted to move to  nanometer is the  megabit dataflash which we expect to take part ph in the first quarter of this year during the quarter we also continue to make progress sampling our  dataflash product that are designed specifically for the asia smart meter market these product family provides a lowercost alternative with a more constrained feature set as compared to our standard dataflash family and is more suitable for cost conscious metering and industrial market such as the ones in china turning to our fusionflash family we continue to experience increasing revenue growth for this product which are wellsuited for batteryoperated consumer devices requiring low power and extended operating life as i mentioned last quarter our fusionflash device was chosen by tile a maker of worlds best selling bluetooth tracker product these products have been ramping throughout the quarter as expected this particular customer success story exemplifies the fast ramp to production from design wins which is why we launched an initiative to focus on consumer iot markets a year ago itâs also worthwhile to look back at the fusion family in more detail because i believe it highlights one of the underlying themes of our company back in  we worked with csr which is now qualcomm to understand the issues facing bluetooth low energy system that run on a battery we identified the problem in the systems related to commodity flash memory in terms of the ability of these devices to work in a energy constraint environment we further discovered that this is not a customer specific issue but more of a broader bluetooth lowenergy application problem our fusion family was designed to solve this problem the first samples were available in late  the first design wins occurred in early  now if you look at our unit shipment we shipped less than  million units in  and in  we shipped over  million units for  we expect to double unit shipment again as compared to  as evidence by the rapid ramp in shipments fusion has become our fastestgrowing product family i believe this illustrates our company thesis and that the new era of connected devices is striving for optimized memory solutions that address specific problems facing system design wins in consumer market these are more rapidly realized while in industrial markets it takes longer to ramp from design wins now if you look at our ecoxip product family you would see similar parallel to the fusion story we introduced this product in the second half of  and expect to experience a similar ramping trend over the coming years this product family was designed in close collaboration with several leading mcu and systemonachip customers who were facing issues integrating embedded nonvolatile memory advanced node for code execution and executein place application ive mentioned on our last earnings call we launched this product in september of  and since that time have been receiving strong market acceptance early samples of ecoxip have been provided to customers and have gained validation from leading companies such as nxp who is supporting the ecoxip interface in the future mcu product we believe the total opportunity for this product family could surpass fusionflash for a few reasons first this product ramp in correlation with platforms and reference designs which are characteristics of mcu based embedded system today mcus normally top out at  to  megabit of internal flash but ip based internetofthings devices often need more cost base to support multiple protocol requiring an external flash device as well as extensive internal sram ecoxip solved this problem by delivering the performance needed for code execution with only one device ecoxip is also packed which features that are ideal for remote batteryoperated embedded systems such as concurrent read and write functionality that allows over the air updates more efficiently and with better performance our ecoxip products can be deployed in many types of iot and embedded devices including wearables medical monitors point of sales controller sensors and beacons and so on the second reason we believe ecoxip offers a potentially a higher larger revenue opportunity is because this product demands a higher asp than the fusion family as a result of the higher memory density than fusion by delivering performance and power benefits to the embedded system so even at the same level of unit ecoxip offers a higher return on revenue across broad number of targeted products and applications beyond the consumer market today the first ecoxip product is entering the market at  megabit we expect to introduce higher density ecoxip products later in  for  specifically we expect the revenue contribution from ecoxip to be modest but the expect the ramp to be more significant exiting the year into  during the quarter we introduced our new mavriq family which utilizes our cbram technology the maverick digital security series sets a new milestone for resistive ram write endurance and features hackresistant onetime programmable security registers to date adesto is the only company selling resistive ram discrete memory products with reliability features that rivals the more mature floating gate technology this latest addition to our cbram based product offers system designers lowpower operation excellent endurance and features to enable better security in iot and other connected devices the mavriq ds series performs read and write operation with up to four times less power than competitive solutions and the ultradeep power down mode uses as much as    times less power these new products also provide over hundred thousand write cycle of endurance across full temperature and voltage range additionally i mentioned last quarter that our mavriq product has been qualified on a camera module for smart phones and tablets as you know it is a very large market opportunity that we estimate to be  billion units in  and growing to more than  billion units in  today more than half of these markets contain double eeprom less than  kilobit the trend is for the market to go to   and  kilobit devices we believe this opportunity becomes more attractive for adestos mavriq family as the density requirement increase because the cbram based eeprom devices such as mavriq will become more costeffective than traditional double eeprom we are currently working to secure design wins for the application at our  the market entry point and we expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarters let me take a minute to reiterate our cbram started and go forward outlook for this industryleading devices first and as many of you know adesto is the first company to successfully commercialize a resistive ram technology having shipped millions of production parts to customers our conductive bridging ram technology is a breakthrough technology platform that overcomes a critical power barrier needed for iot edge our cbram products are adaptable for broad range of applications from medical devices and appliances to wearables and smartphone it enables  to  times less energy consumption than todays leading memory technologies without sacrificing performance and reliability we continue to believe the unit volume for our cbram product will be tied to the growth and trajectory of connected devices due to the fact that all end market applications require smart memory as well as other features that cbram offers in the past our rd focus has been to solve some of the most challenging problems that typically prohibit companies from bringing to market solutions based on a new revolutionary technology such as cbram we believe the most difficult technical challenges in the area are behind us which helped us contribute to lower rd spending in the quarter going forward we are focusing our efforts and resources on seeking nearterm revenue opportunities for cbram technologies best suited to these applicationspecific memory solution lastly in terms of our standard serial flash product family we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various high volume opportunities in computing and consumer end market we are making solid in growth in design wins with tier  odms including opportunities at leading notebook and tablet manufacturers im very pleased with the progress weve made on this product group and expect to get volume orders in the first half of  with more meaningful revenues contribution in the second half for the full year we anticipate revenue contribution from this product approach approximately  of total revenue which represent a significant underlying growth rate for the family in closing i believe we have taken proper steps over the past year to strengthen our financial position and balance sheet while focusing on driving top line revenue growth in  will be driven by an increasing number of design wins ramping into production as well as a higher contribution from new product as we expand our market share of rapidly growing iot market across a broad number of end market applications as we look more specifically in the first quarter we anticipate our revenue to reflect expected seasonality primarily from our consumer end market and the second quarter anticipated to return to strong growth and reach a new quarterly revenue record with that i will now turn the call over to ron to review the fourth quarter financial results in more detail as well as more details on our first quarter outlook ron ron shelton thanks narbeh and thanks everyone for attending our call revenue in the fourth quarter ended december  of  was  million thatâs a increase of about  from  million in the third quarter of  and a little more than  from  million in the fourth quarter of  gross margin in the fourth quarter of  was a record  thats compared to  in the third quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of  the increase in our gross margins was due primarily to a favorable product mix from the sale of higher margin products combined with continued focus on reducing product cost this quarter represents the sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin above our target model of  for  we expect gross margins to remain in the high s but on a quartertoquarter basis they may fluctuate  to  basis points longer term gross margins will continue to be supported from new products with higher valueadded content further cost reduction initiatives and migrations to the lower process nodes in addition were currently experiencing a favorable pricing environment and we anticipate the pricing pressure in  will be subdued gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter were  million thats compared to  million in the prior quarter and  million in the year ago quarter nongaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter were  million thatâs compared to  million last quarter and  million in the fourth quarter of  for the full year  we expect nongaap operating expenses to remain relatively flat when compared to the full year of  operating expenses in the quarter were well below the low end of our guidance range primarily due to a  million sequential decrease in rd spending so looking at fourth quarter nongaap opex in more detail as we previously discussed nongaap research and development expenses were  million thatâs compared with  million in the prior quarter and  million in the fourth quarter of  as narbeh previously indicated in his comments with some of the key challenges in cbram development behind us we are able to realize lower levels of research and development spending during the quarter nongaap sales and marketing expenses were  million thats compared with  million last quarter and  million in the year ago period nongaap ga expenses were  million thats compared to  million last quarter and  million in the year ago quarter stock based comp in the fourth quarter was  amortization of intangible assets was  and depreciation and amortization was  accounting for these items adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of  was nearly breakeven with a loss of  thats a significant improvement as compared to a loss of  million in the third quarter of  and a loss of  in the fourth quarter of  gaap net loss for the fourth quarter  was  million or  per share thatâs compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in third quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  fourth quarter nongaap net loss was  million or  per share thats compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in the third quarter of  and a nongaap net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  share count used to compete the fourth quarter gaa and nongaap net loss was  million shares in terms of the balance sheet we continue to show the benefits of an ongoing focus on liquidity ending the quarter with  million in cash as discussed earlier in addition the near breakeven and ebitda we experienced significant benefits from an improved balance sheet metrics furthermore we expect to increase this quarter amendments for a existing credit facility which will further enhance our liquidity inventory the fourth quarter was  million thats down from  million last quarter and we expected inventory turnover metrics will continue to improve in the coming quarters and we expect to get to our targeted terms models for that better in  accounts receivable at  million that represents a dso of approximately  days so a couple of comments before reviewing guidance for the first quarter and opening up for the questions first i want to inform our investors that we plan to file shelf registration with the sec in the coming weeks which will allow us from time to time to offer equity and debt securities under the shelf registration we donât have any immediate plans to offer a seller securities under the registration statement but believe that the matter of good business practice and provides us greater flexibility going forward to have a registration on file now let me turn to guidance for the first quarter of  we expect revenue to range between  million to  million that reflects expected seasonality primarily related to our consumer end market despite the expected seasonality our guidance at the midpoint plays yearoveryear revenue growth in q of approximately  and as narbeh mentioned we expect to return to growth and achieve record revenue in the second quarter gross margin for the first quarter is expected to range between  and  and gaap operating expenses are expected to range between  million  million with nongaap expenses between  million and  million stockbased comp in the first quarter will be approximately  amortization of intangible assets will be approximately  and depreciation and amortization will be approximately  weighted average shares outstanding are expected be approximately  million shares for the first quarter and lastly i wan to reiterate that we continue to expect to be â to ebitda breakeven in the middle of  so before opening the call to questions i just wanted to summarize out comments during this call the accomplishment from last quarter so first we did experienced record quarterly revenue since weve been public and for the first time in our history we had gross margin in excess of  there are sequential decline of  nongaap operating expenses which is ebitda of nearly breakeven we had positive cash flow from operations we saw significant improvements in our working efficiency so with that well open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from the line of gary mobley with benchmark please go ahead gary mobley hi guys thanks for taking my question i had a question about your imply guidance for the second quarter in order to achieve record quarterly revenue that implies roughly or at least  quarteroverquarter revenue growth and so i am wondering about your confidence level in achieving that what drives it is it seasonality is it a couple product cycle ramps any details that would be helpful ron shelton yes hey gary itâs ron thanks for the question i think when we talked about seasonality in the first quarter so thatâs what were seeing and then the growth in the second quarter you know then we expect revenue in the second quarter to be higher than that over the fourth quarter as is driven by a number of thins i think one those customers politically expect â experience some seasonality to start coming back off that in q there are new design wins that we expect and are ramping into q and there is some new customers that are consuming the ramp and additional new products so i think itâs a whole basket of things that are coming together and i think speeds off some of the design wins activity weve seen over the last couple of years and were starting to see that to show up in the topline  into that topline gary mobley okay and with depreciation amortization running about  per quarter in the likelihood of achieving adjusted ebitda breakeven in mid that must assume that were going to see  gross margins in q and about  revenue growth am i reading those variables right ron shelton yeah i mean you know were going to guide we mentioned in the call high s in gross margin we did a little over  this quarter and gross margin we expect to see other than that    range through the quarter and again we expect to bounce back in revenue in q higher than q and see growth and we expect to grow through the year gary mobley okay one last question on the product front should we think about you know ecoxip ph being a successor to fusion and that perhaps in some design wins bluetooth for example you might be going forward with ecoxip versus fusion or are we talking about an incremental addressable market opportunity here narbeh derhacobian hi gary itâs narbeh no its not â ecoxip is not replacement or its not going to cannibalize the fusion they are going after different market opportunities fusion we are expecting as i mentioned too actually â we are expecting the unit shipments to double in  over  and we are planning to introduce new fusion family product in the second half of the year ecoxip is target more of a companionship for mcus and kind of them as you think about it also on a density perspective ecoxip tends to be higher density fusion tends to be lower density so ecoxip is really designed in a market and applications where large amount of code is needed to make that node intelligence and over the year our data reporting interaction executing from the controller or the soc a far amount importance for that node so today you think about where that market is stated its either sales by embedded flash in older or current mcus and we believe that embedded flash gets more and more expensive as mcus are going into more advanced node and more code is needed as i mentioned in my presentation that ability to support multiple protocols the size of the memory starts to explode and with the economic stuff embedding starts not make sense thatâs where ecoxip release design to bring solutions to the embedded systems gary mobley okayâ¦ narbeh derhacobian so it will be on incremental a long answer but it would be in addition to the growth we starting to see gary mobley okay thatâs helpful congratulations on a good finish to the year thanks guys narbeh derhacobian thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of suji desilva with roth capital please go ahead suji desilva hi narbeh hi ron my y congratulations on a strong finish to the year so and the second quarter recovering strongly here can you dig a little bit deeper and talk whether theres certain end markets that help drives that recovery specifically or whether its a broadbased feed into the second quarter narbeh derhacobian its not one particular thing i think if you think about it one of our â its across the board so if you look at our big revenue contributor which is dataflash thatâs coming back out not only just in industrial market but also â we also dataflash in consumer market for data logging application fusion will kind of  is very consumeroriented so that we had â that impacted in q for the expected seasonality that also coming back and also i mentioned about some of the standard serial products that we introduced in the second half that weve been getting qualified and computing more kind of a traditional market we are expecting growth to start to ramp because that just goes through the normal cycle of qualification with the softcons ph in asia so all that is going to contribute to the growth that we are expected to see in q suji desilva okay thatâs very helpful color there and then as we look at the full year  we saw in  increase after half of a  is thatâs the typical linearity we should expect in the given year with   something very anomaly in the â where the year plays out ron shelton hey suji itâs ron i donât â its hard to say whether thatâs typical or not i think the way were seeing this year rollout is again its seasonality q its step up in q to the factors that narbeh reviewed you know beyond the q number and then kind of ebitda breakeven in the middle of the year so which implies further growth you know whether  kind of secondhalf versus first half is a standard trend i wouldnât characterize as that suji desilva okay just wondered since you now over there and then lastly are the design wins in the fourth quarter very strong after third quarter  is that the new left baseline for what you guys can do on a quarterly basis ie kind of a  design win run rate or were there some particular spike happen in the fourth quarter that was worth calling out there narbeh derhacobian yes i was sure you were going to ask that question soâ¦ suji desilva it jumped out of me narbeh narbeh derhacobian so look in the past weve also indicated that there is two things important with design wins one is the number of design wins the other one is the dollar â revenue potential of the design wins so ive also mentioned this on all the earnings call whenever weve met with investors donât be surprised that we come and report a lower numbers for design wins but the dollar content would be up because that deliberately focus in some high volume opportunities that â and that really give up higher dollar content design wins and of course those also take more time to bring home so to answer your question is we are expecting high number of design wins but i think the matrix you want to look at exactly the dollar content that wed be reporting thatâs going to be the key because thatâs a indication of the top line growth for the company suji desilva okay great thanks for that color thanks guys narbeh derhacobian thank you operator and our next question comes from line of rajvindra gill with needham and company rajvindra gill yes thanks for taking my questions and congrats as well on good results and good execution thatâs great to see a question on the eco chip business â eco chip business so narbeh you talked about that business growing kind of rapidly youre seeing a lot of low power batteryoperated products such as tile kind to use your usual power memory what other products can we think of that â that are battery operator or maybe if could characterize design that in terms driving the eco chip business going forward narbeh derhacobian the indiscernible really the fusion family right thatâs why we could see the ones that have extend the batter life of their system the ecoxip as i mentionedâ¦ rajvindra gill yes i am sorry for future products sorry about that narbeh derhacobian yes the ecoxip was introduced to be really a companion chip to use so if you think about where mcus are used in general you can think about all that this is why we call that â were excited about the opportunity because itâs more of a platform design so the business model for the ecoxip is the following in one model we would be selling the nongood dye ph to microcontroller players or systemonachip players and then they would go into their end market in another model we would be setting into a reference design for that microcontroller ourselves so the end markets for ecoxip is very broad starting with industrial market consumer and communication market as well for example one of the areas we see or we looking at an opportunity with ecoxip with that microcontroller is more of the high and fitness tracker which requires more often intelligence that we see today in some of the business trackers which are out there so my point in pilot  making a pilot between the fusion and ecoxip was the following is that you know if we were sitting down and when fusion was first interviewed we would be asking the questions where is the revenue where are the design wins why is the design wins ramping into production in  so we went from introducing the is used in the product in  to having some design wins in  and went from  million units shipped for the whole of  to  million in  and  expected to be over  million so my point is that this growth of application specific memory that require design wins and then ramp is unlike your commodity situation where you know end market and you are going â digging based on price and youre ramping so we are expecting ecoxip to experience similarly if not better ramp that we probably saw with fusion because itâs a more of a platform play rather than specifically in case of fusion with the bluetooth lowenergy sort of winter rajvindra gill so just going back to fusion youre seeing growth of these low power batteryoperated products such as the tile what other kind of products are you seeing in the marketplace that are â these iot connected devices that are batteryoperated they donât need to have very low power and a small footprint compared to traditional delivery services narbeh derhacobian so bluetooth headset think about bluetooth and battery and chances that we are â they are target markets or our current fusion opportunity so bluetooth headset bluetooth remote control as you know remote controls are getting more intelligence they requiring more codes bluetooth speakers so you know thatâs the â itâs quite broad where bluetooth is used in terms of end markets rajvindra gill so the other question i have and ill hop back in queue as it is more of a broader question but you know our view is that embedded flash with microcontroller is going to have difficult in scaling below  nanometer and the major microcontroller companies like nxci ph which you have a relationship with micro chip et cetera are going to seek alternatives to embedded flash and possibly use your eco chip or which does the rewrite cycles concurrently and generate less power can you talk a little bit about the timing of that the inflection point of that and whats been the conversation like with the microcontrollers players as they start to confirm this reality thank you narbeh derhacobian yes so depending on the microcontroller company you can see its â there is certain microcontroller players are very successfully are in the market with more â if you think about not at the leading edge of indiscernible lagging that more of a k sort of microcontroller that day they are embedded flash solutions that they use at  nanometer  nanometer even  nanometer  nanometer node some of the other microcontrollers players which are more focused on  bit microcontrollers they are more â passing more source of it course in the mcu all migrating to  and below and exactly what you said it becomes extremely expensive to embed flash in mcus at  and below node and those are our target markets when they are going to ramp off we provided samples to some of the players in this space so there you can see is an soc we re expecting to get  from our perspective we are expecting to some modest revenue on ecoxip in  but the big lump for us is going to start in  and beyond and i am expecting that will be driven by the events we use also ramping in volume at their end so i think by extension the ramp for mcus would be around that product beyond that product rajvindra gill okay great thank you congrats again operator and our next question comes from the line of rick schafer with oppenheimer please go ahead josh buchalter hello this is josh buchalter on behalf of rick congratulations on to solid end to the year you know mentioned that there is lower investment in cbram that led to the opex decline in the fourth quarter and i guess i was wondering if you could â and you also mentioned that opex should be flat yearoveryear in  yes i was wondering if you could talk to maybe how you view investing for growth while also managing profitability with the ebitda breakeven and kind of how your thoughts are on opex going forward ron shelton so we as an innovator we must invest to grow in absolute investing rd to grow and thatâs an absolute month for us so if you look at the history of cbram when we first took this technology to market years ago our main goal was first take the technology from research mode and take it to the market which we did and we were fully expecting that we were going to have issues in the market with the technology that we have to fix and over the years one by one our rd group has not found these challenges and today with the latest introduction of an average ph which we made in q we clearly have nothing to or make excuses around how reliable the technologies and how much benefit it brings in the area that it shines which is performance and power over todays solution so having said that that means that trying to solve this technical challenges which is a big part of our ip by the way now we do not need to invest as significantly as we have in the past to continue and maintain and bring products to market based on that the most expensive part of rd for any silicon company is the silicon itself you know designed especially for us which we are not that  our products are not that leading edge of moores law our design rd expenses our mass rd expenses are not as much as what you view in some of the microprocessor or soc companies so the most expensive part of rd for us is that now we are lacking the market opportunity that we see in front of us are going to drive our rd resources to the direction where we can continue to innovate and yet we can eye on managing the offer josh buchalter thank you thatâs helpful and then i was hoping you could comment on the competitive environment weve seen the headline recently that a major nor flash player is looking to deemphasize the business and you also mentioned that the pricing environment is been better so i was hoping if you could just maybe comment on how youre â how itâs looking when youre going up against sockets and how you little bit secured metal pricing ron shelton yes so that absolutely right we saw that and in fact a year ago we were mentioning that the nor landscape is to going to change especially the nor market that we are focusing into are more low density nor and showing off â there is one of the major players has announced end up like for low density products which are market where we compete in so that and also capacity for indiscernible were seeing that prices are also beginning to firm up in the market and it creates two things for us so the number one we have a standard flash family which directly competes with a standard nor player but more importantly our value added solutions such as the fusion and ecoxip and dataflash in cases that in the past i mentioned where we do lose an opportunity because you know the customer believes that the premium that we ask for our products giving us a bit gross margin may not necessarily make economic sense for them that equation is beginning to fade or more towards us now because prices are also firming up so i think itâs a good thing i also believe that big volume in iot from a flash perspective is not the iot that we focus in the edge of iot is not the related to nand flash its really mid to low density nor which our populating these connected small node and i think in general itâs a much more favorable environment for us than previous year josh buchalter thank you thatâs helpful and congratulations again ron shelton thanks josh operator and our next question is from the line of aaron martin with aigh investment partners aaron martin hi ron hi narbeh congratulations on the quarter most of my questions have been â most of the question have answered but a thing i wanted to ask you within your design wins metrics with ipo i am helpless i guess to understand that how that â the time line is in design wins to revenue there has been tremendous growth obviously in design wins which hasnât shown up in the revenue so help me understand when that will transit to revenue growth ron shelton well i think some of that aaron its not there â i think some of that has shown up i think it was the last earnings call when we did look at some of our  kind of  design wins i believe and  design wins what we saw two things number one we asked the question has customer that it has pulled out the design wins have they come back and said look they are not ramping their product and nothing that was significant in terms of volume and dollar content for us appears which means the customers have either delayed or they have issues around it so ill give you an example we have amgen as a customer he called the design wins two years ago and i think we have a very young investor on the callâ¦ aaron martin he is excited as i am narbeh derhacobian okay and so they had some issues and that particular opportunity that we were going after by the other design wins is software and fda approval and thatâs been delayed delayed delayed so thatâs taken over two years and were seeing nothing in production and not even in our forecast now because of all the delay on the other hand company like tile went from design wins to production in six months aaron martin maybe thatâs discussion differently over the last you know quarter or two would you look at the revenue that came in when was those design wins based ron shelton hey aaron itâs ron itâs a good question i think the  some for example you know tile being one would have been within the last year others that are sitting in there indiscernible is our biggest customer could have been over the last two or three years right i mean so itâs going to vary by each individual customer and each individual program so i wish i could give you more granularity in terms of when these things hit but i just donât have that information in front of me narbeh derhacobian you know one of the difficulties we have in answering this clearly that percentage is a follow on we have an existing customer such as our smart meter customers that took new design wins with their new dataflash family if the customer â the customer also buys through distribution so from us after we secure the design wins the product is shifted to the distributor and then it goes to the customers and system the customer has an existing program already running on the same part number not in new design wins so i am designing from years few years ago that uses the same part number so from our perspective were kind of lying and seeing this particular part that were shipping to the distributor is going to the old design wins or the new design wins i mean we do see fluctuation it could be rising but it is rising because of old design win is ramping or is it rising because the old design win is buying the range of new design wins and this why we have scenarios where we can actually call it out we do call it out and in some area it becomes a little bit readiness for us to specifically say that aaron martin okay i guess thatâs it from me all the questions have been answered congratulations on the tremendous progress narbeh derhacobian thanks aaron operator and i am showing any further questions in the queue i will like to turn the call back to narbeh derhacobian for final remarks narbeh derhacobian thank you all for joining us today i am pleased with our performance across our business throughout the fourth quarter and we expect definitely through the second half  and we believe our growing base of design wins will continue to drive the growth in  as a reminder we will be

on product development efforts that would support our future growth i will then turn the call over to ron to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail as well as our fourth quarter guidance before opening the call for questionsrevenue in the third quarter was  million which was at the high end of our guidance range of  million to  million our continued focus on securing design wins has begun to show evidence of success additionally gross margin was  in the quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter above our target model of  also during the quarter we continued to make notable progress on our design win momentum across our end markets achieving a record  design wins in the quarter and bringing our ninemonth total to in terms of the total annual revenue run rate potentials for our q design wins when reached to full production and as always subject to market conditions and customers production time lines the total dollar value opportunity also amounted to a quarterly record of  million or  million for the nine months of  this compares to  million for all of last year and  million for the full year  almost  of these third quarter design wins were with new customers reflecting our efforts to further diversify our customer base and increase our market penetrationfrom an end market perspective approximately  of the third quarter design wins were in industrial markets  in consumer and  communications and the remaining  in automotive medical and computing similar to the trend we have seen in the past the consumer market represented the largest portion of the total dollar value opportunity in q at the  of the total  million with industrial representing  or approximately  as i mentioned earlier our efforts to further expand into the highvolume consumer market is showing evidence of success in our resultswe continue to have a growing number of design win ramps into production at leading consumer manufacturers including those for advanced remote controls wireless beacons bluetooth low energy headsets programmable electronic toys in industrial market design wins included new smart meter platforms with our leading metering customer as well as instrumentation and industrial control applications in terms of a breakdown of our third quarter revenue by end market and looking at our top  revenue earners the industrial market represented  of the revenue the consumer market  and the remaining  being spread across communication medical automotive and computingwith that let me take a few minutes to talk about each of our product families in more detail our dataflash family remains the largest revenue contributor reflecting our leading position in the high volume smart meter and other industrial markets during the quarter we continued to make progress sampling our latest family of dataflash products specifically designed for the smart meter market in china and are actively engaged with customers as is expected in industrial markets it may take some time to ramp these products at the end customers we are nevertheless very excited about the long term opportunity for this product in china markets as we are

aheadnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director thank you leanne and good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today i will begin with a brief overview of our financial results then address our design win pipeline on product development efforts that would support our future growth ill then turn the call over to ron to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail as well as our fourth quarter guidance before opening the call for questionsrevenue in the third quarter was  million which was at the high end of our guidance range of  to  million our continued focus on securing design wins has begun to show evidence of success additionally gross margins was  in the quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter above our target model of read morealso during the quarter we continued to make notable progress on our design win momentum across our end markets achieving a record  design wins in the quarter and bringing our ninemonth total to in terms of the total annual revenue run rate potentials for our q design wins  when reached to full production and as always subject to market conditions and customers production time lines the total dollar value opportunity also amounted to a quarterly record of  million or  million for the nine months of  this compares to  million for all of last year and  million for the full year almost  of these third quarter design wins were with new customers reflecting our efforts to further diversify our customer base and increase our market penetration from an in market perspective approximately  of the third quarter design wins were in industrial markets  in consumer and  communications and the remaining  in automotive medical and computingsimilar to the trend weve seen in the past the consumer market represented the largest portion of the total dollar value opportunity in q at the  of the total  million with industrial representing  or approximately  as i mentioned earlier our efforts to further expand into the highvolume consumer market is showing evidence of success in our resultswe continue to have a growing number of design win ramps into production at leading consumer manufacturers including those for advanced remote controls wireless beacons bluetooth low energy headsets programmable electronic toys in industrial market design wins included new smart meter platforms with our leading metering customer as well as instrumentation and industrial control applicationsin terms of a breakdown of our third quarter revenue by inmarket and looking at our top  revenue earners the industrial market represented  of the revenue the consumer market  and the remaining  being spread across communication medical automotive and computingwith that let me take a few minutes to talk about each of our product families in more detail our dataflash family remains the largest revenue contributor reflecting our leading position in the high volume smart meter and other industrial marketsduring the quarter we continued to make progress sampling our latest family of dataflash products specifically designed for the smart meter market in china and are actively engaged with customers as is expected in industrial markets it may take some time to ramp these products at the incustomers we are nevertheless very excited about the long term opportunities for these product in china markets as we are seeing more sampling activityturning to our fusion family we continue to gain increased traction for this product which are well suited for battery operated consumer devices requiring low power and extended battery life as we indicated last quarter our fusion family device was chosen by tile a maker of best selling bluetooth tracker product the tile slim and the tile mate these personal tracking devices help users locate anything within a range of  feet by communicating with a smartphone or any other ios or android devicememory can play a key role in determining the usability and lifetime of ultra slim and ultra low power products like tile products and serve as a perfect example of how adestos fusion family memory can play a critical role in improving the power and performance of these connected battery operated deviceswe continue to believe that for these edge of iot notes application specific memory solutions such as fusion offer a better alternative than commodity memory devices that were designed for previous eraswe have been talking about our newest family ecoxip over the last year im pleased to say that weve formally launched this product on schedule in september this new executing placed non volatile memory replaces expensive energy and efficient architectures and sets a new standard for performance cost and powerful iot edge devicesecoxip was designed from ground up in close collaboration with leading microcontroller and systemonachip suppliers to be the ultimate solution for the main program memory in an intelligence iot systemand ive indicated in our september release we have earned the validation of nxp whos supporting the ecoxip interface in their future microcontroller product we have also been engaged with the entire eco system from it suppliers such as synopsys to standards committees to prepare for the launch of this new devicewe are seeing that more companies are recognizing how adestos ecoxip memory enables designers to increase the memory throughput in code execution and system performance thereby improving the end users experience were currently sampling a  megabit ecoxip device with selected customers with a family of expanded densities planned for the futurewe expect to enter full volume production in the first half of  with the current device over the last quarter we continued to sample mavriq across many applications such as bluetooth connected devices  like audio headsets cameras and keyboards  primarily in wpan like applicationsone such area that we are excited about and have been qualified for is in a camera module for phones and tablets we expect to make more progress in this end market in the coming quartersalso during the quarter our second product in the cbram family  moneta  was named a finalist for the internet product innovation award at elektra  which will be held in london england in decemberproducts or reference designs nominated for the award were judged not only on the performance day time technical capabilities but also how product provides true innovation in the application of iot we are very pleased with this recognition adesto is gaining across our product portfolio as customers on industry acknowledge the value we offerweve spoken about our standard serial flash product family in the previous calls as i had mentioned we increased our activity around this product group as an extension of our strategy to pursue higherunitvolume opportunities and further diversify our customer base and revenue in the second quarter we introduced four new standard serial flash products covering densities from  meg to  megabit volt and volt partsover this past quarter we have gained significant traction with these products in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various opportunities in computing and consumer end markets were excited about seeing these prospects progress into design wins as some are higher volume opportunities in q odmsincluded in the list of new opportunities are leading notebook and tablet manufacturers and we expect to get volume orders in the first half of  i am very pleased with the progress we have made on this product group and expect these products to contribute meaningful revenue in in closing as we look to the fourth quarter we expect to maintain our positive momentum and based on the midpoint of our guidance we are on track to meet our target of growing second half revenue by  over the first halfwe continue to gain increasing design win momentum and are seeing evidence of our success to target high volume high dollar value opportunities in consumer markets i believe our ramping design wins will continue to drive growth in  with additional contribution expected from our standard serial  products as well as our recently introduced ecoxipwith that i will now turn the call over to ron to review the financial results in more detail as well as more details on our fourth quarter outlookron shelton adesto technologies corp  cfo secretary thanks narbeh and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoonim going to spend just a few minutes reviewing the actual results for q and then well talk a little about guidance for q revenue in the third quarter was  million thats up  sequentially when compared to the  million in second quarter of  and thats slightly higher than the  million we reported in  in the third quarter of gross margins in the third quarter were  that compares to  last quarter and  in the same quarter last year and the increase in margins this quarter is due primarily to the shift in in product manufacturing to higher margin products gaap operating expenses in the third quarter were  million thats compared to  million in the second quarter and  million in the prior year quartercosts associated with our cbram technology development in the  in the third quarter was about  higher than our prior forecast we expect those costs to moderate going forward and as a result we expect overall operating expenses to trend slightly down in the fourth quarternongaap operating expenses in the third quarter were  million thats compared to  million in the second quarter and  million in the third quarter of looking at gaap opex in more detail rd expenses were  million thats compared to  million last quarter and  million in the third quarter of  and the increase in yearoveryear rd spending reflect primarily higher spending on our cbram technology development effortssales and marketing expenses in the current quarter were  million thats compared with  million in the second quarter and  million in the third quarter of last year the yearoveryear increase was driven largely by higher personnel costs as we fully staffed our sales and marketing groupsga expenses this quarter were  millionthats down slightly from the  million in the second quarter of  and  in the third quarter of  the yearoveryear increase in ga primarily reflects our transition to a public company and the costs associated with that stockbased comp in the third quarter was  and amortization of intangible assets was accounting for all these items adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was a negative of  million thats a  improvement when compared to a negative ebitda of  million in the second quarter of  for the third quarter of  we reported negative ebitda of gaap net loss for the third quarter of  was  million or  per share thats compared to a loss of  million or  per share in the second quarter of  and a loss of  million or  a share in the third quarter of  gaap net loss was calculated using  million shares for the second and third quarters of  and  shares for the third quarter of third quarter nongaap net loss was  million or  per share thats compared to a loss of  million or  per share last quarter and a loss of  million or  per share in the third quarter of in addition we continue to show the benefits of an ongoing focus on our balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million in cash and shortterm investments in addition during the quarter we closed on a  million senior secured debt facility and that replaced our existing april  facilityas expected inventory in the third quarter was  million thats down from  million last quarter and our expectation going forward is that inventory turn over metrics will continue to improve in the coming quartersaccounts receivable is  million and that represents a day sales outstanding of  days now let me turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter of  as we indicated in our last conference call and as narbeh mentioned we expect revenue in the second half of  to grow approximately  when compared to the first half of the year and were reaffirming that guidance today we currently expect revenue in the fourth quarter to range between  million and  milliongross margins are expected to be between  and  and gaap operating expenses are expected to range between  million and  million with nongaap expenses between  million and  millionstockbased comp in the fourth quarter will be approximately  amortization of intangible assets will be approximately  and da  depreciation and amortization will be approximately finally weighted average shares outstanding are expected to increase to approximately  million shares for the fourth quarter and thats up  million in the third quarter of  the increase is due to the vesting of approximately  used that we granted one year ago and those become available for sale beginning november stwith that well open the call to questionsquestions and answersoperator thank youoperator instructionsour first question comes from rick schafer oppenheimer company your line is openjosh buchalter the oppenheimer company  analyst this is josh buchalter on for rick and congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my questionso i was wondering if you could characterize the solid growth this quarter and the guide if there were one or two particular verticals that drove it more so than others to help us understand the quartertoquarter splitnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director yes so hi josh so yes the  as we mentioned during the call weve  about a year ago we started to focus on high volume consumer markets especially with the fusion family and it was deliberate because we felt that the kind of the high volume opportunities in iot market for and the fastest advance to ramp would be these markets versus industrial which is we do have a strong baseso primarily what we said during the last call about the  growth and what we we have found now and also for the fourth quarter is just the growth drivers are in the consumer market we do see as we also mentioned continued strength in our  in our industrial sector as well so its no surprise that those two markets are the key drivers for usjosh buchalter the oppenheimer company  analyst ok thank you and then i was wondering if you could help us better understand what types of applications more specifically cbram and ecoxip are gaining traction with initially and what sort of contribution can we expect in the next couple of quartersnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director as before in the cbram  technologies so the two products based on cbram and how we can monitor and we mentioned the traction for mavriq is really double pram replacement today in primarily consumer bluetooth low energy devices not necessarily as a flash memory replacement but a double pram replacementas i mentioned during the call we are seeing an interesting opportunity  very high volume opportunity for cbram were not ready to call this a design win as of yet but for mavriq family we have been sampling and qualified in the memory of device for camera modules thats used in smart phones and tablets and so forthand its a pretty high volume opportunity were not again ready to talk a lot of details on that as i mentioned during the call we hope that to move through its normal progression of going down into the designing and through production in the pipelineecoxip is an interesting product because the first market for ecoxip we believe is a systemin package sort of as a device that will be attached to another controller and sold as an in one package and we talked about the press release mentioned nxp as one of the early adopters herehaving said that you can see that the applicability of this product goes across the different verticals because its essentially it goes where the endfield is heading and we believe again that the big opportunities there will be consumer and industrial again same  because thats if you think about embedded systems where microcontrollers are used those are the two verticals that are commonly going tojosh buchalter the oppenheimer company  analyst thanks so last one for me i know you mentioned you were going to maybe focus on some more of the standard serial flash and that might impact the margin but you know  if that didnt seem to develop is there anything that you can point to that  thats been driving the gross margin of performance for the last couple quarters and should we continue to expect thatnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director ill take a crack at it and ill let ron talk about it so always you know  we always you know if you look at our product portfolio we have products at lower margins and we have products at higher margins but we we try to guide the business to a certain corporate blend that target both marginsso you will not necessarily  whatever we do if the product makes us that we sell we would see some variations that youve seen for example in this case it ended up to be slightly higher than what we were targeting just so happens that we shipped more at the higher margin versus the lower margin one the standards here of flash products we introduced these are products that are going into more mature markets like computing and so forth and i mentioned notebooks and tablets and there  in order to get to full ram production you need to go through a standard very well established set of proceduresyou need to get samples qualified by the motherboard manufacturers be qualified at the oem in asia so were going through this check list of processes and we expect the products that were introduced in media this year to start contributing to revenue in q but also more tangible ones in but were tracking a lot of high volume opportunities as you can imagine from  if youre looking at notebooks and tablets and pcsron shelton adesto technologies corp  cfo secretary hey hey josh this is ron just to  to add on to that i think more specifically in this quarter and narbeh touched on some of the design wins ramping into production and those were really fusion based products you know which are really targeted for low power applicationsand and those generally have a higher margin than certainly standard products so we had a shift in mix there was a higher percentage of the fusion products for this quarter so that drove gross margins up higherjosh buchalter the oppenheimer company  analyst ok thanks and thats very helpful and congratulations on the progressoperator thank you our next question comes from gary mobley of benchmark your line is opengary mobley the benchmark company llc  analyst hi guys hi leanne how are you i just wanted to start asking some questions about  i know youre not going to give any specific guidance on the revenue for but if you could  could you at least speak about the puts and takes with respect to the seasonality in the first part of the year versus the second part and how that perhaps might be offset by early stages of design with rams and general just organic growthnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director yea so one of the things we saw in beginning of this year as you can  as you remember we had some customers pushing things up but also had some slower rams due to chinese new year coming back so were taking some of that into account in in looking at and so we are expecting clearly were expecting for the year  were expecting growth and well talk more about that later but i think we based on the kind of  we we may take a little bit of seasonality into account on how were going to guide and forecast going in the year but clearly all the design wins that we mentioned in the past specially our focus in the consumer high volume applications were seeing that those things are going into productionso contributions from those as we saw this quarter and expected to see in q well continue to see in the first half and definitely looks like from our portfolio and our profile second half will also see that in maybe even a stronger waygary mobley the benchmark company llc  analyst ok ron i dont think that you mentioned a cash flow number for the quarter what was it for the quarter what do you expect in terms of cash burn for q and how much of your debt facility has been tapped in other words whats the borrowing capacity and what could the gross cash you know go up to as a maximumron shelton adesto technologies corp  cfo secretary yea so those  those are all good questions so  so the  in in july we we refinanced debt that we had on the balance sheet at that point in time so we brought on incrementally about another  million of cashso if i proformatted that out from last quarter we ended the quarter with  million and added about  million to  million in cash so that would have taken it up to  million and we ended the quarter at  million so thats how this quarter played out and i think one of the things were doing and and i mentioned it in my comments is is focusing on you know some of the balance sheet metricsso you saw inventory come down you saw our dso come down to  days so that certainly helpful in terms of operating cash flow going forward the debt service going forward just to give you a sense on  is about  million this quarterso well service the debt and then were going to manage the rest of the business were going to have a ebitda loss or be ebitda negative in q but we think we can manage cash too and when you take into account working capital and everything else to about  million at a decrease of  million and that includes the debt servicein terms of the facility itself there are two components one was a  million term loan and one was a  million revolving line of credit at the end of september they both had been tapped so all the way up to the  million the  million starting to amortize like i just mentioned at about  million a quarterso theres no additional borrowing capacity right now on those lines nor do we think we need any we think we will get to ebitda to break even and weve communicated this in the past sometimes somewhere in the middle of next year so at this point in time we dont think we need any additional borrowing capacitygary mobley the benchmark company llc  analyst ok all right thats it for me thanks guysoperator our next question is from robert martin of needham  company your line is openunidentified participant needham  company  analyst hi and thank you for taking my question im here on behalf of rajvi gill you spoke earlier to the growing design win pipeline and that many of the design wins are coming from new customers is there particular segment that youre seeing particularly strong with these winsnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director hi robert yea like we mentioned  if you look at the  you know maybe the key thing would be if you focus on the dollar content of the design wins because sometimes the number may be misleading but if you look at the dollar content of the design win the  for q  of the dollar content of the design wins came from consumerand  came from industrial markets and  from the rest but if you look at the number of the design wins the actual number  were industrial  were consumer so you can see the strength if you want to qualify the strength from having high volume opportunities its coming from the consumer sideand in general you know a rule of thumb for our products is that typically the industrial market would have more of the higher asb so with that combination we can see that theres a lot of interest in in in  on the consumer side for our  for our products so i would say thatunidentified participant needham  company  analyst great thanks thats helpful and and just one more question real quick could you speak towards your smart metering initiative a little bit more and what traction youre seeing therenarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director so smart metering has been historically a very strong revenue generator for us i think we have products here that are preferred by the smart meter vendors significantly especially our data flash familywhat we did  we decided to create a family of products for more kind of cost sensitive markets within the smart meter which focusing in china so that family is our at family which we introduced and what weve done now is basically gone into china and were looking at  were currently sampling various smart metering opportunities therewe do sell in that market today with our at family our data flash family but the at we believe is at the price point where we should be able to get a much larger number of sockets in that market but as i mentioned the industrial market especially smart meter markets are long time from sampling to design win to full production so were basically going through that phase right nowunidentified participant needham  company  analyst great thanks thats very helpful thats all for meoperator thank you operator instructionsthank you im showing no further questions at this time so ill turn the comments back over to narbeh derhacobian for any closing remarksnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corp  cofounder ceo president director thank you thank you all for joining us today before we conclude todays

president and ceo thank you leanne welcome to everyone joining us today as highlighted in our press release today i am pleased with our execution in the first quarterwith the revenue at high end upper guidance operating expenses below guidance where it was below guidance enabling us to be well on track to achieve our target at ebitda breakeven and by middle of the yearentering the second quarter we are excited to see a strong backlog and bookings in our business driven by design wins that are ramping into production across our customer baseread moreadditionally we had another strong quarter of new design wins in which we secured over  design wins totaling an annual revenue runway potential of  million of course assuming design wins reaching full production and its always subject to market conditions this continued momentum of new opportunities should help to secure our expected growth in the second half of  and into from an end market perspective approximately  of the design wins were secured in the industrial market while consumer markets represented approximately  of the winsnotable design wins included a high volume smart lighting application as well as wins for communication modules in personal computing devices and a highvolume smart home applicationi had also indicated previously that we started an initiative to focus on large tier  odms to secure highvolume revenue opportunities for our products and im happy to indicate that in q  we secured design wins with several such customers in computing and communication end marketsthese customers are utilizing multiple adesto products across different applications demonstrating the increasing content and the breath of opportunities we have across our client baseas a direct result of our focus on diversifying and expanding our customer base over twothirds of the design wins in the first quarter with new customersanother key initiative for us has been to further diversify our business beyond our stronghold in the industrial market into markets where the duration from design win to production shorter and represents higher volume opportunitiesin the first quarter we had success along these lines as well of the top  design wins secured in the first quarter ranked by annual dollar value approximately half are in consumer market and the other half in computingone of our biggest assets is our large and top tier customer base we supply our customers in a variety of ways including direct through distribution fulfillment houses and through contract manufacturershence as i indicated previously its not a trivial task to trace accurately design win conversion wins into production the last several quarters we have put forth efforts to identify cases where we can clearly track design wins through the channel and into mass production with the end customers and id like to share this data with youlooking at the design wins in  that could be traced clearly in the channel and into production we can say that approximately twothirds of them have started to ramp into production some are early in their production and some have ramped as expectedas we progress through the year additional design wins was also beginning ramping into production layering onto this growing pipeline of revenue generating designs this is encouraging as it validates our investment and focus on expanding our base to support our growth profile as evidenced by our expectations for the second quarterin terms of our top  revenue customers in the first quarter the revenue breakdown by end market consisted of  from industrial market  from consumer market and the remaining  is spread across communication medical automotive and computingexamples of applications that are currently in volume production at these customers includes smart meters as our largest customer universal remotes personal tracking devices streaming tv and media player and many otherswith that let me take a few minutes to talk about some of our product families in more detail in the first quarter we taped out our nm version of our mb dataflash familythis is a follow up tape out at nanometer as we taped out at mb dataflash last year as we communicated to you this is a cost reduction initiative for our dataflash familywe will be sampling these products with our leading industrial customers for the rest of the year and into  also during the quarter we continue to make progress sampling our at dataflash products that are designed specifically for the asia smart meter marketas ive mentioned previously this is product family that offers limited feature set alternative targeting china smart meter customers and is more suitable for the costconscious metering and industrial markets such as the ones in chinawe continue to monitor market demand for dataflash to see the need for densities beyond  and mb at advance notes and will roll out those efforts into our planning when appropriate we have close working relationships with our metering and industrial customers and always align our development efforts with our partners product roadmapsturning to our fusion family we continue to generate increasing revenue and interest for this product as i mentioned last quarter this product family had experienced a rapid ramping shipments becoming one of our fasted growing linesas many of you know our existing portfolio are fusion flash products range from kb to mb in order to expand these offerings we have focused our development efforts on additional densities starting with mb mb and mb which we expect to tape out in the fourth quarter we expect to sample these additional densities in midlooking at our ecoxip product family we also continue to make solid progress on our development and sampling activities engineering samples of our mb device have been provided to our early customers and partnersthe broader rollup of this product will occur in the fourth quarter and in  we have started design activity of mb ecoxip and expect to tape out this product this quarter the mb version of the ecoxip will be taped out later this yearby mid we believe we should have mb mb and mb versions of the ecoxip in various levels of silicon sampling and hopefully in production with some of our early partners our ecoxip products can be deployed in many types of iot and embedded devices including wearables medical monitors pos controllers sensors and beaconsleading mcu and systemonchip customers such as nxpqualcomm are among the early designing customers industry leaders believe that as soc and mcus move to nm and below embedding non volatile memory functionality becomes extremely expensiveecoxip offers an ideal solution for such cases where performance cost and power characteristics of an ecoxip device as a systeminpackage becomes an attractive alternative to todays solutionslast quarter we also tapedout a version of our mavriq family designed for the camera module per plan this is kb serial nonvolatile memory device thats ideally suited for this growing marketwe believe this is a very large market opportunity for adesto and well be actively engaged with customers and contract manufacturers to assess their specific needs while also furthering seeding the marketthis opportunity becomes even more attractive as the density requirements increase in the coming years because the mavriq platformbase devices are more cost effective than alternative eeprom which are used today we continue to work toward securing design wins for this application and expect to make notable progress into this market over the coming quarterslastly in terms of standard serial flash product family we continue to gain significant traction with this product in terms of sampling and getting qualified in various highvolume opportunities for notebooks and tablets as well as consumer end marketsduring the first quarter we secured notable design wins for highvolume smart lighting applications with a leading soc company this particular design win is ramping into production this year we have also secured design wins in a wearables application with a global navigation and variable technology companyas many of you recall we began increasing our investment activity around this product group in the third quarter of  as an extension of our strategy to pursue higher unit volumes and faster ramping opportunities to further diversify our customer base and revenuesince that time we have made notable progress with customers as well as expansion of our product offerings across densities these products have helped drive additional revenue opportunities near term as the result of the shorter design cycles by also broadening our footprint with customersas i mentioned last quarter we anticipate revenue contribution from these products to approach approximately  exiting the year which will represents a significant underlying growth rate for this timein summary we look to the second quarter the combination of design wins ramping into production and continued traction with new products is driving our expectation for strong growth with revenue projected to grow  yearoveryearentering q we have record bookings and backlogs and we are seeing this trend continue as we progress through the quarter this sets the stage for continued momentum across our end markets and product families in the second half of this yearwith that i will now turn the call over to ron to review the first quarter financial results in more detail as well as more details on our second quarter outlook ronron shelton adesto technologies corporation  cfo thanks narbeh and thanks everyone for joining today revenue in the first quarter ended march   was  million and that was at the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of approximately  from the  million in the first quarter of last year and it was down seasonally  from  million last quartergross margin in the first quarter was  as compared to  in the first quarter of  and  last quarter gross margins continue to remain at the high end of our longterm model and reflect the fact that the market continues to embrace the value added differentiated solutions we provide the slight decline sequentially in gross margin was due to primary to product mix and the impacted of fixed costs on a lower revenue basewe continue to expect gross margins to remain near  but on a quarter to quarter basis they may fluctuate approximately  to  basis points longer term gross margins will continue to be supported by new products with higher value added content continued cost reduction initiatives and migration to lower process notes in addition we continue to experience a favorable pricing and competitive environment and anticipated pricing pressure in  will remain subduedgaap operating expenses in the first quarter were  million as compared to  million in the prior year quarter and that quarter included a gain of  million from a settlement with the former foundry suppliergaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter of  were  million on a nongaap basis operating expenses in the first quarter were  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the prior quarter for the full year  we expect nongaap opex to remain relatively flat when compared to now looking at first quarter nongaap opex in more detail rd expenses were  million as compared to  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the prior quarterwe continue to focus our resources on several market opportunities that we believe can have a more near term revenue contribution and thats resulted in lower rd expendituresnongaap sales and marketing expenses were  million as compared to  million in the year ago period and  million last quarter nongaap ga expenses were  million as compared to  million in the year ago quarter and  million last quarter stock base comp in the first quarter was  amortization of intangible assets was  and depreciation in amortization was accounting for these items adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  was a loss of  million as compared to a loss of  million in the first quarter of  and a loss of  last quartergaap net loss for the first quarter was  million or  per share as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of first quarter nongaap net loss was  million so  per share as compared to net loss of  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a net loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  share count used to compute the fourth quarter gaap and nongaap net loss was  million sharesin terms of balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million in cash inventory at the end of the quarter was  million thats down from  million last quarter our inventory metrics have continued to improve over last year and this quarter exceeded our targeted turns of x accounts receivable was  million that represents a dso of approximately every  daysnow with respect to guidance for the second quarter of  we currently expect to achieve a record revenue level ranging between  million to  millionat the midpoint this implies year over year revenue growth of  gross margin for the second quarter is expected to range between  and  gaap operating expenses are expected to range between  million and  million and nongaap operating expenses between  million and  millionstock base comp in the second quarter will be approximately  amortization of intangible assets will be approximately  and depreciation and amortization will be approximately  weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately  million shares in the second quarterso before opening the call of questions id like to summarize my comments and operating objectives first we continue to control operating expenses and demonstrate leverage in our operating model second we expect to grow revenue in the second quarter by  over the prior year period and set a new quarterly record third we are on track to achieve our target of ebitda breakeven by the middle of the year fourth we have direct access to additional working capital exceeded with our recently filed shelf offering which has been declared effective by the sec and lastly we remain focus on winning more designs and new customers in the months aheadwith that well open the call to questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructionsour first question comes from gary mobley of benchmark your line is opengary mobley benchmark  analyst good afternoon gentlemen congrats on a strong quarter and a strong guide a question about the pricing environment i think its been pretty well documented that some of your more commodity or competitors or comparables over in taiwan had been raising prices and experiencing tight supply and its also my understanding that you guys have preterm and pricing schedules with customers so how has this overall pricing environment impacted you is it a situation where your asps are falling slower than expected or is it helping your design win traction as an alternative to these commodity memories since it might be more price comparablenarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo hi gary its narbeh its more  the effect for us is more of the latter so as i mentioned previously when we do engage with our customer on applications with specific solutions the alternative for the customer is always to go the commodity route and of course we have to offer enough value with our solutions and ask a premium over the commodity that is just enough so the economics make sense for the customerso when prices are firming up on commodity devices with the types of more in securing design wins which is good for us because as you know this become more sticky design wins the effect were seeing today in terms of more immediate guides on where we ended up the quarter like you said is in part negotiating with the customers in the past and this recent price stability with the commodity supplier is not really affecting us that muchgary mobley benchmark  analyst okay as it relates to the supply environment or tight supply environment or flash are you affected at all by perhaps some extremely utilization rates with some of your foundry partnersnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo thats always a concern obviously when you have supply tightening the market and you know weve seen this before and we work very closely with our suppliers at various level and just to ensure that you know we can deliver to the customers so we are aware of it and just like any of the other memory suppliers are and we are on top of it and right now were not seeing any major concerns from that partgary mobley benchmark  analyst okay thats it for me thanks for taking my question guysnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo sureoperator our next question comes from suji desilva of roth capital your line is opensuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst hi narbeh hi ron congratulations on the strong results and guidance here so as we look at s growth we would be expecting do you think it comes more from the consumer side more from the industrial side or is it fairly balanced out or is there seasonality therenarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo you mean for the rest of the yearsuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst correctnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo well i tell you its broadbased for us i think weve seen  you know for example weve seen some of our leading returning customers basically ramping into productions again these are all the design wins that we piled up and weve been talking about on different conference calls and conferences you know they are beginning to ramp into production and you know the industrial always has a longer lead time on consumer so i think thats the effects were seeing we dont see any particular market segment standing out either in a positive or a negative waysuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst okay good thats helpful and then the new products that are coming online to help you grow with ecoxip and others are they on schedule to track to production versus where you expect it three months ago are any coming in sooner or any perhaps getting put out a little bit that color would be helpfulnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo well everything is on schedule you know we are aware you know the products that we taped out in the first quarter and are sampling with the early customers and i shed some color as what to expect for the rest of the year from new products tapeouts today in the call so far everything is on schedulesuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst okay and then a quick question for ron ron the headcount kind of expectation the end of year versus now are you expecting to grow that count much or is that something thats relatively in place nowron shelton adesto technologies corporation  cfo you know for the most part in place there might be one or two ads here or there but its effectively in placesuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst okay two last questions one on the china meter market is that one that you think has a good kind of ramp opportunity in the second half because of the potential volumes there is that something that comes in slowly any thoughts there would be helpfulnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo no i wouldnt  i  yes i think its like any industrial market it will be a slow ramp and if we have a key milestone outside what i just talked about we will basically communicate that but right now were just seeing an increased level of sampling activity for the various industrial markets metering being just one of them in asiasuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst okay and then just one last clarification lighting is that going to be an industrial category or a consumer category or a mix of bothnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo we put that in the consumer spacesuji desilva roth capital partners  analyst okay great thanks guys once again congratulationsron shelton adesto technologies corporation  cfo thanks sujioperator our next question comes from rick schafer of oppenheimer your line is openrick schafer oppenheimer  analyst yes thanks guys and ill add my congratulation as well maybe a follow up first to an earlier question would you be able to compare the revenue contribution from fusion flash you know you have cbram today and then maybe where you expect that kind of mix to look or what you expect it to look like exiting this year just to kind of give us an idea of the relative  maybe what relative growth rates areron shelton adesto technologies corporation  cfo yes hey rick this is ron you know today and historically dataflash has been about  of the revenue and i guess as we go through the year you know narbeh talked about in his earlier comments that the standard flash products may exit the year at  or around  of overall revenue and fusion will come up as we go through the year so i would expect dataflash to probably come down closer to  and with the balance split between standard serial flash and fusionthis year cbram or  and ecoxip arent a material contributor to revenue and those will start to ramp sometime in rick schafer oppenheimer  analyst okay thanks and then speaking of cbram i mean when we would look out toward earlier  or when you expect it to start ramping where do you see initial traction being the strongest there you know if youre talking about and end market like industrial or consumer pc elsewherenarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo yes so again i would focus more on the product families right so if i look the mavriq which is i think what youre referring to the mavriq family our main focus especially with this new camera module specific product that we tapedout is the camera module market obviously weve been getting qualified sampling with some contract manufacturers as i mentioned in that area just to seed the market and right now we are engaged with all the top tier camera module manufacturers showcasing what we have today and also letting them know whats the new camera module specific product which is about to  we should have samples of that late in the yearso once we have a design win i would be able to shed more color on that but our focus is going to be there in terms of the camera module market in rick schafer oppenheimer  analyst got it thanks guys thats it for meoperator our next question comes from rajvindra gill of needham  company your line is openrajvindra gill needham  company  analyst yes thanks for taking my questions and i echo the congratulations so a question on the ecoxip product can you talk a little bit about the  you know the asp for the product and the density for the product you know relative to the fusion family i would assume it would have higher asps potentially maybe if you could elaborate on that that would be helpfulnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo sure so first in terms of density there is the first ecoxip product that we produced we have samples again either a mb and youre right typically the ecoxip products are targeting higher density applications so  and i mentioned we are taping out the megabyte version of the ecoxip this quarter and really the way we decide what to tape out when is really the engagement with lead high volume customers to understand timing of when they are releasing their socs of mcus to intercept with thatin terms of asps naturally they are higher than the fusion because first of all just with the memory so its a bigger die a discrete higher density higher asp but also more importantly the business model of ecoxip is slightly different than the fusion the fusion typically is sold as component package device we some opportunities that we sell fusion as a known good die but in the case of ecoxip the equation is reverse so wed be selling that more in terms of known good dies as a system in package applicationsand so as such the cost of the package and the  you know the final test is not a part of the product so average asps i would say you know its  youre looking above   again it depends on the customers and volumes and so forth whereas fusion family on the average asps youre looking at you know less than  you know close to half or less than thatrajvindra gill needham  company  analyst all right thats helpful and we talk a little bit about  you know on the fusion flash business in the last quarter you said that you had shipped about  million fusion flash units and you expect that to double in  are we still on track there and can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the specific demand drivers for the fusion flash product this year has the design mix been changing for younarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo yes so the main driver again is vastly operated connected devices like bluetooth and so forth in terms of being on track for the half year the answer is yes if i look at volume shipment quarter q of  versus  we are up significantly over last year for this quarter so we are on track for  to hit the numbers that we talked about in rajvindra gill needham  company  analyst and the last question for me ron in terms of the balance sheet how do we think about deleveraging i think in the past you had said that you were  you know theres a goal to pay down the debt how do we think about debt repayment and going forward thank youron shelton adesto technologies corporation  cfo sure so the terms thats amotizing right now is amortizing about a million seven a quarter so you know from  we talked about getting ebitda positive in the middle of this year you take that combined with you know growing revenues growing profitability you know managing working capital well we have enough capital today to service debt and run the businessrajvindra gill needham  company  analyst thank younarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo yesoperator our next question comes from orin hirschman of aigh investment partners your line is openorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst hi how are younarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo hi orin how are youorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst good okay im good ill ask you two question for now one is you had mentioned in the passing of the nxp what you are working on with nxp with qualcomm is that  were you referring to reference designs or were you referring to actually the first early design wins sorry i wasnt clear on thatnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo so we talked about this in fact there was a press release on this as well the joint press release with nxp so its a design win for ecoxip product and again this one because its  really the product is being sold two ways to the customer in one case its going to be as a known good die to be attached within the package with mcus and the second case it would be a part of reference designs so its a combination of what you just mentionedorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst okay but that first design was what you were  design win was what you were referring tonarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo no so what  in case of the ecoxip the customer has to incorporate basically the interface to be able to take full advantage of the ecoxip inside their soc or mcusorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst okaynarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo so in the case of several customers and actually being one of them they have done thatorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst okaynarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo in fact we designed the part in collaboration with several competing customers like nxporin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst okay and just going back to the camera modules were you actually in  even if its very small volumes today or are you actually in the commercial modulenarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo no were not so what we did is we were able to showcase the benefits of the mavriq platform with a large contract manufacturer in the camera module and together we went to bid on a camera module business of a large chinese camera module maker what happened is the camera module marker decided to go with a different contract manufacturer so we adesto lost that opportunity but what it ended up happening is we realized its a huge opportunity and the mavriq platform is ideally suited for this application today and where its going two three four years down the road so we put a concerted effort to design solutions specific for that end marketand since then this was about a year ago weve been engaged with other contract manufacturers as well as module makers to kind of prepare them for this new product that well be releasing end of the yearorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst and is the driver there the module maker or is the driver the actual end customer that makes whats in the handsetnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo for  the first one is the module maker benefits is  cant come to the module maker the contract manufacturer or the end camera user because end of today were using the cost of embedding camera modules in gadgetsorin hirschman aigh investment partners  analyst okay great okay thanks very muchoperator there are no further questions id like to turn the call back over to narbeh for any closing remarksnarbeh derhacobian adesto technologies corporation  president and ceo thank you thanks
