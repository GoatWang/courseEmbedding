the primary objective of our firm�s investment policy is first and foremost to protect our client�s money while safely growing assets over time  we believe that a key to increasing your wealth is to first and foremost protect your wealth  we achieve this objective by adhering to the following principles investing only in great businesses that are industry leaders with proven track records of operating excellence understanding the importance of valuation and only purchasing stocks we believe are priced at or below their true worth�  experience has proven that most of the money is made using a sound buy discipline selling great businesses that we like but are trading well above their true worth�  we realize that even great businesse can become dangerously overvalued avoiding deeply cyclical companies whose earnings are erratic  we consider these to be trading stocks rather than securities in which to invest for the longterm and we are not traders adhering to our sound investing principles and having the conviction to stay the course through both bull and bear markets  occasionally we will sell a stock that is overvalued relative to its true worth� but whose market price is still rising  since equities eventually revert to their true worth� and we believe that market timing is a less than perfect science we have found this to be a prudent way of protecting your assets over the longterm knowing our companies extremely well by investing significant intellectual capital and resources to clearly understand each of our great businesses  we use both quantitative and qualitative analysis when selecting stocks for our portfolios  both are vitally important when choosing the next best stock providing diversification within a concentrated portfolio  we balance our portfolios and avoid allocating too much of the portfolio to a particular sector or idea  we take our responsibility to protect and grow your wealth seriously  our interests are directly aligned with
