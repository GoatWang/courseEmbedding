nationwide life and annuity insurance company nationwide financial services inc nfs or collectively with its subsidiaries the company was formed in november  nfs is the holding company for nationwide life insurance company nlic nationwide life and annuity insurance company nlaic and other companies that comprise the life insurance and retirement savings operations of the nationwide group of companies nationwide this group includes nationwide financial network nfn an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base nfs is incorporated in delaware and maintains its principal executive offices in columbus ohio the company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of its business the companys legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the company operates these matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their outcomes cannot be predicted regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the companys litigation matters furthermore it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs claims for liability or damages in some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or in the event of certification the size of the class and class period in many of the cases the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available the company believes however that based on currently known information the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys condensed consolidated financial position nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the companys condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period the various businesses conducted by the company are subject to oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities including but not limited to the securities and exchange commission the financial industry regulatory authority the department of labor the internal revenue service and state insurance authorities such regulatory entities may in the normal course be engaged in general or targeted inquiries examinations and investigations of the company andor its pros affiliates the financial services industry has been the subject of increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the company andor its affiliates the company is cooperating with regulators the company will cooperate with

its business the companys legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the company operates the companys litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their outcomes cannot be predicted regulatory proceedings also could affect the outcome of one or more of the companys litigations matters furthermore it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs claims for liability or damages in some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or in the event of certification the size of the class and class period in many of the cases the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available management believes however that based on their currently known information the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position nonetheless
