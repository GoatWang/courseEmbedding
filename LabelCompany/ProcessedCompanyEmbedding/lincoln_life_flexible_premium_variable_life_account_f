mind flexible premium adjustable life insurance is a type of whole life insurance policy that offers individuals the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of their investment choice and monthly premiums it provides both a death benefit and an investment vehicle many individuals opt for such a policy because it provides a form of forced savings for retirement while also protecting dependents in the event of premature death the first key to understanding this type of insurance is understanding whole life insurance policies whole life policies are distinct from term life because the death benefit on a whole life policy is paid no matter when the insured dies with term policies the death benefit is paid only during a set period for example for his beneficiaries to collect the death benefit on a year term the insured would have to die within the year period that the policy was active with a whole life policy premium payments continue for life and the death benefit is paid no matter when the insured dies premiums for this type of policy are generally more expensive than those for a term policy they are also more expensive because the insured pays another fee over and above the cost of insurance which is invested in various types of investment vehicles the payments are invested in one of two ways the investor may have control over the investments and receive a variable rate of return or he may have no control over the investment and receive a fixed rate of return in other words an investor with a variable policy pays extra premiums that are invested and then gets to direct the course of that investment ideally growing his policy and the amount he is eventually paid an investor with a fixed rate policy on the other hand pays extra premiums in and earns a fixed rate of return while the insurance company invests those premiums a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy is an alternative fixed rate policy that gives investors greater freedom instead of paying the same premiums every month the insured can choose to pay within a range the amount he pays in ultimately affects how much income he will earn from the life insurance policy he also has discretion to direct the investment of his money within the terms of the policy the money eventually paid out to him in the form of withdrawals or dividends fluctuates based both on how much he paid on a monthly basis and based on how well his investments perform some policies may contain a guaranteed minimum rate of return when a policy is purchased as long as a minimum amount of premiums are

insurance companies only  percent out of the  insurances companies in the us have an a superior rating so find one of those because legally life insurance companies can wait six months to pay out a death benefit and the average one waits  months also make sure that you are getting what you want out of the program lump sum or monthly installments income replacement or final expenses all good things to consider i would recommend a straight whole life policy that gets locked in at a young age to take care of final expenses and some term with a high face amount to cover your liabilities anon post  i had an ordinary whole life level premium plan for k my agent passed away and in the fourth year his replacement called to say they had a new and better deal for me it was called flexible premium adjustable life insurance the only description he provided was that it provided a surplus or reserve premium to be invested in a variety of capital gain and income producing vehicles i told him to leave my original policy untouched but he could write an additional policy to reach total  million instead he rewrote entire policy for the better policy and collected a k commission i did not know these details until  years later because the new policy was mailed to the trustee of the family trust who was named the beneficiary the trustee received the policy and simply placed it in our trust file it was uncovered only  years later when we were told premiums had reached a level twice what we had been paying kyear in the course of our subsequent communication with the insurer they admitted a significant error in calculation of the premiums from  years ago they are now recalculating and you can imagine things are a bit tense around here i guess i should have had the decency to die younger but at  i am now in something of a bind i cant pay current k out of social security view entire post anon post  when shopping for life insurance its basically the same thing as shopping around for any product or service  you compare rates and coverage from different life insurance companieswhen we had our first child i started getting life insurance quotes online to see what was available one site was a good resource it gave me rates companies and coverage options and by getting a few quotes from three or four companies i began to learn generally what a good price for certain coverage was they also have tons of articles but lets face it you cant get specific prices without picking what specific coverage you wantgood luck alchemy hope this helps a bit in your search alchemy post  how do i tell if i am paying a good price for life insurance if buying life insurance is anything like buying automobile insurance then prices can vary widely i am getting married soon and i want to buy a motorcycle the only way my fiancée will let me have a motorcycle is if i buy some type of life insurance riding bikes can be dangerous in arizona and we have a twoyearold daughter so i can agree with her point of view my only problem is i don’t know where to start shopping does anyone have any good advice for a relatively young person shopping for life insurance anon post  are

application that has been filed and approved by the state insurance department the application contains questions on the identity and health of the proposed insured as well as other information used in the underwriting and issue process the application is also signed by the agent who is a licensed representative of lincoln life in some circumstances involving groups of individuals related by association employer or some other affiliation a shortened form of the application may be used such form contains fewer questions and the underwriting is either done on a simplified issue or a guaranteed issue basis the application may be submitted to lincoln life with or without a premium payment there are restrictions as to the maximum specified amount that may be applied for when premium is accepted with the application when premium is accepted with the application a conditional receipt is given to the applicant b underwriting process the underwriting process consists of a thorough

and specified amount combinations such additional requirements would include any or all of such items as follows inspection reports by telephone or in person medical information bureau reports attending physician statements motor vehicle reports and various levels of physical examination by paramedical or medical personnel the underwriting process results in an evaluation by the underwriter of the nature and degree of mortality risk associated with the proposed insured the underwriter assigns a classification ranging from preferred to declined depending on the health avocations and other criteria of the proposed insured table ratings and temporary or flat extrapremiums are used when appropriate insureds are also classified on the basis of their tobacco use c issue process the issue process consists of building the policy on the computer system that issues and administers the policy as well as the printing and assembling of the policy itself the underwriting class assigned by the underwriter is reflected in the cost of insurance charges used in the policy the policy reflects the specified amount beneficiary and other relevant information contained on the application the policy is normally delivered by the agent to the applicant or owner if no premium was accepted with the application the premium is normally collected when the policy is delivered in cases where the premium is to be paid by the proceeds of a surrender of an existing life insurance policy the proceeds are normally paid directly to lincoln life by the other insurance company the minimum specified amount that may be issued is  there is no stated maximum specified amount allowable issue ages for the primary insured may be from  to  inclusive d increases in specified amount the owner may apply for increases to the specified amount the underwriting and issue processes for such increases are analagous to those used for new issues except that if sufficient net cash surrender value exists in the policy to fund the new surrender charges and monthly deductions associated with the increase no additional premium will be required for the increase e reinstatements policies that lapse due to insufficient premium payments or insufficient policy value may be reinstated within  years of the date of lapse an application similar to that required for new issue is required and the proposed insured must qualify for the same underwriting class as originally issued premiums sufficient to make the next two death benefit guarantee monthly premiums if the net cash surrender value is negative or else the next two monthly deductions are required to reinstate the policy the period from lapse to reinstatement becomes a period of noncoverage ii premium processing a initial premium premiums may be paid annually semiannually quarterly or monthly automatic bank check the minimum initial premium required to place the policy in force is the first modal premium annual semiannual quarterly or for automatic bank check policies the death benefit guarantee monthly premium minimum premium for the first two months of coverage the minimum premium is based on the age sex classification specified

health and occupation subject to the minimum premium requirements for the first policy year and subject to federal maximum premium limitations premiums are flexible and may be paid at any time and in any amount  pexnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd initial premiums are paid  with the application or  upon delivery of the policy or  by proceeds of surrender of a policy issued by another company all net premiums received prior to the record date generally a date within three business days of the later of the date the last requirement is received or the date of underwriting approval are allocated to the general account as of the later of the policy date or the date the premium is received interest is credited to policy values from the date of allocation to the general account until the record date the day after the record date the value in the general account is reallocated to each of the funds and the general account according to the instructions of the individual contained in the application or a supplement to the application or any other suitable form in cases where the initial premium is received later than the policy date the amount credited to the general account is net of monthly deductions cost of insurance and monthly charge for monthly anniversaries preceding the date of receipt b minimum premiumsplanned periodic premiums the owner must pay sufficient premium to keep the policy in force at all times during the first policy year the minimum premium must be paid each month during the second and third policy year payment of the minimum premium is required only if the net cash surrender value is negative or if the owner wishes to keep the death benefit guarantee the guarantee that the policy will stay in force despite negative cash surrender value after the third policy year the owner must maintain sufficient net cash surrender value to meet monthly deductions whenever net cash surrender value is insufficient to meet those deductions the policy will enter into a  day grace period during the grace period the owner must make a premium payment sufficient for two months monthly deductions or the policy will lapse at the end of the grace period each owner also elects a planned periodic premium to be paid on a regular basis eg quarterly the planned premium is the amount normally billed periodically the owner is not required to pay the planned premium as such and may pay greater or smaller amounts at any time subject to minimum and maximum limitations the planned periodic premium may be changed at any time by written request of the owner planned premiums received prior to the record date are allocated to the general account in the same fashion as the initial premium premiums received after the record date are allocated to the general account and each of the funds according to the most recent allocation instructions provided by the owner c loan repayments whenever a loan is outstanding on the policy the owner may make payments to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan the payments reduce the outstanding loan balance by the amount of the loan repayment plus any unearned interest on that amount the total amount of loan reduction is immediately allocated to the general account and the funds according to the most recent premium allocation instructions provided by the owner  pexrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd d unscheduled payments unscheduled payments are payments that are received by lincoln life but do not match the planned periodic premium billed to the owner if such payments are designated as premium payments they are allocated in the same fashion as planned premiums if the payments are not designated as premium payments they are first applied to repay any outstanding loan on the policy and any excess is then applied as an unscheduled premium e excess premiums excess premiums can occur when a premium payment causes total premiums paid to exceed the maximum federal premium limitation under section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended also when the owner has given lincoln life instructions not to allow the policy to become a modified endowment contract under section a of the irc of  as amended excess premiums can result when a premium payment causes total premiums paid to exceed the pay limitation in either case lincoln life allocates as much premium as possible to the policy any excess is then applied first to the repayment of any outstanding loan on the policy and any further excess is refunded to the owner an exception occurs when premiums in excess of the pay limitation or in excess of the maximum federal premium limitation are received within  days of the policy anniversary and the owner has instructed lincoln life to hold the premium until it may be paid into the policy on the next policy anniversary iii redemptions a surrenders the owner may surrender the policy in whole or in part at any time partial surrenders are accomplished by requesting in writing a reduction in the specified amount of the policy such reduction will result in partial surrender charges being deducted from policy value the deduction will be made from the general account and the funds in proportion to the value in each account the partial surrender charge consists of the contingent deferred sales charge and the contingent deferred administrative charge the remaining surrender charge is reduced by the amount of this deduction from policy value in determining the amount of the surrender charge decreases are allocated first to the most recent increase then to the next most recent increase and so forth full surrender is accomplished by requesting full surrender in writing on a form suitable to lincoln life and results in the full surrender charge being deducted from surrender proceeds the full value in the general account and each of the funds is deducted from each account and the surrender charge is deducted from the total of those amounts the remaining net cash surrender value is paid to the owner for surrenders in the first two policy years a calculation is performed to determine whether any excess sales load has been deducted in the surrender process if so the excess sales load is added to the amount of surrender proceeds otherwise calculated and the total is paid to the owner  pexth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th b lapse if the owner fails to make required premium payments and the  day grace period expires the policy will lapse in this case the surrender charge and any due and unpaid monthly deductions are deducted from the policy value the full value in the general account and each of the subaccounts is deducted from each account and the surrender charge and other amounts due are deducted from the total of those amounts for lapses in the first two policy years a calculation is performed to determine whether any excess sales load has been deducted in the lapse process if so the excess sales load is refunded to the owner c withdrawals after the first policy year the owner may make withdrawals from the policy value once per policy year the maximum withdrawal is  of the net cash surrender value for each policy year when the surrender charge is greater than zero however as a current practice the  limitation is not enforced for policy years following the tenth policy anniversary the amount withdrawn is subject to withdrawal charges see below the total amount of the withdrawal is deducted from the general account and each of the funds in proportion to the value in each account unless the owner has given special instructions to deduct the amount in some other fashion and lincoln life has agreed to do so at any time that the surrender charge is greater than zero withdrawals incur a withdrawal charge which is currently  of the withdrawn amount at other times the withdrawal charge is currently  the withdrawal charge is guaranteed not to exceed the greater of  or  of the withdrawn amount when the surrender charge is greater than zero and guaranteed not to exceed  at other times the withdrawal charge consists of a processing fee and a possible early withdrawal penalty the processing fee is currently  guaranteed not to exceed  and the balance of the withdrawal charge if any constitutes the early withdrawal penalty the remaining surrender charge is reduced by the amount of any early withdrawal penalty withdrawals may affect the death benefit under the policy if the death benefit option is type  any withdrawal reduces the specified amount by an equal amount in contrast if the death benefit option is type  withdrawals do not affect the specified amount if the policy value is such that the death benefit is determined by using one of the ircrequired percentages any withdrawal may reduce the death benefit by as much as the applicable percentage times the amount of the withdrawal d loans at any time the owner may borrow amounts up to the total net cash surrender value any amount borrowed bears interest of  in advance  annual effective rate and is credited a current interest rate no less than  interest may be paid in cash or added to the loan in which case the total loaned amount is charged and credited interest as described above the total amount loaned is transfered from the general account and each of the funds in proportion to the value in each account unless the owner has given special instructions to deduct the amount in some other fashion and lincoln life has agreed to do so the amount of the loan is paid to the owner and the amount of the loan reduces the net cash surrender value  pexth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th e death benefits the policy provides for the payment of the death benefit as defined in the policy form upon the death of the insured two death benefit types are available type  pays the specified amount of the policy and type  pays the specified amount of the policy plus the policy value under each death benefit type the actual death benefit may be larger if required under section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended death benefit proceeds are reduced by the amount of any outstanding loan the exact amount of the death benefit is determined as of the date of the insureds death effective that day the policy value in the general account and each of the funds is valued and the results are used in the calculation of the actual death benefit interest is paid on the death benefit from the date of death until actual payment to the beneficiaries f accelerated death benefits the owner may elect to attach the accelerated death benefit rider to the policy if benefit claims occur under this rider a lien is placed against the policy equal in amount to the benefit paid increased with interest in arrears until the date of death the payment of the benefit has no effect on the policy value in the general account and in each of the funds when the death benefit is calculated the amount of the lien plus interest is deducted from the death proceeds under the terms of the rider iii refund procedures a declines and nottakenouts in cases where the application is declined by lincoln life or the policy is nottakenout by the owner all monies received are refunded to the owner without interest such monies would not have been invested in any of the underlying funds so no investment experience is possible b free look procedures the policy contains a free look provision that allows the owner to cancel the policy and receive a full refund of premiums paid the free look period extends to the latest of  days from receipt of the policy  days from the signing of part  of the application or  days from the mailing or personal delivery of the notice of withdrawal right where state insurance regulations so require the free look period may be extended to meet such requirements if the owner exercises the free look privilege all policy value is removed from the general account and each of the funds and the full amount of all premiums paid is refunded without interest or investment experience c suicide the policy contains a suicide provision that limits lincoln lifes liability if the insured commits suicide within two years of the issue of the policy and again within two years of any reinstatement or any increase in specified amount if it is determined that the insured committed suicide within two  pexth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th years of initial policy issue all policy value is removed from the general account and each of the funds and an amount without interest or investment experience equal to the following is paid to the owner or beneficiary all premiums paid minus any policy loan plus any unearned loan interest minus any prior withdrawals and minus the cost of any riders similarly if suicide occurs within two years of any reinstatement an amount similarly calculated except that only premiums paid since the date of reinstatement are refunded is paid if suicide occurs within two years of any increase in specified amount and after two years from policy issue the death benefit for the original specified amount is processed normally and any cost of insurance deductions made for the increased specified amount are added to the death benefit proceeds the death benefit of the increased specified amount is not paid d incontestibility the policy contains a contestibility provision that allows lincoln life to contest the validity of the policy based on representations made in the application any supplement to the application or any application for increase in specified amount or any reinstatement application e incorrect age or sex if there is a mistake in the age or sex of the insured that is determined while the insured is still living the age and sex are corrected and an adjustment is made to the policy values accordingly if the mistake is determined in the process of settling the death claim the death benefit is adjusted to that amount that would be purchased by the most recent cost of insurance at the correct age and sex iv transfers a transfers from the general account to the separate account the owner may request to transfer amounts from the general account to the separate account at any time the maximum amount transferrable from the general account is  of the policy value in the general account in any twelve consecutive months however this limitation is currently waived for the first six policy months amounts transferred from the general account are paid into each of the funds according to the instructions of the owner telephone transfers are permitted if the owner has completed the necessary telephone transfer authorization form and correctly identifies himself based on information contained in the authorization form prior to making the transfer request transfers may be made by other persons who can provide the required authorization information transfers are subject to a transfer charge of as much as  under current practice the transfer charge is  b transfers between funds and from the separate account to the general account the owner may request to transfer amounts between the funds or from the separate account to the general account a maximum of twelvetransfers is permitted per year including transfers from the general account to the  pexlast�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th separate account amounts transferred between funds are redeemed from one fund and purchased into the requested fund as of the day the request is received telephone transfers are permitted as described in the preceding section c transfer privilege under rule etbvb at any time in the life of the policy the owner may transfer  of the value in the funds to the general account by so doing the owner effectively eliminates the investment risks associated with the underlying funds and causes the policy to benefit from a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate of  accordingly the death benefit and policy values of the policy will no longer depend on the investment experience of the separate account on the date of transfer of all values to the general account the death benefit netamountatrisk and policy values require no special adjustments  rdates referenced herein
