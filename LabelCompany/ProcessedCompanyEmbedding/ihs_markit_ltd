operators’ lofty production targets supported by strong hedging ihs markit says permianfocused eps have hedged  percent of oil production at more than  per barrel july    pm eastern daylight time  houstoneon enhanced online newsoilweighted exploration and production ep companies operating in the prolific permian basin have  percent of their oil production hedged at an average strike price of approximately  per barrel this supports their aggressive production targets for  according to new analysis from ihs markit nasdaq info a world leader in critical information analytics and solutions “at present it would be a challenge for the permian eps to replicate their  hedge positions in  given the weakness in oil prices and the relatively flat futures curve” the ihs markit hedging analysis entitled “company peer group analysis—oilweighted us eps permian operators’ lofty production targets supported by strong hedging” evaluated the oil and gas hedging in place for a group of  oilweighted us eps in the ihs markit coverage universe including a subgroup of  permian basinfocused operators overall the ihs markit analysis noted that the permianfocused oilweighted ep peer group has hedged  percent of remaining  oil production at a weightedaverage implied price of  per barrel and  percent of remaining  gas production hedged at  per mcf this compares with just  percent of oil production and  percent of gas production hedged by the nonpermian ep oilweighted peer group in  ihs markit said the permianfocused operators have locked in a substantially higher portion of production than their nonpermian counterparts providing support for the group’s aggressive productiongrowth targets according to the ihs markit report “the different levels of hedging between the two oilweighted subgroups of permian versus nonpermian ep operators is reflected in the wide disparity of their production growth targets and the difference is striking” said paul o’donnell principal equity analyst at ihs markit and author of the hedging analysis “the median permian ep is expected to increase its production by  percent in  as compared to those oilweighted operators outside the permian who have hedged just  percent of  oil production and are anticipating a median decline of  percent in oilliquids production consequently we expect the permian eps will be less likely to downwardly revise  spending plans and production targets in the upcoming secondquarter  earnings announcements compared with their nonpermian counterparts” companies hedge their production to provide a level of protection against oil and gas price fluctuations and during the period of volatile prices throughout most of  and  north american ep companies benefitted significantly from having large hedge books o’donnell said “in  hedging is still important for these eps especially the more debtladen companies which are less likely to withstand sustained low prices or significant price fluctuations” o’donnell said “the oilweighted peer group increased its  oil hedging from  percent to  percent since the time of our previous hedging study based off of thirdquarter  data” permian operators with the best downside protection if prices were to drop to  per barrel include concho resources parsley energy and laredo petroleum who would all have hedged prices above  per barrel in  and  for  the permian eps have already hedged  percent of oil production at  per barrel and  percent of gas at  per mcf while the nonpermian eps are largely unhedged for oil but also have  percent of their gas production hedged “at present it would be a challenge for the permian eps to replicate their  hedge positions in  given the weakness in oil prices and the relatively flat futures curve” o’donnell said to speak

production at more than  per barrel july    pm eastern daylight time  houstoneon enhanced online newsoilweighted exploration and production ep companies operating in the prolific permian basin have  percent of their oil production hedged at an average strike price of approximately  per barrel this supports their aggressive production targets for  according to new analysis from ihs markit nasdaq info a world leader in critical information analytics and solutions “at present it would be a challenge for the permian eps to replicate their  hedge positions in  given the weakness in oil prices and the relatively flat futures curve” the ihs markit hedging analysis entitled “company peer group analysis—oilweighted us eps permian operators’ lofty production targets supported by strong hedging” evaluated the oil and gas hedging in place for a group of  oilweighted us eps in the ihs markit coverage universe including a subgroup of  permian basinfocused operators overall the ihs markit analysis noted that the permianfocused oilweighted ep peer group has hedged  percent of remaining  oil production at a weightedaverage implied price of  per barrel and  percent of remaining  gas production hedged at  per mcf this compares with just  percent of oil production and  percent of gas production hedged by the nonpermian ep oilweighted peer group in  ihs markit said the permianfocused operators have locked in a substantially higher portion of production than their nonpermian counterparts providing support for the group’s aggressive productiongrowth targets according to the ihs markit report “the different levels of hedging between the two oilweighted subgroups of permian versus nonpermian ep operators is reflected in the wide disparity of their production growth targets and the difference is striking” said paul o’donnell principal equity analyst at ihs markit and author of the hedging analysis “the median permian ep is expected to increase its production by  percent in  as compared to those oilweighted operators outside the permian who have hedged just  percent of  oil production and are anticipating a median decline of  percent in oilliquids production consequently we expect the permian eps will be less likely to downwardly revise  spending plans and production targets in the upcoming secondquarter  earnings announcements compared with their nonpermian counterparts” companies hedge their production to provide a level of protection against oil and gas price fluctuations and during the period of volatile prices throughout most of  and  north american ep companies benefitted significantly from having large hedge books o’donnell said “in  hedging is still important for these eps especially the more debtladen companies which are less likely to withstand sustained low prices or significant price fluctuations” o’donnell said “the oilweighted peer group increased its  oil hedging from  percent to  percent since the time of our previous hedging study based off of thirdquarter  data” permian operators with the best downside protection if prices were to drop to  per barrel include concho resources parsley energy and laredo petroleum who would all have hedged prices above  per barrel in  and  for  the permian eps have already hedged  percent of oil production at  per barrel and  percent of gas at  per mcf while the nonpermian eps are largely unhedged for oil but also have  percent of their gas production hedged “at present it would be a challenge for the permian eps to replicate their  hedge positions in  given the weakness in oil prices and the relatively flat futures curve” o’donnell said to speak with paul o’donnell please contact melissa manning at melissamanningihsmarkitcom for more information on the
