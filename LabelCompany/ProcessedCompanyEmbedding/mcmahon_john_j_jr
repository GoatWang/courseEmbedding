putative class action seeks recovery from bumble bee foods llc under the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act icfa 8 ilcs  the illinois food drug and cosmetic act ifdca  ilcs  and a variety of common law claims including unjust enrichment the named plaintiff joseph mcmahon alleges that bumble bee engaged in deceptive conduct when it sold various seafood products with labels that indicated they were an excellent source of omega  pls cmplt at ¶  bumble bee moves to dismiss mcmahons ifdca claim on preemption grounds and contends that mcmahons unjust enrichment claim is not a viable cause of action under illinois law in the alternative bumble bee moves to have mcmahons case stayed until january   which is when the fdcas recently adopted rule concerning omega nutrients becomes effective for the reasons that follow bumble bees motion is denied background mcmahon alleges that bumble bee made a number of impermissible qualitative statements about the quantity of omega acids in its seafood products the statements located on the labeling of bumble bees chunk white tuna in water its chunk white tuna in oil and its albacore tuna in water indicated that the products were an excellent source of omega and displayed an american heart association seal pls cmplt at  mcmahon contends these labels were deceptive and in violation of the ifdca when labeling food products if a food manufacturer wishes to make a qualitative statement about the nutritional value of a food product — such as that the product is an excellent source of or high in a particular nutrient — it must comply with both federal and state regulatory requirements if it fails to do so the product may be deemed misbranded  usc § a see  ilcs  the fdca permits food manufacturers to make a qualitative statement indicating that a food item is high in or an excellent source of a nutrient only if the product contains at least twenty percent or more of the recommended daily intake rdi or the daily reference value drv  cfr §  b and food manufacturers can only claim the product is a good source of a particular nutrient if it contains ten to nineteen percent of the rdi or drv of that nutrient id §  c if the fda has not established an rdi or drv for a particular nutrient then food manufacturers cannot make qualitative statements about that nutrient unless they submit a notification to the fda and receive its approval see  usc §  rg to receive fda approval the food manufacturer must submit to the fda an authoritative statement that has been published by the national academy of sciences or a governmental public health body that identifies the appropriate nutrient level for the product  usc §  rgii the manufacturer must also provide the fda with a copy of the exact qualitative statement it wishes to make on the product id if the fda takes no action within  days then the manufacturer can put the submitted statement on the products label notwithstanding the lack of an established rdi or drv for that nutrient id at any time thereafter however the fda can disallow the nutrient content claim by issuing a regulation prohibiting or modifying the claim or by finding that the petitioners notification lacks required information usc §  rh the ifdca directly tracks the requirements of the fdca stating that the illinois food and drug commission should make the regulations promulgated under the ifdca conform in so far as practicable with those promulgated under the federal act  ilcs  a additionally a federal regulation adopted pursuant to the ifdca takes effect in this state on the date it becomes effective as a federal regulation  ilcs  i with respect to omega nutrients the fda has not established an rdi or drv metric hence any food manufacturer that wishes to advertise its product with a qualitative statement about the presence of omegas must submit to the fda an application that follows the steps outlined in usc § r in  three separate food manufacturers did so and submitted nutrient content claim notifications to the fda claiming that the food and nutrition board of the institute of medicine iom of the national academy of sciences published a report that qualified as an authoritative statement concerning the rdi for omegas defs mot to dismiss at  bumble bee however was not one of these manufacturers citing the iom report the three manufacturers claimed that if one serving of their seafood products contained at least  mg of omega fats then they exceeded the fdca threshold requirements for products to be labelled as being high in or an excellent source of a particular nutrient they thus proposed to label their seafood products as an excellent source of omega epa and dha id the fda took no action within  days and on april   it became permissible for the submitting manufacturers to use their proposed label id although bumble bee had not submitted a notification to the fda it also soon began making similar claims on its own seafood labels those claims are what mcmahon alleges were deceptive despite its earlier acquiescence to the manufacturers notice on november   the fda published a proposed rule in response to the omega notifications see food labeling nutrient content claims alphalinolenic acid eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid omega fatty acids  fed reg  proposed nov   in its proposed rule the fda rejected the iom report as an authoritative statement because iom had determined the omegas reference values by using a method that was not recognized by the fda id at  the fda concluded that going forward food manufacturers could not make qualitative statements about the content of omegas in their products id although the omega rule was finalized on april 8  the fda decided to delay implementing the rule until january   this decision was based on comments submitted from affected manufacturers expressing concern about the costs associated with phasing out food labels that were permissible under the manufacturers previous notification sent to the fda but the fda did not indicate that civil actions enforcing current law were stayed pending the rules implementation discussion when considering a motion to dismiss under rule b the court accepts as true all wellpleaded facts and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff yeftich v navistar inc  fd   th cir exhibits that are attached to the complaint become part of the pleadings see fedrcivp  c and can be considered on a motion to dismiss bogie v rosenberg  fd   th cir in moving to dismiss mcmahons ifdca claim bumble bee contends that mcmahons state law claim is preempted by the fdca and in the alternative that this court should stay his case until january   defs mot to dismiss at   bumble bee also argues that mcmahons unjust enrichment claim does not state a viable cause of action under illinois law id at  these arguments are addressed in turn below a preemption bumble bee contends that the fdca expressly preempts mcmahons state law claim because he attempts to use state law to impose different and additional food labeling requirements than the fda which is prohibited by the fdcas preemption provision defs mot to dismiss at  bumble bee faces a strong presumption against preemption patriotic veterans inc v indiana  fd   th cir and in seeking to invalidate mcmahons state law claim it must surmount the starting presumption that congress did not intend to supplant state law de buono v nysaila med and clinical services fund  us 8   sct  8 ledd   federal law can however preempt state or local laws in three different ways express preemption field preemption and conflict preemption aux sable liquid products v murphy  fd 8  th cir8 express preemption which bumble bee invokes here occurs when a federal statute explicitly states that it overrides a state or local law that is inconsistent with the language of the preemption provision id bumble bee relies on the preemption provision of the fdca which states no state or political subdivision of a state may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in interstate commerce —  any requirement for a food which is the subject of a standard of identity established under section  of this title that is not identical to such standard of identity or that is not identical to the requirement of section g of this title  usc § a the act also prohibits states from imposing any requirement respecting any claim of the type described in section r of the fdcamade in the label or labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of section r  usc § a thus a state can impose requirements that are identical to those imposed by the fdca but if state law requirements differ from federal requirements — whether they are more or less onerous — then the state law is deemed preempted turek v general mills inc  fd   th cir the fdcas requirements can stem directly from the statute itself or from rules promulgated via the fdas rulemaking authority these rules contain just as much preemptive effect as the organic statute from which they are derived fidelity fed savings and loan assn v de la cuesta 8 us    sct   ledd  8 where congress has delegated the authority to regulate a particular field to an administrative agency the agencys regulations issued pursuant to that authority have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes thus if the federal regulations for making qualitative nutritional statements on food products were substantively different from ifdca requirements then the state law would be preempted but since the ifdca expressly adopts the fdca and the accompanying rules promulgated by the fda bumble bee cannot — and does not — contend that mcmahons ifdca claim is substantively different than an fdca claim because they are in fact one in the same see  ilcs  instead bumble bee alleges that mcmahons state law claim is inconsistent with federal law and thus preempted because he is bringing an enforcement claim under current law instead of waiting until the new fda rule regarding the labeling of omega products becomes effective on january   bumble bees claim does not withstand scrutiny as a threshold matter bumble bee misconstrues mcmahons complaint bumble bee contends that the fda   concluded that the omega rule will not take effect until  whereas mcmahon claims damages based on that legal theory right now defs mot at  but nothing in mcmahons complaint indicates that he is seeking to enforce the omega rule that becomes effective on january   rather mcmahons complaint makes abundantly clear that he is seeking to enforce provisions of the fdca that are in effect now and have been in effect since the time that mcmahon filed his complaint and which have been expressly adopted by the ifdca pls reply at  mcmahon alleges that bumble bees products were misbranded under existing law because bumble bee was not authorized to make statements about omegas because it failed to submit an application to the fda that other manufacturers did so mcmahon asserts did not give bumble bee license to include those claims as well resp at  as a substantive matter bumble bee provides no authority in support of its proposition that the current law has somehow been eviscerated by the omega rule that takes effect on january   although not cited by bumble bee in its motion on occasion an agencys decision to refrain from regulatory or enforcement action may have a preemptive effect on current state law gracia v volvo europa truck nv  fd   th cir  a federal decision to forgo regulation in a given area may imply an authoritative federal determination that the area is best left unregulated and in that event would have as much preemptive force as a decision to regulate citing arkansas elec coop corp v arkansas pub serv commn  us  8  sct   ledd  8 but if giving preemptive effect to an agencys decision to refrain from enforcement would create a regulatory gap courts have declined to do so see arkansas elec coop  us at   sct  but here there is no basis to infer that in deferring the implementation of more stringent regulation the fda intended to invalidate the existing regulatory requirements governing omega statements — why would the fda eliminate all regulation during a transition to a regime of greater regulation finding that the fdcas current requirements for qualitative statements were put in hiatus pending the implementation of the omega rule would create a regulatory gap without any enforcement at all giving manufacturers license to make qualitative statements about omegas without repercussion until the new rule takes effect bumble bee contends that such a gap would be permissible because to allow one state to start enforcing the omega prohibition now would undermine fdas regulatory authority and the national uniformity that congress intended to create with the fdca defs mot at  but again bumble bee is assuming that mcmahon seeks to enforce the new omega rule which is not the case there is nothing about allowing enforcement of the current fdca requirements that would undermine national conformity as those requirements carry equal force throughout the country thus rather than furthering the purposes of the fdca preempting mcmahons claim would leave a regulatory void where manufacturers could make qualitative nutritional statements without consequence simply put mcmahon does not allege that bumble bee is in violation of the future omega rule rather mcmahon contends that bumble bees products are and have been misbranded under current law namely the federal regulations that prohibit qualitative statements about a products nutritional value unless they exceed twenty percent of the rdi or drv pls resp at  under the law in effect today a firm can display on its products a qualitative statement regarding omega only if it submitted a notification to the fda identifying authority for its claim describing the scientific literature supporting that authority and by providing the exact qualitative language that will be included on the label these same requirements have been expressly adopted by the ifdca and it is these requirements that mcmahon alleges bumble bee violated these provisions carry just as much force now as they did before the fda adopted the omega rule and elected to refrain from implementing that rule until january   thus because the ifdca requirements and the current fdca requirements are one in the same and neither was disturbed by the fdas decision to delay implementation of the omega rule mcmahons ifdca claim does not fall within the purview of the fdcas preemption provision in the alternative bumble bee requests the court to stay mcmahons case until january   when the pending omega rule becomes effective bumble bee contends that if the court were to fashion mcmahons requested injunctive relief now it would unnecessarily complicate bumble bees efforts to fully comply with the law because it is currently in the process of changing its labels to comply with the fdas omega rule defs mot at  as a technical matter bumble bees argument is unpersuasive because it rests again on the faulty premise that the plaintiff is seeking to enforce the regulatory requirements of the new omega rule its statement that the court cannot order bumble bee to remove all nutrient content claims concerning omega sic before january   because that would be directly counter to the fdas omega rule mtn at  is simply wrong if under the existing regulations bumble bee is not authorized to include omega statements on its labels then the court would have the power to enjoin bumble bee from selling more misbranded products as a practical matter moreover it is unnecessary to stay the case at issue is bumble bees motion to dismiss in ruling on that motion the court only assumes the truth of the allegations in the complaint and cannot provide affirmative relief to the plaintiff even if the motion to dismiss is denied and at this late juncture it is a certainty that no injunction relating to bumble bees compliance with current labeling requirements will be entered before the new omega rule comes into effect on january   even without a stay there is no risk that bumble bee will be forced to comply with an injunction requiring it to remove omega statements from its labels before january   accordingly its motion to stay the case is denied b unjust enrichment bumble bee contends that unjust enrichment is not a cause of action under illinois law rather it is a theory of recovery if a plaintiff proves other unlawful conduct defs mot at  mcmahon counters that unjust enrichment is a viable cause of action under illinois law that can be asserted either independently or derivatively of another claim pls resp at  mcmahon has the better of this argument as well the illinois supreme court has repeatedly described unjust enrichment claims as independent claims for example in raintree homes inc v village of long grove the illinois supreme court observed that the plaintiffs have no substantive claim grounded in tort contract or statute therefore the only substantive basis for the claim is restitution to prevent unjust enrichment  illd 8 8 illdec 8 8 ned    the court went on to note that the plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim could stand even in the absence of another underlying substantive claim id in hpi health care services inc v mt vernon hospital inc  illd   illdec   ned  8 the court set forth the elements of an unjust enrichment claim to state a cause of action based on a theory of unjust enrichment a plaintiff must allege that the defendant has unjustly retained a benefit to the plaintiffs detriment and that the defendants retention of the benefit violates the fundamental principles of justice equity and good conscience see also indep voters v ill commerce commn  illd   illdec 8  ned 8 88 8 claim for restitution of excessive utility charges not tied to another cause of action bumble bees argument to the contrary is founded not upon more recent authority from the illinois supreme court but rather on a single opinion from the illinois appellate court that does not mention much less discuss the state supreme courts position on the question in raintree holdings see martis v grinnell mutual reinsurance co 88 illappd   illdec 8  ned  8  stating that an unjust enrichment claim cannot stand without a supporting substantive claim why this court would ignore relevant authority from the illinois supreme court in favor of an opinion from the appellate court that does not discuss the supreme court precedent bumble bee does not explain but in any event an opinion the seventh circuit has suggested that martis was limited to its particular facts and not a true variance from how the illinois supreme court considers unjust enrichment claims as illustrated by raintree homes cleary v philip morris inc  fd  8 th cir in any event whether an unjust enrichment claim can stand alone is of no moment here because in the present complaint it does not stand alone bumble bee assumes that mcmahons unjust enrichment claim is being asserted as an independent cause of action but mcmahons unjust enrichment claim is in fact derivative of his claim that bumble bee violated the icfa if his icfa claim falters so too will his unjust enrichment claim see eg assn benefit servs v caremark rx inc  fd  8 th cir where the plaintiffs claim of unjust enrichment is predicated on the same allegations of fraudulent conduct that support an independent claim of fraud resolution of the fraud claim against the plaintiff is dispositive of the unjust enrichment claim as well ciszewski v dennys corp which bumble bee offers in support of its contention that unjust enrichment is not a viable claim for mcmahon actually undermines bumble bees argument true in ciszewski the court dismissed the plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim as bumble bee notes but the court did so because they dismissed ciszewskis claim of fraud under the icfa and thus they had to likewise dismiss his claim of unjust enrichment no cv  wl 88 at  ndill apr   here bumble bee does not move to dismiss mcmahons icfa claim thus because that claim still stands so too does his claim for unjust enrichment    for the foregoing reasons bumble bees motion to dismiss is denied footnotes  this court has original jurisdiction over mcmahons claim under 8 usc § d because he seeks to certify a class action in which  the matter in controversy purportedly exceeds    exclusive of interest and costs  a member of the class is a citizen of a state that is different from a defendant and  the number of plaintiffs in the proposed class is greater than  see cmplt ¶   in response to bumble bees motion to dismiss mcmahon asks the court to take judicial notice of a bumble bee representatives deposition testimony given during another case pls resp at  bumble bees request is denied in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule  b the court may only consider the allegations in the complaint and the attached exhibits such as the allegedly deceptive labels that bumblebee includes with his complaint bogie  fd at  evidence from outside the fourcorners of the complaint such as deposition testimony cannot be considered in deciding bumble bees motion id  the plaintiff has not sought preliminary much less emergency injunctive relief  that said the fact that no injunction has been or will be issued before the new omega rule becomes effective does not insulate bumble bee from any claim for damages that the plaintiff has or may assert comment your name your email comments
