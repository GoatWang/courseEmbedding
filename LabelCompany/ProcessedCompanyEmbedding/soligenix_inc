pipeline  vaccinesbiodefense since  a new sense of vulnerability to radiation infectious diseases toxins and chemical agents has generated significant research and development efforts to identify and produce innovative therapies and means to protect against threats that could be used as biological weapons there is a growing need for products that protect the population against such agents of bioterrorism as well as against emerging infectious diseases that could arise through natural epidemics with very few exceptions such products do not exist and those that are available for current deployment are based on outdated and sometimes ineffective technologies many of these products will only be used in the event of an emergency products to combat biological warfare or bioterrorism will be supplied to the population from medicines stored in the us strategic national stockpile sns the federal government has previously established a special fund to acquire biological warfare countermeasures termed project bioshield which allocated  billion over a year period to acquire products for the sns realizing that many of these countermeasures do not yet exist the us government has established the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda the existence of barda creates a situation in which products arising from research primarily sponsored by the national institutes of health nih and the department of defense dod can be prioritized and then developed for largescale manufacturing and clinical evaluation and ultimately acquisition of the product for the sns soligenix inc is addressing the development of products and technologies that can be used to protect against several biological threats considered agents of bioterrorism consistent with biological warfare threats and emerging diseases that the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid a division of the nih has identified as high priorities soligenix is developing several potential products to prevent morbidity and mortality due to the threat of biological toxins infectious agents or radiation insult  in the area of biological toxins soligenix is focusing on preventive vaccination as the most feasible means to protect a susceptible population because toxin exposure is mediated through antibodies in the serum or present on mucosal surfaces that can be elicited by vaccination with subunit antigens soligenix is also developing therapeutic agents for infectious agents which are known to be incompatible with vaccination approaches and for treatment of the sequelae to radiation exposure soligenix’s process for product development of biodefense products is highly cooperative with government funding since the government itself will be the final customer for the products currently soligenix has government funded programs in all  areas vaccine for ricin toxin soligenix is currently operating under an up to  million contract award from niaid which is funding
