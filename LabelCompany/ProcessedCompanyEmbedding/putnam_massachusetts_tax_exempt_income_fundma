these risks before investing bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets singlestate investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a states taxexempt investments this may result in greater losses and volatility capital gains if any are taxed at the federal and in most cases state levels for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more

at the federal and in most cases state levels for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for

these risks before investing bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets singlestate investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a states taxexempt investments this may result in greater losses and volatility capital gains if any are taxed at the federal and in most cases state levels for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more

these risks before investing bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets singlestate investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a states taxexempt investments this may result in greater losses and volatility capital gains if any are taxed at the federal and in most cases state levels for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for
