momentum with a diverse pipelinejun  about omeros corporation omer matthew michniewicz long only deep value special situations growthsummaryomeros has one of the most diverse pipelines for a junior biotech out there at present giving it multiple potential areas for successomidria is gaining sales year over year and has lots of room to grow ahead of it giving omeros a potential positive cash flow generating product to fund pipeline developmentoms the furthest advanced pipeline candidate continues to show promise and if approved can unlock significant value for the company and its shareholders in the near futureomeros corporation nasdaqomer is a junior biotech with big goals and a large portfolio of drug candidates thats already generating growing revenues as it looks to fund the development of its potential blockbuster treatments with  programs under development both clinical and pre clinical theres a lot of potential here and the share price has been climbing to near alltime highs on the back of recent positive developments that being said this might just be the beginning of what could turn out to be a company with significant revenue generating ability in the next few years already generating growing revenues with omidria omidria which is a combination injectable drug used during cataract and intraocular lens surgery made of  phenylephrine and  ketorolac was approved back in q  by the fda and has been growing steadily each year in sales its main purpose is the prevention of intraoperative miosis shrinking of pupil size during cataractiol surgery and mitigation of pain post surgery its key benefit is in preventing damage to ocular structures specifically the iris during surgery as a result of too small of a pupil size in  omidria reached just over  million in total sales and in q  despite some lag with wholesale orders it generated  million in sales well on its way to continued growth heading into the year omidria is the first and only drug approved by the fda to be used during cataract surgery for the maintenance of pupil dilation and prevention of post operative pain since being launched it currently is used in  of all cataract surgeries in the us several of the locations where omidria is currently administered to patients undergoing cataract surgery are renowned teaching hospitals that train the next wave of ophthalmology residents and literally write the book on disease management and surgery for example the new york and massachusetts eye and ear centers are both currently locations where omidria is used on a regular basis this is a point i thought was worth noting due to the way practice patterns are established in medicine once a new drug with a clear benefit enters the market and starts to be used by a few top clinics and specialists in the field it will naturally spread to other sites due to the way medicolegal cases are handled assuming that omidria indeed works better than any other traditional method of maintaining pupil dilation during surgery then patients who have damage as a result of surgery where omidria was not used will have a legal case they can pursue in such cases the testimony of an expert or specialist in the field is used to establish what the current and most effective practice patterns are if more and more teaching hospitals start to recommend using omidria for all cataract and iol procedures then a new practice pattern will eventually emerge out of a necessity to stay up to date with new conventions on top of the small market penetration that omidria currently has that leaves plenty of runway for growth cataract surgery itself is not expected to slow down anytime soon the number of people needing surgery each year is slated to continue to increase due to the aging population demographics being experienced in the us at present nearly  million cataract surgeries are performed each year in the us overall the potential for omidria is pretty decent considering it isnt the main focus of omeros long term and is rather a way to become cash flow positive for omeros to fund their additional pipeline candidates through development the clinical pipeline source omeros as seen above the pipeline for omeros is quite extensive next to omidria oms stands out as the next most likely candidate to hit the market currently oms is being explored in three areas atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus which is a rare life threatening disorder resulting in blood clot formation in the kidneys hematopoietic stem cell transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy hscttma a disorder triggered by stem cell transplant surgery and immunoglobulin a nephropathy igan a disease where iga antibodies build up in the kidneys leading to inflammation and possible kidney failure oms is an antibody against masp a component of the complement system which when inhibited can help prevent damaging immune reactions seen in the above disorders at present a single arm phase  trial for ahus is recruiting patients and according to management could be enough to get an accelerated approval going for oms from the recent q cc our phase  program in patients with ahus is advancing the clinical trial is in patients with ongoing or newly diagnosed ahus based on discussions with both fda and ema the study design consists of an openlabel clinical trial with only a singlearm in other words no controlarm we expect that the data from this single study will satisfy both regulatory agencies this study design has the potential to shorten the path to regulatory approval by as much as several years and to save the associated costs our initial target enrollment is approximately  patients which could provide full approval in europe as well as satisfy requirements for accelerated approval in the us todate we have received orphan drug designation from the fda for tmas broadly including ahus and fast track designation for the treatment of patients with ahus as mentioned in the  annual report it is managements intention to get oms to market as fast as possible for any of the above indications this will allow omeros to start generating revenues and help fund further product development without being put in a financial bind the other two indications igan and hscttma will also have phase  trials starting this year in may omeros announced some early positive results from the phase  trial exploring omss effect in individuals with igan and other serious kidney disease this first stage of phase  results saw oms being used in individuals with igan as well as lupus nephritis and membranous nephropathy the results give some indication that oms can be explored in other kidney diseases in the future leading to label expansions down the road shortly after the positive may results the fda granted breakthrough therapy designation to oms for the treatment of igan this is another big win for omeros as it now has another pathway to expedited approval for oms oms is a phosphodiesterase  inhibitor being developed for the treatment of huntingtons disease and schizophrenia at present both phase  trials for the treatment of schizophrenia and huntingtons disease are on hold pending protocol design exploration and further meetings with the fda oms is another promising candidate with positive results to date which is being developed for the treatment of compulsive disorders and substance abuse addictions these trials are being conducted by the new york state psychiatric institute with majority of the funding coming from the national institute on drug abuse as such further trials and funding will likely be influenced by these two agencies but omeros retains the rights to the drug candidate should management choose to proceed with an nda for oms finally there is the oms ureteroscopy trial which is part of the pharmacosurgery division of omeros that is focused on combining lowdose fda approved agents and administering them directly to the site of surgery this program is on hold due to lack of funding and resources at present it should also be noted that omeros has another completed pharmacosurgery product which has been held up due to manufacturing agreement issues from the  annual report omsarthroscopy oms part of our pharmacosurgery platform was developed for use during all arthroscopic procedures including knee and shoulder arthroscopy and completed phase  trials in patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in june  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement or the oms agreement with fagron compounding services llc dba fagron sterile services and jcb laboratories llc or plasmin program  oms  collectively fagron an fdaregistered human drug outsourcing facility under which fagron is obligated to produce under good manufacturing practice or gmp and to commercialize oms in the us fagron has not met its performance diligence obligations under the oms agreement including initiating sales and we do not expect them to do so in the near term we are currently evaluating our options regarding the oms agreement and our oms program for a more detailed description of this agreement see license and development agreements source omeros  ar the preclinical pipeline source omeros  ar out of the preclinical pipeline ill focus on two areas the masp pathway and the gpcr platform oms was discovered as a unique inhibitor of masp a component of the alternative complement pathway system it will likely be developed for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phn another life threatening condition resulting in red blood cell breakdown which is believed to happen during the night phn along with ahus mentioned above are two areas that soliris eculizumab owned by alexion pharmaceuticals nasdaqalxn is developed for soliris sales are nearly  billion a year presently with phn and ahus being two of the main indications for the drug and just a few years ago soliris was the most expensive drug treatment on the market management has stated that oms works better than current treatments for phn by inhibiting both the intra and extravascular hemolysis seen in phn while other products only inhibit the intravascular breakdown of rbcs assuming this plays out similarly in human trials omeros has a substantial candidate in the works that could start taking market share from soliris in the future the gpcr platform is exciting due to managements discovery of a novel gpr inhibitor from the  annual report we believe these results demonstrate that gpr inhibition potentiates the activity of effector t cells which produce cytokines and are known to be integral to combating cancer also reducing the level of tregs is a key objective in cancer immunotherapy and high levels of tregs in solid tumors frequently correlate with poor patient outcomes in addition signaling and mechanistic studies support that gpr suppresses antitumor activity and inhibitors of gpr are expected to counteract that detrimental suppression if management chooses to proceed with this oncology preclinical candidate it would be entering a huge market that could realistically see it partnering with larger players to develop a promising candidate risks besides omidria omeros has no other approved products on the market generating revenue its extensive pipeline and clinical trials are resulting in a fairly significant cash burn of  million a quarter which will increase once additional phase  trials for oms are initiated as of march   management had  million in cce on hand as well as access to an additional  million tranche loan from crg due to omeros meeting lending requirements set out in its loan agreement with crg taking the  million in combined cash along with future revenue from omidria we might see a scenario play out where omeros either does not have to raise further capital or only has to raise a minimally dilutive amount however due to the recent stock price runup it might not be unreasonable to see management opting to do another share offering to take advantage of the high share price and put its financial situation in a more stable place going forward also the ceo and several institutions have been selling pretty sizable portions of their shares held this doesnt always mean much especially since most of the insider selling activity seems to be predetermined stock sales and the ceo still owns nearly  of the outstanding shares however it does seem like a buyout is off the table in the near term at least since if there were such discussions insiders would likely be holding onto all their shares and institutional investors would be pushing for a sale as well making them hold their shares alongside insiders finally omeros may never penetrate the cataract surgery space beyond its current sales if it does not win its patent lawsuit against generic drug manufacturer par pharmaceutical from the  annual report in july  we received a paragraph iv notice letter from par pharmaceutical inc and its subsidiary par sterile products llc collectively par stating that par filed an abbreviated new drug application nasdaqanda seeking approval from the fda to market a generic version of omidria prior to the expiration of three patents listed in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations orange book for omidria the orange book patents following receipt of the paragraph iv notice letter in september  we filed a patent infringement lawsuit under the hatchwaxman act against par in april  august  and november  we amended the lawsuit to assert additional omidria patents par has stipulated to infringement of each of the currently asserted patents and the court entered a partial judgment that pars filing of its anda constitutes an act of infringement of each of the currently asserted patents subject to pars continued invalidity defenses and any challenge to enforceability the filing of our suit against par triggered a month stay of the fdas approval of pars anda which is expected to remain in effect until late january  we have reviewed the invalidity assertions in pars paragraph iv notice letter and defenses and counterclaims and believe they do not have merit and we intend to defend our patents vigorously in the litigation against par with january  coming up in a few months this case result will have a significant impact on omidria sales if it goes in favor of par summary with a revenuegenerating candidate already on the market along with multiple promising and muchneeded drug candidates in the pipeline omeros has both a good shot at becoming financially self sufficient in its pursuit of developing its products as well as reaching blockbuster sales status with oms and eventually oms with management working on multiple indications and trials for oms it could be feasible to see the drug on the market within the next two years if all goes as planned if the plan works out as outlined todays market cap will be a bargain when reflected on in hindsight however i expect the stock price to have some uncertainty built around it due to the financial needs of the company and the lingering thoughts of dilution occurring any given week if such an event happens and the stock price has a setback it could be a good place to evaluate an entry position especially if any further positive regulatory changes and discussions take place like todays news of trumps plans to ease drug industry regulations ill end with a comparison between biotech investing and venture capital in both cases investors are betting on a team of individuals to deliver on a promising product in most cases there is no revenue being generated and there is likely only one product being bet on for success the earlier you get in the cheaper you acquire stock for however at the end of the process for venture capital it doesnt matter what price you got in if you invested in a winner because the upside is huge regardless i view biotech in a similar way if the longterm upside looks great enough the weektoweek price variations will matter little if a drug fails it wont matter much if you got in at  or  the stock will likely end up in penny stock land for the foreseeable future and percentage losses will be similar and independent of stock price however if it succeeds the upside is likely still multiples from your entry price disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours
