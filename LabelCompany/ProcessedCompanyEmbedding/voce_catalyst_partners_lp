voce capital sends letter to obagi medical products board of directors  business wire voce capital sends letter to obagi medical products board of directors investor criticizes recent adoption of poison pill and demands immediate action to rectify governance deficiencies and to evaluate strategic alternatives february    pm eastern standard time san franciscobusiness wirevoce capital management llc “voce” announced today that it has sent a letter to the board of directors of obagi medical products inc “obagi” nasdaqompi criticizing the board’s recent adoption of a poison pill and demanding immediate action to address corporate governance deficiencies and to evaluate strategic alternatives voce’s letter states that it believes obagi has spurned recent overtures to acquire the company and further cites pervasive corporate governance deficiencies that explain the board’s unwillingness to consider those proposals voce also expresses concern over the board’s recent decision to adopt a poison pill citing it as further evidence of the board’s entrenchment in the letter to the board voce’s managing partner j daniel plants said “we have grown increasingly concerned by the company’s lack of progress in broadening its product portfolio and expanding its reach in our view obagi would be much more valuable in the hands of a larger and more skilled operator and indeed we believe that interested strategic parties have approached the company only to be consistently rebuffed by a board unwilling to even entertain discussion of an acquisition proposal” mr plants went on to state in the letter “to date we have enjoyed regular and candid dialog with obagi and have refrained from publicly questioning or criticizing its leadership however we believe the company’s deficient corporate governance is a key contributor to its refusal to consider acquisition offers it has received and explains the actions the board has taken to entrench itself while we would have preferred to continue these discussions in private the board’s decision to adopt a poison pill – two days before christmas and in sight of the notice deadline for shareholder actions at the annual meeting – leads us to conclude that the board’s interests have become so misaligned with those of the obagi shareholders that public disclosure of these matters is not only warranted but required” voce’s letter also questions the obagi board’s independence particularly the undue influence of stonington partners and the absence of meaningful stock ownership by directors “the board appears to be preeminently interested in its selfperpetuation and the maintenance of its insular and clubby nature” specifically voce calls upon the board of obagi to immediately commence a review of the company’s strategic alternatives including good faith consideration of the strong strategic interest in acquiring the company overhaul the obagi board including the removal of directors fitzgibbons and bartholdson and their replacement with proper independent shareholder representation and commit that it will put the poison pill to a vote at the  annual meeting and that it will not adopt another

in response to the decision by the obagi board of directors the “board” on december   to adopt a “preferred share purchase rights plan” more commonly known as a “poison pill” we have grown increasingly concerned by the company’s lack of progress in broadening its product portfolio and expanding its reach in our view obagi would be much more valuable in the hands of a larger and more

us to conclude that the board’s interests have become so misaligned with those of the obagi shareholders that public disclosure of these matters is not only warranted but required    since its founding in  obagi has built a distinctive franchise its flagship nuderm® product line is universally acclaimed and the obagi brand commands loyalty from consumers and doctors alike obagi has an extremely valuable physician distribution network and a recurring revenue stream with no reimbursement risk as a result obagi enjoys premium margins and cash flows obagi has not however been able to grow beyond its original success with meaningful new products nor has it adequately monetized its distribution platform despite repeated attempts it has stumbled in efforts to develop new applications and treatments after years of discussion about potential international opportunities nonus revenues still comprise only about  of the company’s net sales and we’ve seen little traction in terms of inlicensing or acquiring complementary products that could be sold through obagi’s network obagi has not posted double digit revenue growth since  and it is expected to grow only  for  while not an abject failure these results are hardly cause for celebration given all of the time and capital that has been invested in trying to grow the company we believe the investment community broadly shares these concerns there is no sign that the appointment of mr hummel as ceo has changed any of this perhaps owing to his experience as a “big pharma” executive mr hummel initially talked about rejuvenating the company’s research pipeline on the last quarterly call however he shifted the company’s strategic focus to a new plan to launch a nationwide internet pharmacy this latest idea was short on details and presumably would be expensive complex and time consuming to implement and yet obagi’s key strengths – its core product line brand equity unique distribution and sound business model – are undoubtedly attractive to strategic acquirers which are better positioned to monetize these assets we believe obagi would field significant strategic interest from potential buyers in the following industries pharmaceutical aesthetic specialty and integrated categories alike aesthetic energy lasers beauty and cosmetics and health and wellness many of these players are much larger than obagi and would pay a significant premium to control this unique property moreover while the strategic rationales differ by category and by individual acquirer there are significant cost and revenue synergy opportunities based on our analysis a purchase price well in excess of obagi’s week high is not only achievable but is the likely outcome in the event of a transaction indeed we believe that potential acquirers have recently approached obagi only to be rebuffed by the company in our view the board’s fiduciary duties require it to consider in good faith any serious interest in acquiring the company and it appears that the board has abdicated its responsibility here the board is so adamantly opposed to a sale that it apparently ousted the previous ceo mr hummel’s predecessor over his advocacy of a sale of the company we believe the only credible alternative for the board at this juncture is to undertake a legitimate review of the company’s strategic alternatives with the advice of reputable legal and financial advisors if the board truly believes that its own strategic plans will create the highest value for shareholders then those plans can be evaluated and quantified and compared against the results of a thorough process a competitive process will also likely elicit more and better offers than those received to date as some parties particularly larger acquirers will only invest the time in a potential transaction if it appears that a deal is a legitimate possibility    we are also compelled to take issue with the lax corporate governance at obagi how can a company that derives the overwhelming majority of its revenues selling pharmaceutical products to women through the physician channel not have a single female or doctor on its board or at least someone with executive experience in beauty or cosmetics moreover while the company touts its efforts to cultivate a trendier image through viral marketing and social media and talks of its plans to broaden its appeal to younger consumers the average age of the men on the board is over  years old the board’s hiring of mr hummel as ceo – himself a director at the time of his appointment – is also troubling mr hummel is concurrently the chief executive of another company cobrek pharmaceuticals inc “cobrek” based in suburban chicago how can the ceo of a public company also be the ceo of another company in another city at the same time moreover since mr hummel has taken over as ceo of obagi the company has begun making payments to cobrek for unspecified “consulting” services while the company has previously responded to us that these matters have all been disclosed in public filings their disclosure does not clear their unseemly air let alone make them appropriate actions for a publiclytraded corporation but the most glaring governance deficiency is that the management and board of obagi own almost none of its common stock collectively the six members of the board including mr hummel own less than  of the company’s common stock to our knowledge none of the directors have ever purchased a single share of obagi stock in the open market including when it touched multiyear lows in  and including when the board thought the stock was a compelling enough value that it authorized the company to repurchase shares this lack of alignment with shareholder interests is succinctly illustrated by the continued board membership of messrs fitzgibbons and bartholdson these gentlemen are both executives of stonington partners “stonington” a leveraged buyout firm they along with mr hummel obtained their board seats after the acquisition of obagi by stonington but prior to its ipo while it is not uncommon for a financial sponsor to retain board representation following an ipo if it continues to hold a significant ownership position stonington sold all of its remaining obagi shares primarily back to the company in  to permit these gentlemen to retain their seats after the disposition of all but a token amount of their ownership suggests that their actions are primarily motivated by a desire to retain the prestige and perquisites of sitting on a public board in addition to the direct connection between messrs fitzgibbons and bartholdson – who remain business partners at stonington and have worked together for many years – the stonington reach in this boardroom extends even further all of the “independent” obagi directors have sat together on the boards of other stonington portfolio companies messrs fitzgibbons badie and grant all served together on the board of merisel inc a stonington investment messrs fitzgibbons and duerden were members of the dictaphone board another stonington portfolio company where mr duerden also served as the ceo – effectively making him a stonington employee at the time this same group of “independent” directors constituted obagi’s board at the time obagi repurchased stonington’s shares in  far from being an academic exercise in good corporate housekeeping these governance failures are at the heart of what precludes serious consideration of the company’s strategic alternatives quite simply the board appears to be preeminently interested in its selfperpetuation and the maintenance of its insular and clubby nature this misalignment has prevented a frank assessment of the likelihood that the company’s best option to create shareholder value is to sell itself to a larger and more skilled operator we believe this explains the board’s hostility to any proposals to acquire obagi and its ongoing efforts to entrench itself through actions such as appointing one of its own in mr hummel as ceo and the adoption of a poison pill unfortunately this list of obagi’s governance deficiencies is not exhaustive while there are many other steps the board should take to strengthen itself at a minimum we call upon the obagi board to immediately remove messrs fitzgibbons and bartholdson and replace them with independent directors whose ownership of common stock in the company aligns their interests with the broader obagi shareholder base    finally we return to what prompted this letter while the preceding list of operating and governance issues had concerned us the company’s recent adoption of a poison pill left us with no choice but to come forward the decision by this board – with its rank governance failures and misplaced priorities – at this time while it apparently refuses to even consider offers that might create meaningful shareholder value – is unacceptable it also bears repeating that company decided to implement the obagi poison pill on december  – while the majority of the investing world and press were already home for the holidays it did not issue a press release nor reflect it on the investor relations page of its website it chose to mail notice of this action to its shareholders on january   – just a short time before the deadline for the submission of shareholder proposals and nomination of director candidates for the  annual meeting it is clear from the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the obagi poison pill that it is not as mr hummel claimed in his transmittal letter to shareholders designed to “guard against abusive tactics to gain control of the company” nor to prevent “unfair treatment by an acquirer” likewise it is disingenuous for mr hummel to defend the poison pill as “intended to encourage anyone seeking to control or acquire the company to negotiate with the board” when we believe the board steadfastly refuses to engage in such negotiations with anyone who approaches it and has spurned all such overtures in this context the adoption of the poison pill appears to be a desperate move by the board to send a signal that obagi is not for sale at any price and to stifle further acquisition interest we call upon the board to commit irrevocably to bring the poison pill to a shareholder vote at the  annual shareholders’ meeting and further commit not to adopt another poison pill nor institute any other antitakeover devices if the shareholders do not ratify the poison pill at that time    as stated at the outset voce’s bias would have been to continue expressing our concerns to obagi outside of public view however the board’s decision to institute a poison pill at this time and in this manner has convinced us that a public airing of these serious issues is necessary furthermore while we invite the board’s response to what we have written and would welcome the opportunity to meet to amplify our concerns our objective is to see that the three demands set forth herein are immediately met to repeat we call for the commencement of a review of the company’s strategic alternatives including good faith consideration of what we believe to be strong strategic interest in acquiring the company the complete overhaul of the obagi board including the immediate removal of messrs fitzgibbons and bartholdson and their replacement with proper independent shareholder representation and the board’s irrevocable commitment that it will put the poison pill to a vote at the  annual meeting and that it will adopt another poison pill or any other antitakeover device should the shareholders not ratify the pill at that time if these actions are not taken we reserve the right to take any and all steps that we believe will unlock value for obagi’s shareholders respectfully yours voce capital management llc by s j daniel plants j daniel plantsmanaging partner contacts voce capital

an end to the company’s subjugation by the corasanti family and demanding that conmed pursue strategic alternatives including a sale of the company the thirteen page letter follows months of detailed research by voce into conmed’s operations and prospects including multiple meetings with the company voce’s letter states that “conmed is a strategically attractive asset trapped within a dysfunctional public vehicle that will never achieve its potential in current form shareholders have witnessed years of subpar operational performance lethargic leadership and missed opportunities serial acquisitions have obscured weak organic growth and provided cover for poor execution as a result conmed today is an overly complex subscale player surrounded by much larger and more successful competitors” voce believes the multigenerational dominion over conmed by its founding family has caused this poor performance it’s been abetted by a toothless board that has tolerated conflicts of interest and sanctioned the misuse of corporate assets voce’s letter continues conmed suffers from a culture of nepotism patronage and dystopian corporate governance that would be corrosive in a

including meetings in utica san francisco and new york city this has assisted us as we’ve analyzed conmed’s businesses operations and prospects the conclusion of our research is that conmed is a strategically attractive asset trapped within a dysfunctional public vehicle that will never achieve its potential in current form your shareholders have witnessed years of subpar operational performance lethargic leadership and missed opportunities serial acquisitions have obscured weak organic growth and provided cover for poor execution as a result conmed today is an overly complex subscale player surrounded by much larger and more successful competitors its margins and returns are comparatively weak and in longterm decline perhaps most disturbing conmed suffers from a culture of nepotism patronage and dystopian corporate governance that would be corrosive in a closelyheld corporation but which is utterly corrupting in a public company and therein lies the wellspring for so many of conmed’s failures conmed is unquestionably familyrun – the corasanti clan members pull all the strings and pamper themselves royally – yet it’s not familyowned as they hold very little of its stock their hegemony over conmed could have never occurred without the docile cooperation of the very fiduciaries who were elected to protect shareholder interests you its board of directors    any analysis of conmed’s corporate governance must begin with the recognition that until july of this year its board of directors has been inhabited exclusively by denizens of utica new york lest we receive hate mail from the utica chamber of commerce we preface our comments with nothing but kind words for this fine burg of  souls astride the mohawk river in central new york conmed was founded there in  and it has remained the headquarters since yet the conmed of today is far different from  years ago as the ceo’s statement on the website proclaims “beginning as a small private company manufacturing ecg monitoring electrodes we have become a large publicly held and diversified medical device organization … with approximately  of the companys revenues generated in the united states and  from other worldwide locations” unfortunately conmed’s corporate governance has not kept pace with this evolution given the level of influence wielded by the family one could be forgiven for thinking that the company’s name is corasanti corporation conmed’s patriarch eugene r corasanti stepped down as ceo in  after installing his son joseph j corasanti esq as his replacement the elder mr corasanti is now  years old yet continues as chairman of the board a position he’s held since inception as chairman he’s paid an annual retainer twice what an ordinary director would receive he simultaneously serves as the company’s vice chairman pursuant to a separate employment agreement and receives an additional salary of more than  per year and equity compensation which in  totaled almost  for making himself “available to advise the chief executive officer” ie his son isn’t that what all directors are supposed to do as part of their job but it doesn’t stop there e corasanti is collecting  million of deferred compensation as if he had retired in  even though as a current employee of the company he’s not retired and otherwise would not be entitled to receive it at this time he also continues to enjoy “an automobile allowance club memberships and life and health insurance benefits” these benefits continue “during e corasanti’s life and the life of his wife” mrs corasanti’s specific contributions to conmed’s success are unclear to us like his father j corasanti has a pretty nice gig his annual compensation is approximately  million just like dad he earns additional payments for his board service – despite the fact that he’s also an employee this is both inappropriate and unnecessary given how handsomely he’s already paid as ceo the company continues to carry as a loan to father and son premiums paid by conmed to purchase multimillion “splitdollar” life insurance policies for their benefit in addition to the other perquisites lavished on top conmed executives j corasanti also has access to special life and health insurance policies and benefits for himself and his wife should she outlive him coincidentally just like her motherinlaw and finally he’s protected by a generous mm golden parachute the apple they say never falls far from the tree conmed’s employment practices reveal an alarming degree of nepotism and cronysim for starters was j corasanti – the family scion and a former attorney – really the best choice to replace e corasanti one wonders whether there might have been candidates from outside the company – or at least from outside the family – better suited to run a complex global medical device operation such as conmed apparently j corasanti beat out at least one other candidate for the job his brother david corasanti who also works at conmed given conmed’s serial acquisitions we also respectfully question whether william w abraham remains the optimal choice to lead conmed’s corporate and business development activities – at age  were mr abraham to retire he’d still be able to keep close tabs on conmed as he has two sonsin law employed by the company and while the company hasn’t disclosed it in its filings we’ve learned that j corasanti’s sisterinlaw is also a member of conmed’s senior management team heather l cohen is “executive vice president human resources deputy general counsel and secretary” in this role she’s involved in managing the personnel dynamics and conflicts of interest at conmed including those between the corasantis and the company – despite the fact that ms cohen herself is part of the family we fail to see how she can discharge these responsibilities impartially and we particularly can’t understand how conmed believes this isn’t material enough to warrant disclosure the boundary between business and personal expenses at conmed is quite blurry several of the top executives are furnished with munificent perquisites such as country club memberships automobile leases and special insurance policies there’s also a tradition of conmed making payments to related parties such as to e corasanti’s brotherinlaw to j corasanti’s fatherinlaw and brotherinlaw and to the law firm of a former director robert e remmell throughout his tenure on the board most recently j corasanti used conmed assets to promote the book of his wife michelle cohen corasanti including the use of his staff’s time corporate letterhead and company email accounts shareholders wonder where the line is drawn between the assets of conmed and the interests of the corasanti family or if there’s a line at all with all this incestuous behavior one might suppose corasanti  co feel entitled because they own most of conmed’s equity yet taken together messrs corasanti senior and junior collectively own  of conmed’s common stock even if credited with the various options and other compensation awards they’ve granted themselves over the years the total is still only  as for the rest of the directors they collectively own about   including options in the past  years only two directors have ever bought a share of stock with their own money – for a grand total of  shares purchased  of which occurred in june of this year when a new director joined mr daniels is a case in point at age  he has inhabited the board since  and chairs the audit committee yet holds  shares of common stock the board’s lack of alignment with shareholders coddling of management and toothless oversight is highly relevant to the review of conmed’s strategic positioning and financial and operational performance which we take up next in turn    conmed’s essentially a rollup since inception it has completed  acquisitions totaling more than  billion in the past decade conmed’s organic growth has been only  per annum and its market capitalization is less than what it collectively cost to acquire these businesses the company has had to pay increasing multiples over time to get deals done as the acquisition market has grown more competitive and the number of targets has declined its one truly successful acquisition linvatec occurred over  years ago at the same time conmed has never divested anything units like patient care – the legacy business on which e corasanti founded conmed from his kitchen table in the s – appears to have more sentimental than economic value with commoditized products negative growth and operating losses management insists it needs to maintain the full portfolio of six businesses to absorb some  million of corporate overhead but that simply begs the question as to whether corporate overhead is too high it also illustrates how woefully subscale conmed’s core businesses are the sheer complexity of its empire particularly for such a relatively small firm has proved challenging to manage conmed competes in six different categories with five separate salesforces this sprawling enterprise has required semiregular reshuffling as the company has experimented with managerial reporting and distribution models by vertical by horizontal and by geography that’s led to frequent restructuring charges and writeoffs the shotgun approach has also disadvantaged conmed competitively conmed’s  or  in most categories and  in another but it’s not  in any of its six major business lines within each segment conmed competes against much larger competitors and not a single one of them despite their far greater resources has elected to compete across more than three of the verticals chosen by conmed the size of its core businesses has limited conmed’s ability to bundle and crosssell a key strategy larger competitors also increasingly use to counteract shifts in healthcare spending its competitors invest far greater sums in rd and as we shall see its lack of scale in its core businesses and mishmash of other endeavors has impacted conmed’s financial performance    conmed’s stated financial goals are simple the “companys revenue growth should outpace operating expense growth thus creating margin and bottomline expansion in excess of topline growth” central to that are “our efforts to grow the topline and improve our gross margins through the introduction of new products” in the last ten years conmed’s organic growth has slowed considerably from high single digits early in the prior decade to essentially flat to down this decade these results significantly underperform orthopedic industry leaders such as smith  nephew stryker and zimmer zooming in on  conmed is the only one of its peers to report negative revenue growth what’s more conmed has consistently overestimated its revenue growth sapping the confidence of the investment community starting in  conmed was late recognizing and responding to the global recession and way too early calling its conclusion it reiterated wildly unrealistic q and fy projections as late as october   which it subsequently missed by a mile throughout  conmed declared the worst was behind it yet went on to fall short of its revenue guidance for fy  in february  it confidently announced “the economic effects on the company had reached a welcome turning point” and in july went on to say “our business is stabilizing and returning to a state of steady consistent growth” yet conmed missed both its q and q revenue targets q actually shrank  yearoveryear as a result conmed subsequently fell short of its full year  revenue guidance then missed it again in …and yet again in  while  is not formally over it’s not too early to write its epitaph because management has already lowered its full year revenue target below the bottom end of its original forecast – making six straight years conmed has missed its revenue projections these trends were on full display again with conmed’s q results revenues actually declined  year on year missing the company’s guidance as well as every analyst’s estimate which had already been progressively lowered throughout the year conmed cut its fy  guidance – again – and introduced a q revenue target the midpoint of which implies revenue will fall even faster in q  than in q this is particularly striking when compared to the results of the other orthopedic companies who have just reported all of which are growing nicely for example smith  nephew’s sports medicine business a direct conmed competitor grew  each has its own mix of business but all are fundamentally levered to the same reconstruction market as conmed analysts estimate this market is growing at approximately  worldwide while conmed is shrinking conmed used to be satisfied keeping pace with the market but now it’s slowly but surely falling behind drooping revenues in a rising market means only one thing conmed is losing share conmed’s strategic disadvantages have also manifested themselves in structurally inferior margins and returns on capital ten years ago conmed’s operating margins were in the high teens similar to smith  nephew’s and stryker’s zimmer’s were considerably higher then and still are near  today conmed’s margins have fallen to about  while stryker and smith  nephew hover in the low s consider this not only are conmed’s operating margins lower today than they were a decade ago despite revenues having grown by  during this time but its operating income dollars are also lower now conmed management has long boasted of its plan to reverse this trend by achieving “adjusted” operating margins of  not only has it been ten years since it last achieved that level  but the commitment itself has been an evermoving target in october of  for example the cfo mr shallish said “our goal is to achieve operating margins in the low to midteens in approximately three to four years” ie  j corasanti peddled the same promise throughout the  fall conference season saying in september “our profit goal for conmed is to improve our operating margins to     we can achieve this operating profit goal in  or  years” ie  in october  he said we’re so focused now on moving this operating margin up we’re trying to get  basis points a year    if that operating margin moves up to our target goal of  we are talking about a massive increase in eps and i would expect that to translate on a very large increase in our share price on the q earnings call management stood firm on a  basis point expansion in margin for  but by october of  they retreated forecasting only  basis points for  and  for  despite this significant setback by may of this year j corasanti was back on script “so our corporate goal in terms of profitability    is to achieve  operating margin probably in the next three or four years” ie “probably” around  even more outlandish than management’s constantly shifting operating targets is the embellishment of its success in increasing margins according to j corasanti in november  “we are focused on increasing our operating margin we have a stated goal of  and    about  basis points annually and we’ve done a nice job of that over the last couple of years” really conmed’s adjusted operating margin bottomed at  in  in part because it was so late in removing costs during the recession management then massaged the “adjusted” operating income each year thereafter by adding back all manner of items including restructuring costs every single year and either an inventory adjustment or acquisition related cost in every year as well and there were several other addbacks too even with all of these credits “adjusted” operating margins grew from an artificially depressed  in  to  in  to  in  to  in  and are expected to be  in  excluding the medical device tax at these levels it remains very far away from the holy grail of  closer inspection reveals that management’s “adjustments” neglected items artificially propping up the margins first the company’s acquisition of exclusive rights to mtf’s tissue in  significantly boosted margins as it’s a revenue commission with virtually no cost of goods to conmed second management slashed rd sequentially each year – from  of sales in  to about  in  it will either continue to do so to buttress margins a trend that has alarmed the investment community worried about the effects of underinvestment or reverse course and normalize rd becoming yet another headwind for margins if one corrects management’s “adjusted” operating margin for these two items the picture looks much different increasing a mere  basis points over four years    according to j corasanti “one of the key points of conmed’s corporate strategy is to expand our margins through introduction of new products” the best way to evaluate this claim is to review the launch of altrus easily the most important new product in conmed’s history altrus is conmed’s entry into the  billion tissue sealing market a high margin category growing  per year conmed already has a leading position in electrosurgery anchored by its  position with a  share in tissue cutting so the opportunity to leverage that position with the same surgeon to seal the same tissue is compelling and conmed spent millions of dollars developing altrus for this very reason if conmed could attain even a fraction of the penetration it has in its core electrosurgery business altrus would be a homerun easily becoming conmed’s largest product yet for a company that prides itself on the development and commercialization of important new products altrus has been a manufacturing regulatory and sales debacle for the better part of six years as early as april  conmed told shareholders to expect an altrus launch “later this year” and in july of  predicted “a fairly significant ramp of tissue sealing in ” yet by october management began backpedaling pushing the launch out until spring  by the next earnings call in february  altrus was further delayed until q in april  altrus was “still on target for our third quarter release” but then in july it had slipped again “we’re hopeful that we can get the tissuesealing product out early next year ” for the first time management acknowledged it was experiencing production issues with altrus in october  management reassured shareholders it had a handle on them and that it would launch by the end of h a promise it reiterated on the subsequent two earnings calls but in  regulatory problems appeared in april management disclosed it had filed its k applications and hoped to have clearance to begin selling altrus by summer yet when july arrived management cited unanticipated delays receiving fda clearance which continued to linger when conmed reported in october  although it eventually received the us approval in november  in july  management revealed still more regulatory snafus citing delays in approvals outside of the us principally europe and canada in february  management guided to  million in  revenues for altrus in addition to regulatory delays by april  there were new manufacturing breakdowns retarding the relaunch causing management to dial the  revenue expectations down to  million in october management spoke of further glitches specifically a muffed sales launch during summer vacation schedules it slashed the  forecast yet again to  million but predicted  sales of  million these forecasts were reiterated in november and management introduced a goal of  market share ie  million altrus’s final  sales “slightly less than  million” in february  j corasanti claimed “altrus is proceeding very very well” and reiterated the  million revenue guidance but two months later management hedged again saying the launch was “not moving as fast as we thought” and blamed “continuing manufacturing difficulties” owing to its “being a complicated product to produce” all product shipping ceased for several weeks despite reconfirming the revenue guidance at that time management dropped it again in july to  million in october the salesforce reemerged as the scapegoat as management blamed poor training for fresh setbacks it also alluded to new commercial challenges admitting “we are going to have to start now to pay attention to gpo contracts” as if that were news it whacked revenue guidance again to  million by february  management was confidently forecasting  million again in altrus revenues but just as in prior years by april  management retreated and cut its forecast once more to  million for the first time management cited pricing pressures on altrus – surprising indeed given management’s longheld insistence that it could displace incumbents covidien and johnson  johnson with a premiumpriced product conmed stubbornly clung to pricing altrus at  per tip despite a widespread view that covidien was delivering an effective price through bundling and discounts of almost  of that on its marketleading ligasure product we don’t take issue with management’s belief in the technological superiority of altrus but we question its judgment in trying to displace a deeply entrenched competitor with a product priced at such a rich premium regardless of its efficacy in may management conceded that altrus has a “longer selling cycle … than we expected” by july management referred again to pricing compression and for the first time suggested they were encountering resistance from purchasing managers due to a lack of clinical preference making this simply the latest gaffe in the neverending altrus comedy of errors conmed refused to provide any  revenue guidance for altrus on the q call but we estimate that altrus’ lifetimetodate revenues since  are generously about  million – a market penetration of at most     these collective strategic financial and operational issues have all taken a toll on conmed’s shareholders as the below chart illustrates conmed’s stock has underperformed over most time periods and in some cases dramatically so when compared to the median performance of its core orthopedic competitors selfidentified peers from the company’s proxy and the russell  index of which it’s a member   one year   two years   three years   five years   ten years             conmed      core orthopedic competitors      conmeddefined peer group      russell         we acknowledge that conmed’s stock price performance has improved somewhat of late appreciating about  this year while respectable that’s essentially in line with its peers and the index most importantly its revenue and earnings estimates have fallen consistently throughout  meaning conmed’s valuation multiples have expanded faster than its stock price despite its current poor fundamentals and limited visibility conmed trades for x the midpoint of management’s  earnings estimate assuming they actually meet it that’s near the largest premium conmed has ever traded versus its orthopedic peers which change hands for about x  earnings – an especially wide gap in light of the fact they’re much larger growing faster and reap meaningfully higher margins and while its peers have also seen multiple expansion this year it’s been in the context of revenue growth and heightened comfort with their prospects – not the other way around as with conmed so what explains the anomalous improvement in conmed’s stock recently it must be viewed in the context of simmering shareholder discontent which culminated on conmed’s q earnings call on july  during qa one of the company’s largest shareholders – a long time owner and highly respected investor – posed the following question “but i just wonder why it’s not in the shareholders’ best interest to maybe hire a bank and see whether a strategic might surface that would rectify the  or greater discount the company is currently bearing in the public markets versus what the private markets might bear” the collective expectation of changes at conmed has clearly buoyed the stock conmed was underperforming before the july  earnings call and has significantly outperformed since despite flubbing both q and q   preq call   postq call       conmed   core orthopedic competitors   conmeddefined peer group   russell      the market believes there’s an attractive sale option available to conmed and that the odds of it occurring have increased it has bid the stock accordingly we tend to agree    while conmed has chosen to remain until now a standalone company and to manage a disparate portfolio the rest of the industry has consolidated ma in medtech generally and orthopedics specifically has been on a rampage with high multiples being paid for strategic acquisitions competitors jj smith  nephew stryker zimmer and biomet have all been active recent acquirors in this space thirteen transactions totaling approximately  billion have occurred within orthopedics in the last  months alone conmed’s principal attraction is that it’s one of only three players with a fullline of sports medicine products an attractive growth area within orthopedics we estimate that  of conmed’s revenues and  of its ebitda derive from this business and that it constitutes the substantial majority of the company’s value almost  of its total revenues are singleuse disposables rather than capital equipment another desirable trait in this uncertain economic environment there are many companies for whom we believe conmed is strategically attractive prime among them would be zimmer a small player in sports medicine today who has identified this as a focus going forward moreover zimmer actually owned conmed’s orthopedic business linvatec prior to zimmer’s spinoff from bristolmyers squibb and continues to serve as linvatec’s distribution partner it’s unclear why bristol separated the sports medicine and tools business from the implants in the first place but it’s wellknown that zimmer now believes it needs its own line of power tools and procedurespecific instruments – which happen to be one of conmed’s strengths or consider stryker where conmed would nicely fill out its arthroscopy offerings stryker is an aggressive acquiror that recently paid  billion to buy mako surgical and  million to purchase trauson while there is some product overlap in power tools each is stronger in different parts of the world smith  nephew on the other hand has a strong arthroscopy franchise but lacks the depth in power tools offered by conmed then there’s biomet a  billion private company backed by top private equity firms which has a number of holes in arthroscopy conmed’s shoulder restoration system for example would be of particular value to it privatelyheld arthrex reportedly larger than conmed is another possibility jj the world’s largest orthopedics business is also intriguing conmed would not only complement the depuy synthes businesses but jj would also be interested in conmed’s general surgery units given its strengths in those areas too similarly covidien competes in endosurgery electrosurgery and patient care covidien would certainly not want to see altrus fall into the hands of a more capable rival diversified players such as bard boston scientific danaher medtronic teleflex and m to name just a few are all serial acquirers and could be buyers of conmed as they compete in one or more of its segments several of these companies have approached conmed but been turned away transaction multiples within orthopedics vary but it’s hard to find any less than double digit multiples of forward ebitda typically between x such valuations are well supported by the synergies observed in these strategic transactions with efficiencies across the entire income statement the midpoint would imply a  price for conmed a  premium to its current trading range and given their relative size every one of these potential acquirors could buy conmed for cash and realize eps accretion in most cases materially so in the first year based on previous transactions cost synergies alone could exceed  million that implies that an acquisition of conmed at a headline multiple of x ebitda is really more like x – easily doable and a winwin for all involved    on the most recent earnings call j corasanti conceded that the company’s results and guidance are “disappointing to me and the entire senior management team at conmed” conmed’s shareholders are more than just disappointed with significant value embedded in the business and a white hot transaction market a sale of conmed could fetch a king’s ransom why does conmed refuse to even consider this possibility perhaps one clue to its motivations is that despite its history of empire building through acquisitions conmed has never divested a single asset perhaps another is a perception held by some acquirers that dynastic family control stands as a moat around conmed impeding its capture a sale would indeed mark the end of the corasanti reign but it would unlock tremendous value for the true owners of conmed’s realm its shareholders the time has come for the corasanti family to abdicate the conmed throne and the commencement of a proper process to find a suitor for conmed would be the right first step in that direction make no mistake should you fail to act we are preserving the full range of options at our disposal to protect shareholder interests respectfully yours voce capital management llc by   s j daniel plants   j daniel plants managing partner    conmed added two new directors at the end of july immediately following this year’s annual meeting  not a single company identified in conmed’s proxy as a peer for compensation purposes pays its ceo a separate fee for serving as a director  the almond tree garnet publishing  a selfdescribed “uplifting read which respectfully travels a controversial history and delivers an enriching experience that is a testament to the human spirit and a hope for peace”  conmed has recently reorganized again by combining its two weakest businesses patient care and endoscopic technologies with the electrosurgery and endosurgery lines this will cloak the poor results of the laggard businesses and make it more difficult for investors to analyze conmed  it’s worth noting a string of other cavalier predictions conmed has made along the way for example while everyone in the industry longago braced for the impact of the medical device tax j corasanti dismissed this looming hit blithely claiming for several quarters conmed would simply pass it along to customers by raising prices or tacking it onto the invoice – preposterous in this environment yet by the q call conmed had changed its tune and began blaming its failures on “headwinds driven principally by the medical device tax” by april  j corasanti claimed the “impact of the medical device tax    were headwinds we expected” as if he had seen it coming all along  similarly conmed priced itself out of the sequent opportunity eventually conceding that sequent’s modest success relative to its initial lofty expectations was due to customer belief that it was too expensive  while altrus is by far conmed’s biggest missed opportunity there are plenty of others after several years of empty promises and an estimated  million of investment including an acquisition management recently gave up the ghost on ecom another ballyhooed new product with huge potential but whose revenues never exceeded  management has also acknowledged that part of the culprit for its falling capital equipment sales is that it’s over a year late in bringing its nextgeneration d video product to market conmed only launched four new products in   smith  nephew stryker and zimmer  conmed’s proxy identifies the following peers cooper companies genprobe greatbatch haemonetics idexx integra lifesciences masimo orthofix resmed sirona dental systems steris west pharmaceutical wright medical and zoll medical we leave for another time discussion of whether this is an appropriate sample set  two of the fourteen peers conmed identifies in its proxy have been acquired within the past year and almost   have been bought since conmed started disclosing peers in  this reveals a survivor bias in the remaining comparisons – the acquired companies and takeout premiums are all excluded making the bar easier for conmed to clear – but it also illustrates the surging consolidation wave that conmed continues to miss  this includes the impact of the medical device tax which conmed excludes from its adjusted eps despite the fact that none of its peers do  this says nothing of the potential value that could be created from altrus and other inchoate conmed opportunities in the hands of a more skillful operator
