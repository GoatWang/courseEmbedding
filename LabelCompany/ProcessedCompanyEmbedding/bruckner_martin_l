early american cartographiesbrückner martinchapel hill nc univ of north carolina press  ​the fourteen essays in early american cartographies examine indigenous and european peoples creation and use of maps to better represent and understand the world they inhabited drawing from both current historical interpretations and new interdisciplinary perspectives this collection provides diverse approaches to understanding the multilayered exchanges that went into creating cartographic knowledge in and about the americas in the introduction editor martin brückner provides a critical assessment of the concept of cartography and of the historiography of maps the individual essays then range widely over space and place from the imperial reach of iberian and british cartography to indigenous conceptualizations including dirty ephemeral maps and star charts to demonstrate that prenineteenthcentury american cartography was at once a multiform and multicultural affair this volume not only highlights the collaborative genesis of cartographic knowledge about the early americas the essays also bring to light original archives and innovative methodologies for investigating spatial relations among peoples in the western hemisphere taken together the authors reveal the roles of early american cartographies in shaping popular notions of national space informing visual perception

brückner martin hsuan l hsunewark de university of delaware press  ​this interdisciplinary collection of essays explores intersections between geography and american literary history from the earliest geographic chronicles of the new world to the massive geopolitical imaginings of the s by foregrounding the unsteady nature of geographical boundaries the physical and imaginary migrations that coexisted with literary nationalism and the changing attitudes toward geographical settings the essays in american literary geographies present textual theoretical and contextual alternatives to existing exceptionalist accounts of us culture beginning with studies of the establishment of names borders and jurisdictions the collection builds toward materialist readings of literary settings illuminated by maps surveying tracts travelogues sailors epitaphs and various forms of racialized or gendered mobility the focus on the literary and geographical discourse addresses more than social and political developments like imperialism regionalism and tourism rather this volume seeks to supplement literary histories by emphasizing spatial over temporal strategies as the organizing

carolina press  ​winner of the  louis gottschalk prize american society for eighteenthcentury studies the rapid rise in popularity of maps and geography handbooks in the eighteenth century ushered in a new geographic literacy among americans living in north america in a pathbreaking and richly illustrated examination of this transformation martin bruckner argues that geographic literacy as it was played out in popular literary genres–written for example by william byrd george washington thomas jefferson royall tyler charles brockden brown meriwether lewis and william clark–significantly influenced identity formation in america from the s to the s drawing on historical geography cartography literary history and material culture brückner recovers a vibrant culture of geography consisting of property plats and surveying manuals decorative wall maps and school geographies the nations first atlases and sentimental objects such as needlework samplers by showing how this geographic revolution affected the production of literature bruckner demonstrates that the internalization of geography as a kind of language helped shape the literary construction of the modern american subject empirically rich and provocative in its readings the geographic revolution in early america proposes a new geographical basis for angloamericans understanding of their character and its expression in pedagogical and literary terms buy it     programsundergraduategraduatewriting  udjournalismapplyabout the departmentpeopleresearch  teachingnewseventsmemorial hallget
