representation required in the boardroom immediately jan   am est houston jan   prnewswire  jcp investment management llc together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation collectively jcp or we collectively one of the largest stockholders of fiesta restaurant group inc fiesta or the company nasdaq frgi with aggregate ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding shares announced today that it has formally nominated three independent highly qualified candidates john b morlock james c pappas and joshua e schechter for election to the companys board of directors the board at the companys upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders the annual meeting over the past several months jcp has attempted to reach an amicable resolution with the company regarding the composition of the board and certain corporate governance matters however the incumbent board and management team have refused to engage meaningfully with us leaving us little choice but to nominate a competing slate of director candidates at the annual meeting who we believe will create value for all stockholders jcp is concerned by the massive decline in value that fiesta stockholders have suffered over the past several years a prime example of stockholder value destruction is the boards misguided decision to allocate more than  million for pollo tropicals failed expansion into texas we further believe that taco cabana has significant value and growth potential which the incumbent board and management team has apparently failed to recognize or at a minimum to capitalize upon following the departure of former ceo timothy taft in september  stockholders have been left with a company without a permanent ceo that is being run by a board with minimal share ownership and scant restaurant operating experience adding to uncertainty for stockholders is the persistent rumor of a strategic review process prior to any significant action such as the hiring of a permanent ceo or pursuing a sale of the company jcp strongly believes that the board must be reconstituted with direct stockholder representatives and experienced restaurant operators jcps director candidates collectively bring not only significant operating experience in the restaurant industry but a strong track record of creating stockholder value jcps nominees who have the highest commitment

reblogsharetweetsharehouston april   prnewswire  jcp investment management llc together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation collectively jcp or we collectively one of the largest stockholders of fiesta restaurant group inc fiesta or the company frgi with aggregate ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding shares today issued a letter to the chairman of fiestas board of directors the full text of the letter followsapril  fiesta restaurant group inc  landmark boulevard suite  dallas texas  attn    stacey rauch chairman of the boarddear staceyas you know we own approximately  of the outstanding shares of fiesta restaurant group inc fiesta or the company making us the companys third largest stockholder dating back to august of last year we have sought to work constructively with fiestas board of directors the board and management team in an effort to drive stockholder value and improve the companys corporate governance following the companys apparent unwillingness to entertain serious discussions regarding board refreshment we nominated a slate of three highly qualified individuals for election to the board at the upcoming annual meeting that we believe would greatly enhance the boarddespite our nomination we continued to seek an amicable resolution with the board in an effort to avoid an expensive and time consuming proxy contest unfortunately we do not believe that the boards recent offer adequately addresses the shortcomings of the composition of the board or protects the best interests of the companys stockholdersthe driving factor behind our belief is the makeup of the current sevenmember board six of the seven incumbent directors have overseen a  decline in fiestas share price from its  peak and under their leadership the companys total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one two and threeyear periods these same directors authorized the expenditure of more than  million on the failed expansion of pollo tropical into texas and oversaw a corporate structure with bloated sga expenses including three corporate centers in addition the recent performance of the company is concerning with transaction counts down  and  respectively at taco cabana and pollo tropical in the fourth quarter of   furthermore the board consists largely of directors with little to no industry operating experience nor any personal investment in fiesta stock in fact paul e twohig who was just appointed as a director effective february   is the only director who has made an open market purchase of fiesta shares in addition we note that three of the seven directors are affiliated with jefferies including directors barry j alperin and brian p friedman who are up for election at the upcoming annual meeting it should be noted that jefferies sold its entire position in  after previously owning approximately  of the company at the time of its spinoff in while we welcome the appointment of mr twohig to the board who we believe is independent and brings considerable industry expertise we do not think his addition alone is sufficient to offset the lack of industry experience and apparent misalignment of interests between the incumbent directors and fiestas stockholdersas such we find the boards recent offer contemplating the addition of one of our candidates now and a separate individual to be identified by the board at a later date to be unacceptable given the lack of assurance that the person selected would be mutually agreeable to both parties in addition we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a multiyear standstill period given the current classified board structure because we believe this would effectively serve to further entrench the incumbent directors who have overseen significant destruction of stockholder value  we strongly believe that any potential agreement must involve the immediate addition of two highly qualified director candidates who together will bring significant operating experience and an owners perspective into the boardroom we believe adding such individuals to the board would remedy the boards apparent lack of restaurant expertise and avoid a seemingly unnecessary election contest which we believe could only benefit the entrenched directors who we do not believe belong on the board therefore to simplify the choice for stockholders at the upcoming annual meeting we intend to withdraw our nomination of joshua e schechter and seek the election of our remaining candidates james c pappas and john b morlock both of whom have significant experience in the restaurant industry in opposition to messrs alperin and friedmanread morewhile we remain open to a collaborative process regarding board composition we are fully prepared to see this through to a vote at the upcoming annual meeting if necessary to ensure that stockholders have the opportunity to vote for the most highly qualified candidates to represent their interestswe look forward to your prompt responsesincerelyjames c pappascertain information concerning the participantsjcp investment management llc together with the other participants named herein
