jobs while providing a lucrative paydayhis bestknown bet was in the steel industry more than a decade ago a time when few wanted anything to do with it mr ross cobbled together the ailing assets of ltv and bethlehem steel into a new company called international steel group which was sold in  to mittal steel for  billion“there were no outsiders who were willing to step forward and make an

preferred to see himself as another kind of bird — the mythical phoenix helping businesses rise from the ashesto some degree mr ross helped mr trump do that when some of his casinos in atlantic city fell on hard times mr ross and carl c icahn another billionaire investor and supporter of mr trump were both bondholders in the trump taj mahal casino when it was teetering on financial collapse in  instead of pushing the casino into an immediate bankruptcy mr ross and mr icahn worked with mr trump and others to structure a more orderly bankruptcy filing in the negotiated restructuring helped mr trump salvage his name and brand at a time when he arguably did not have many friends on wall streetthe low point of mr ross’s career was the deadly mine disaster in west virginia although he helped set up a charitable fund for the families of the victims and his company contributed more than  million to them as well some in organized labor remain bitter about mr ross and his firmstill that episode has not deterred some unions from doing business with him when it was in their interest in  mr ross was one of the wealthy investors who gave a  million cash infusion to amalgamated bank one of the nation’s largest unionowned lenders which was struggling to stay in business after the financial crisis advertisement continue reading the main story an affiliate of the service employees

later tell new york magazine “gave one a very closeup view of politics” ms mccaughey too was named to mr trump’s economic team during the campaignsome suggest mr ross’s business ties may pose potential conflicts of interest but the sale of his company wl ross may make it easier for mr ross to separate himself from its farflung interests which include businesses in europe china and india his remaining financial interests in the firm’s funds could be put in a blind trust and he could easily resign from the five corporate boards on which he sitsstill those overseas deals could raise questions about his relationships with foreign leaders and businesspeople from china and russiahe is vice chairman of the bank of cyprus the biggest bank in that european island nation and he is

community” ross said in his confirmation hearing before the senate commerce committee on jan  “i think we should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete those who do not should not get away with it they should be punished and severely” he said the commerce department has more than  employees and

billionaire  wilbur l ross jr  best known for restructuring failed companies in the steel industry and other sectors  was elected as vice chairman of the bank of cypress ross joined a newly constituted board to help the embattled institution complete a turnaround after cypress was rocked by a greek debt crisis his buyout shop wl ross  co llc owns a  stake in a statement ross noted at the time that due to new european rules limiting directorships of bank officers that he was resigning from the boards of several other companies including assured guaranty international automotive components group international textile group  itxn navigator holdings  nvgs talmer bancorp   tlmr and embattled mortgage debt collector ocwen financial   ocn  however according to a compilation of data by deal affiliate boardex ross still sits on at least five public company boards arcelormittal  mt the world largest steel company the bank of cypress exco resources   xco sun national bank  snbc and a special purpose acquisition company or spac for wl ross holding   wlrhu    at the same time he is executive director or supervisory director at privately held diamond shipping a tanker company where wl ross is a major stakeholder and he holds the nonexecutive chairman position    on top of that ross is a member of the investment committee for asiafocused activist investor the taiyo fund lp a joint venture between wl ross the california public employees retirement system and a team investing in japan he also is a trustee at the brookings institution a washington think tank the palm beach civic association and the board of the yale school of management where he studied as well as several other other nonprofits in all boardex reports that ross serves roughly  boards committees and clubs a number that is substantial though significantly down from a few years ago thats still too many according to governance experts and restructuring specialists kurt s schulzke director of law ethics and regulation at the kennesaw state university corporate governance center said there is no question that ross is overboarded there is plenty of data out there to support the notion that for a top executive to sit on more than two or three boards is excessive schulzke said there is no way one can absorb synthesize and analyze the company when you are sitting on so many boards   ross defends his directorships telling the deal that all the forprofit boards he sits on represent present or former portfolio companies he added that participating on boards and influencing the direction of companies is an important component of the business model for wl ross  co the private equity firm he founded in  in some particularly active situations i might be on the phone or in physical meetings with management several times a week ross told the deal we also interact informally with managements between meetings invesco  ivz a money manager based in atlanta acquired wl ross in  ross stepped down from daytoday management of wl ross  co last year and is currently chairman and chief strategy officer clearly still a top position at the firm the buyout shop has two senior managing directors that are coleaders of the firm  which no longer employs the ceo title now that i am less involved in the day to day affairs of the wl ross business i have even more time available ross said ross suggested that there is a big difference between a top executive of a public company sitting on a number of other boards and his situation where wl ross owns stakes in public and private companies we are major stakeholders in companies and are active not passive managers ross said an executive from a nonprivate equity firm would not have as much time to devote to boards as i do because for such a person an outside directorship is just a side line being on multiple boards ross added exposes individuals to a wide range of management practices and relationships between board and management you can perhaps imagine the breadth of experience that serving on so many and such diverse boards enables me to bring to portfolio companies he said however governance experts said they dont buy that richer knowledge base justification for multiple board seats schulzke acknowledges that many individuals who have multiple directorships make the argument that being a director at so many companies allows them to work from a broader grasp of the markets and corporations in general he argues that the individual still has to physically spend the time to understand and provide adequate oversight to each of the companies unless you have a deal with dr who to let you travel back in time it is a mystery to me how someone can serve on five or six or seven public company boards and do their job effectively

vowed on wednesday to make sweeping changes to the north american free trade agreement his top priority as the incoming administration moves to overhaul its commercial partnerships around the worldmr trump made nafta one of his favorite targets of derision during the presidential campaign using it to blame democrats for the loss of millions of industrial jobs at his senate confirmation hearing on wednesday mr ross made it clear that the united states’ northern and southern neighbors should prepare to renegotiate a pact that for decades has eased the flow of commerce among the countries he said “all aspects” of the agreement were on the table“as to canada and mexico the presidentelect has made no secret in his public remarks nor have i that nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with” said mr ross who will take a leading role in executing mr trump’s trade agenda “we ought to solidify relationships the best way we can in our own territory before we go off into other jurisdictions”next on his list could be china mr ross suggested as he assailed the country’s high tariffs and what he described as empty claims of embracing free trade mr ross said he wanted to bring “the reality closer to the rhetoric” when it comes to china advertisement continue reading the main story “china is the most protectionist country of the very large countries” he said “they talk more about free trade than they actually practice” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but in spite of his promises to crack down on countries that are cheating on trade mr ross also tried to assuage concerns that mr trump’s “america first” philosophy will lead to protectionism and potentially economic disaster“i am not antitrade” mr ross insisted “i am protrade but i am prosensible trade”as for the tariffs that mr trump has called for imposing on some imports mr ross said he had learned the lessons of the smoothawley tariff act which raised import taxes on thousands of goods in the s and is widely believed to have extended the great depressionthe act “didn’t work very well then and it very likely wouldn’t work now” mr ross saidsenator dan sullivan republican of alaska said he was worried that some of mr trump’s more provocative ideas like a  percent tax on companies that sell products in the united states but manufacture them elsewhere could be a drag on economic growthmr ross suggested that mr trump a fellow deal maker was simply being a shrewd negotiator“i think the presidentelect has done a wonderful job preconditioning some of the other countries with whom we will be negotiating that change is coming” mr ross saidmr trump has faced criticism for packing his economic team with rich patrons of wall street after running a populist campaign focused on lifting the middle class known in some circles as the “king of bankruptcy” mr ross  made his fortune as a private equity titan who bought and sold the kinds of struggling

said he discovered while preparing for his senate confirmation processmr ross said the employee had presented a social security card and a valid driver’s license both bearing that person’s name when hired in  but during a check over the past month the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation and was fired immediately mr ross said advertisement continue reading the main story “we did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment and it turned out that was incorrect” mr ross saidlike many of mr trump’s cabinet selections mr ross is facing scrutiny for a long business background that raises the potential for conflicts of interest in a filing released this week mr ross indicated that he planned to divest at least  assets and investment funds and step down from dozens of funds and firms in which he has financial stakessome democrats on the committee like senator richard blumenthal of connecticut expressed concern that conflicts of interest could be a problem for the administration because of mr trump’s vast financial portfolio and his refusal to divest his holdings noting the financial sacrifice that mr ross is making by becoming a public servant mr blumenthal asked if mr trump should do the same for the sake of the countrymr ross said that he was not fully aware of the breadth of mr trump’s holdings but

about us privacy terms wilbur ross quotes american  businessman born november     loading there is no evidence that more regulation makes things better the most highly regulated industry in america is commercial banking and that didnt save those institutions from making terrible decisions wilbur ross decisions america better its important to have a sound idea but the really important thing is the implementation wilbur ross important sound idea my wife hillary sometimes accuses me of trying to reinvent the th century in some ways shes right because i like things that i can understand and that arent too complicated wilbur ross wife trying me the one term i dont like to be called is a vulture because to me a vulture is a kind of assetstripper that eats dead flesh off the bones of a dead creature our bird should be the phoenix the bird that reinvents itself recreates itself from its ashes and thats much closer to what it is that we really do wilbur ross bird me kind i think its natural for any manager to want to grow his business the question is at what rate and in what direction and in what format wilbur ross business direction want i dont think theres anything inherently wrong with a bank being big in fact there are some good arguments about universality of geography that in theory if you have all your eggs in one little community and some big employer goes out that could be your downfall wilbur ross good community think banking i would argue is the most heavily regulated industry in the world regulations dont solve things supervision solves things wilbur ross world banking most shipping has a great oversupply of vessels that came from overordering a few years back we think  may be when it turns around wilbur ross great think back you cannot just keep borrowing more and more and keep spending more and more without eventually having a day of reckoning wilbur ross day you more shale gas if left to flourish could create several hundred thousand more jobs wilbur ross create more left i think at the end of the day the real sick man of europe is liable to turn out to be france not greece not portugal not spain not italy the reason is france is very uncompetitive to begin with on a global scale and the measures that hollande has been putting in have been very very negative from the point of view of economic growth wilbur ross growth man day each weekend i play at least one and maybe two sets of tennis a day my doubles team was in the finals recently at my tennis club in palm beach and lost a tiebreaker after a threehour match i must confess by the end of the three hours i was relieved it was over wilbur ross beach team day ships are a strange kind of commodity because theyre very lumpy very big individual units but theyre commodities wilbur ross strange kind ships everybody talks about tariffs as the first thing tariffs are the last thing tariffs are part of the negotiation the real trick is going to be increase american exports get rid of some of the tariff and nontariff barriers to american exports wilbur ross american negotiation real the fact that youre successful doesnt mean that you cant relate to working people wilbur ross successful people working i see myself as a privateequity investor that helps rebuild companies restructuring is a cottage industry in that there arent that many serious practitioners wilbur ross myself see serious generally speaking companies get into bankruptcy as a kind of meritocracy somebody made some sort of big mistake to get into bankruptcy and very often a part of the mistake is too much leverage wilbur ross mistake kind leverage between the community redevelopment act requiring banks to make what i would call very weak loans and specific quotas that the congress imposed on fannie mae and freddie mac that created the market demand that really led to the subprime phenomenon wilbur ross community act weak the typical big japanese company has somewhere between a third and  percent of its revenues coming from developing countries and about a third of japans exports are also to the emerging countries so in a strange way japan which has very little internal growth its big companies are a good way to play the emerging markets wilbur ross good growth strange the fundamentals are the us is going to end up being a net exporter of natural gas thats going to be wonderful to help our balance of payments reduce our dependence on a lot of countries that arent so crazy about us and change many many parts of what goes on here wilbur ross change balance end if you want to do something to destroy consumer spending just eat away at the middle class because the other problem we have is the structural problem of middle class america wilbur ross america problem want mexico has  treaties with other countries that make it very advantageous to do international shipping from mexico rather than from the united states believe it or not mexico has better treaties with the rest of the world than the united states does wilbur ross world believe better the problem with regional trade agreements is you get picked apart by the first country then you negotiate with the second country you get picked apart and you go with the third one you get picked apart again wilbur ross problem you country many of the smaller banks have had to get to the point where they now have more compliance people than they have lending offices thats crazy wilbur ross crazy people more part of the reason why im supporting trump is that i think we need a more radical new approach to government  at least in the us  from what weve had before wilbur ross government why think if you add up all the promises any politician makes the math doesnt work hillary clintons math doesnt work donalds math probably doesnt work i think you have to listen to their campaign pitches more as symbolic more as metaphors wilbur ross work promises think share this page cite this page citation find on amazon
