the call over to jim schoeneck james schoeneck thanks bruce and thank you all for joining us today ill start todays call by reviewing our  business achievements followed by a summary of our financial results ill then outline our  nucynta growth initiatives and then continuing to unlock future value for the franchise and the company augie moretti our cfo will then dig into the results and guidance before i provide closing comments and open the call to questions  was the year of growth challenges and building value in  we set a full year record with net revenue of  million up  over the prior year in fact each of our products achieved the highest revenue in their history in  led by nucynta franchise our progress over the past three years has been dramatic with net product revenue increasing from  million in  to  million in  and  million last year our cash flow and bottom line performance has been even more impressive growing ebitda from  million in  to  million in  and  million in  and all of this was accomplished against three substantive headwinds changes in the opioid market continuing pricing pressure from payers and the challenges of growing the business and achieve with regular headwind distractions before i go further into our performance and plans let me highlight two additional areas that stood out in  our ip progress and our balance sheet depomed has a long history of excelling in legal matters in  further bolstered that regulation as you all know in september the company won district court decisions finding both of our nucynta composition of matter patents valid and in french by the nucynta antifilers we now expect our market exclusivity to extent to december  also in the patent front we received a favorable appeals court decision in march confirming the patient ability of the depomed patents asserted in our patent infringement lawsuit against purdue pharma related to their views to turn oxycontin our suite against purdue has resumed and we now expect the jury trial during the second half of  from the balance sheet side we did what we said we would do we prepaid  million of our secured debt facility held by deerfield and pharmakon dropping our secured debt to  million as we just reported we finished  with  million in cash later augi will discuss our plans to further pay down the debt in april and then to refinance the remaining balance at what we expect will be much more favorable terms this was our plan from the time that we took out the  loan to buy nucynta pay down the debt as quickly as possible and to refinance at the two year mark when the company’s credit characteristic would be significantly better and we did this in a nondiluted way to preserve shareholder value now i’ll turn back to our commercial and financial performance for last year starting with nucynta er in  we achieved all time record prescription volumes for the brand and grew prescriptions  over the prior year and that was against the challenging and changing backlog in the opioid market in  the long acting opioid market was stable compared to the prior year after the release of the new cdc opioid guidelines in early  the market moved suddenly downward with the long acting opioid prescription market ending the year down  compared to  we saw daily dosing levels drop as well both of these market trends were different than we had anticipated at the beginning of  even with these headwinds we still saw a significant growth in nucynta er the short acting opioid market acted much the same way with prescriptions down  in  nucynta immediate release outperformed the market for the first time in five years with prescriptions in  basically holding study compared to  considering that they nucynta ir had seen doubledigit decline for four straight years we are pleased with the progress and now look forward to moving the brand to growth in  in short the new challenges in the marketplace meant that we did not achieve the levels of growth that we had initially expected to see in  get nucynta er outperform the market by  and nucynta ir with  about the market as i mentioned earlier each of our brands recorded net sales achievements the highest in their history with gralise up  cambia up  zipsor up  and lazanda up  compare to full year  we see this as good indicators of growth and we are committed to finding ways to generate even more value in the future we’ve learned a lot since the relaunch of nucynta in june of  several things have changed in the opioid market including prescribing trends with some doctors stepping back from the category changes in dosing levels and reimbursement dynamic these insides along with nine years of exclusivity for tapentadol allow us to constantly move forward with our  nucynta and portfolio growth initiatives there are three prongs in our plan sales force deployment including revisions to our targeting our physicians product messaging initiatives both for nucynta er and immediate release and label enhancement studies to further differentiate our products during the second half of  we engaged the top three consulting firms to asses our commercial effectiveness and to identify opportunities for growth we then worked with zs associates the industry leader specializing in sales force sizing analysis and targeting analytics to complete a bottom up look at who we are calling on our sale structure and our deployments the new targeting and sales force alignment reflect the insights gains surrounding the recent changes in opioid prescribing as well as reimbursement dynamics specifically the new deployment provides us with more effective sales call allocation broader reach into high prescribing segments while also zeroing in on prescribers with favorable payer dynamics for depomed products for example we only kind of prescriptions sort of prescriber’s potential if nucynta or nucynta er has tier iii or better coverage with the payer for some doctor this targeting makes a dramatic difference in how we view them while they may have the potential to write the category they may not have a clear path to write our brands our efforts are focused on the writers with the best opportunity to prescribe our products for appropriate patients and to increase the odds that those prescriptions are paid and filled with the relaunch of nucynta in june  we first focused on nucynta er with pain specialist in the key opinion leader community with last year’s publication of the cdc guidelines as well as other sector pressures this decision prove to be the right one as we’ve seen more primary care physicians referring their pain patients to pain specialist who along with their nurse partitions and physicians assistance are seeing more patients than ever it’s important to note that not all primary care physicians have dropped off writing the category and this new targeting initiative is aimed at those who continue to prescribe in our markets the new targeting leads to changes in our sales force deployment and structure we’ve redrawn territory lines closed some territories and changed the layout of the sales force as a reminder our organization is comprised with three groups pain neurology and our oncology group that sells lazanda our pain team has increased to approximately  reps from  the team is now selling nucynta er nucynta immediate release and gralise which was formally sold under our neuro group for nucynta er and nucynta immediate release this increases the number of sales calls by about  compared to  and enables us to go deeper into high decile targets for shortacting opioids we returned gralise to the new and larger pain team as there is a large overlap between nucynta er prescribers and gralise and we were not seeing the results that we wanted to have from gralise with our smaller neuro group i can tell you that the pain team is excited to have gralise back as many of them helped launch the drug and they have great relationships with these prescribers we believe that gralise will benefit from this adjustment our neurology team now numbers  is responsible for cambia nucynta immediate release and zipsor and finally our oncology team was adjusted from  to  sales reps and will continue to focus on lazanda here are the net changes for this action we expect to seek continued and slightly expanded coverage of pain specialists significantly broaden coverage with high decile primary care prescribers of opioids and prioritize targets based on payer mix of each prescriber and their patient’s access to our brands we regained broader reach for gralise with presenters ph who know the product well have a team focused on headache specialists and neurologists who right migraine products and basically maintain our coverage with the current prescribers of lazanda in the turp category and all this was accomplished by adding only five sales territories during the messaging for nucynta er we are emphasizing it that first that is the first and only long acting opioid approved for the severe pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy or dpm market research shows that when dpm is the key part of the message physicians connect this with neuropathic conditions and mix pain and recognize nucynta er as the top choice we believe that by leading with dpm we will further drive differentiation resulting in prescription growth for nucynta immediate release we are launching a separate promotional campaign aimed at differentiating the product this is the first time since  that nucynta immediate release will have its own messaging campaign we believe that this support combined with the increased pain specialist and enhanced targeting we’ll move nucynta immediate release to volume growth our sale force is energized by these initiatives and are ready to make  a highly successful year finally with clarity on the nucynta patent exclusivity that provides us with another nine years to invest in it and we have the opportunity to grow the molecule well into that period we are taking steps in  to strengthen the scientific data for tapentadol this year we are initiating label enhancement studies aimed at further differentiating nucynta by highlighting its respiratory depression and have of used potential profile these labeling studies will focus on the properties of the tapentadol molecule and its uniqueness in the pain marketplace with this new  development focus and the longer exclusivity for nucynta we’re adjusting our timelines with the clinical development for cebranopadol our phase  ready asset and nucynta follow on candidate our plan is now to initiate phase  trials for cebranopadol in  we are comfortable with adjusting these timelines believing that we have time to complete the cebranopadol program and bring it to market well prior to the december  nucynta patent expiry and with that i will turn the call over to augie to review our financial results august moretti thank you jim today ill first review a few of the financial highlights from our fourth quarter followed by our  guidance i want to mention at the offset that with respect to our fourth quarter and full year results and our  guidance i will be discussing certain gaap measurements as well as certain nongaap measurements which we expect to continue to present in future periods please refer to todays press release for an explanation of our nongaap financial measures and tables that reconcile the companys nongaap measures to gaap measures also i want to mention that in our earnings release we changed our methodology for presenting adjusted nongaap earnings and accordance with fdc guidance issued in  and our press release has a reconciliation of our prior methodology and the new methodology that we will use going forward as jim just outlined the fourth quarter was a good one both in terms of product revenue and cash flow total product revenue for the quarter ended december   was a record  million representing yearoveryear product revenue growth of  for the fourth quarter total nucynta sales were record  million nucynta er achieved record prescription volume in q of over  and record all time quarterly market share nucynta er prescriptions for the year exceeded  in q the nucynta franchise represented approximately  of our product revenue the rest of our products also delivered strong performances in the fourth quarter gralise fourth quarter net sales were a record  million an increase of  compared to the fourth quarter of  full year net sales were  million cambia which we acquired in december  and relaunched in february  had fourth quarter net sales of  million full year net sales were  million lazanda which we acquired in late july  and relaunched in october  had fourth quarter net sales of  million an increase of  compared to fourth quarter  full year net sales were  million an increase of  compared to  zipsor full year net sales were  million an increase of  compared to  gains on hand at wholesalers increased approximately four to five days from the end of q to the end of q ending the year of approximately four weeks this is a typical pattern that we have seen in each of the last five years and reflects year end buying patterns from the large wholesalers based on our past experience we expect that days on hand at wholesalers will be reduced in q  and accordingly shipments of our products could be less than prescription demand in q q has historically been our weakest quarter of the year due to reduction in days on hand in the channel and annual insurance resets and we expect product revenues in q  to be less than q of  as has been our pattern for last several years couple of comments on cost of goods cost of goods for our portfolio in q  was approximately  and cogs for the full year was approximately  as most of you on the call know cogs for nucynta is approximately  of net sales and cogs for the rest of the portfolio is approximately  turning to our expenses gaap selling general and administrative expenses were  million for the fourth quarter of  these expenses include  million associated with the companys activities and settlement with the starboard value excluding stockbased compensation contingent consideration and the onetime expenses associated with the starboard nongaap sga expense was  million for the fourth quarter of  gaap sga expense for the full year was  million nongaap sga expense for the full year was  million gaap and nongaap research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of  were  million and  million respectively gaap and nongaap research and development expenses for the full year  million and  million respectively rd expense includes costs associated with the pediatric trials of nucynta and cost associated with cebranopadol development as discussed in our press release we are modifying our method of calculating nongaap income tax expense for nongaap adjusted earnings and nongaap adjusted earnings per share to align with the guidance under the nongaap financial measures compliance and disclosure interpretations issued by the sec on may   this new methodology which the company will use exclusively beginning in the first quarter of  calculates nongaap tax expense by adjusting the gaap tax expense for the estimated tax impact of each nongaap adjustments the estimated tax impact is based on the statutory income tax rate for each nongaap adjustment previously we adjusted the nongaap tax expense to reflect the estimate amount we expected to pay or received in taxes for the period we present nongaap adjusted earnings and nongaap adjusted earnings per share under both our old and new methodology and provide reconciliations in our press release for comparisons to our guidance which used our prior methodology our nongaap adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter using our prior methodology were  million from  per share and for the full year were  million or  per share the change in methodology has no effect on nongaap adjusted ebitda by the way we expect our cash tax rate for  to be in the midteens as of december   cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million which represent a quarterly increase of  million this increase included approximately  million of income tax refund during  we used cash to prepay  million of our secured indebtedness and a  million prepayment fee as we have stated several times over the last few months we intent to use at least  million of our cash to prepay our security indebtedness in early april of this year and we intend to refinance the balance of indebtedness we are investigating several different approaches to refinancing the debt we expect that the refinancing will result in a reduced interest rate on our outstanding debt and the combination of repayment and refinancing at a lower rate will substantially reduce our interest expense going forward however for your models i want to remind analysts and investors that as a result of the expected repayment and refinancing we will incur a prepayment fee of  million and we will writeoff approximately  million of noncash expense consisting of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs we will recognize these expenses in q refinancing at a lower interest rate will in large measure depend upon our recent and projected ebitda ebitda for  was  million in april of this year after repayment of at least  million of principal our secured debt to ebitda ratio using our  ebitda should be approximately  and using our expected ebitda as set forth in our  guidance which we will discuss in a moment should the under  one final item before we get to guidance the company recorded a  million gaap valuation allowance to offset in full the future tax benefit related to its net differed tax assets as of december   this was done because realization of the tax benefit of these differed assets as determined by gaap is uncertain the applicable gaap standard does not allow us to rely on internal projections of taxable future income the company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis using the criteria described in the applicable accounting literature and to assess whether an additional reserve or a release of the valuation allowance is required in future periods this change in the fourth quarter has no effect on the company’s cash flows or nongaap financial measures now turning to  guidance guidance for the year is based on our current budget and our budget is based on a large number of assumptions there are significant uncertainties in estimating future product revenues and operating expenses this is particularly true on the revenue side for our largest revenue products nucynta and nucynta er and on the expense side for the rd expenses related to our ongoing pediatric studies nucynta label studies that jim mentioned and several development works for a more complete discussion of the relevant risks relating to our guidance i will direct you to the risk factors section of our annual report on form k that we expect to file later this week with that said total  revenues are expected to be  million to  million we expect total product revenues to be approximately the same as we are not anticipating any milestone revenue or any significant royalty revenue in  cost of goods for our products in  will be approximately  of net sales for nucynta and nucynta er cogs will be approximately  reflecting manufacturing cost and the royalties on net sales indiscernible average cogs on the other products are expected to be approximately  of net sales nongaap sga expense that is gaap minus stock compensation and contingent consideration for  is expected to be  million to  million as in past years sga expenses will be slightly frontend loaded during the year nongaap rd expense that is gaap minus stock compensation is expected to be  million to  million these expenses include nucynta label studies that jim mentioned several development program as well as pediatric studies for nucynta we expect rd expense to be somewhat backend loaded during the year interest expense for the year was expecting to be  million to  million as we discussed a few moments ago we expect to prepay at least  million of our existing secured debt in april  in additionally plan to refinance the remaining unpaid balance of our existing secured debt this will incur a prepayment fee of  million and we will writeoff approximately  million of noncash expense consisting of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs we will recognize these expenses in q and this total of  million is included in the interest expense actual interest expense with depend upon the rates we achieve in the refinancing adjusted ebitda for  is expected to be  million to  million and finally before i turn the call back over to jim just a final comment on gaap financial measures nongaap financial measures used by depomed are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and maybe calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to nongaap measures used by other companies that concludes the financial discussion i’ll now turn the call back over to jim james schoeneck thanks augie over the past four years we’ve gone from the company virtually unknown wire physician customers to one of the top companies in our field we believe that we have performed well in the phase of the  challenges and we believe that have strategies in place to take us to the next level we think that this will benefit the patients the providers and the payers that we serve and will deliver additional value to shareholders and with that ill open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of randall stanicky with rbc capital markets caller your line is open randall stanicky great thank you hi guys i just have a couple of questions if you are looking at the guidance for  it implies about  million of revenue increase which is about  and then when i look at recent nucynta scripts they seem to have slightly moderated in recent weeks and so can you just maybe talk about that and help us calibrate the price volume build into those guidance numbers and then i have a followup james schoeneck so randall just in general we expect to see nucynta er scripts up in doubledigit and nucynta ir scripts getting into singledigit growth and so thats what we are in the volume side in addition to seeing some realization of the price increases that we’ve taken that we took last year at this point as you know we have not taken a price increase in  as far as the recent trends around it i think we have been and would expect to go through in this first quarter through some level of disruption as we’ve moved things around in the sales force and we’ve added  people approximately to our pain sales force which is the group that will really push and move nucynta and nucynta er and in that group but we’ve got a number of positional relationships that are now new because of the changes that weve made and we have some places in the country where were actually hiring new people so wed expect as you would see in these situations some level of disruptions with the first three to four months after this redeployment has taken place and then we would expect to see both the growth coming in and then the benefit of that redeployment happening in the second half of the year randall stanicky okay so we should expect scripts to be flattish for the first quarter too and then start to pick up in the back half for nucynta thats where you would think… james schoeneck i would say yes softer in the first part of the year and then increasing towards the back half of the year randall stanicky okay great and then i have a bigger picture question for you youve grown the ebitda base youve improved your balance sheet and you probably have quite a bit of opportunity to leverage the broader infrastructure and youre still independent company so as you look at depomed today whats the opportunity for depomed to go out and pursue the deal on its own and where strategically do you think that would be most beneficial and how much capacity do you have james schoeneck so i’ll answer the first couple of piece and ill let augi jump in on the capacity piece one i think we have a firm conviction both as management and a board that to be able to succeed in the marketplace that were in the pharmaceutical marketplace youve got to get bigger and thats a both scale for working with managed care plans its scale for be able to have part of your revenue base going toward development to then fund innovation to be able to both grow markets and to be able to get paid for that in the future and so with that we continue to have a very watchful eye toward opportunities to bring things in or to look for things that might get us much bigger much faster now with all that said are the areas that were looking at really have not fundamentally changed where we look at the central nerve system as a great opportunity with a number of submarkets in there weve been in the pain market but certainly are and have been open to doing things in the broader neuro market or even into parts like the psych market weve defined in the past adjacencies things like addiction therapy or things where we already call on orthopods and rheumatologists that we would have infrastructure that are already to be able to move forward and if we saw the right opportunity for something that was maybe a bit less adjacent and thought it could be a great standalone business we would look at that as well assuming that it brought us significant scale so we tend to be  we continue to be open on those fronts in terms of how we get to scale whether its us being able to execute transactions to bring things in more of a merger of equals or something where we would become part of something larger because we believe that firmly and scale as a necessarily piece of success randall stanicky okay and then… august moretti and with respect to your question about capacity keep in mind that i think what the total capacity would be within large measure be dependent upon the cash flow characteristics of the target that we would go after but if i just think about our own balance sheet for a moment as i mentioned in my remarks if we use our midpoint of our ebitda guidance for  our secured debttoebitda ratio will be approximately  when were done with the repayment refinancing i think we could to operate at four times so essentially borrowing again as much debt as we had outstanding and then i think again layering on top of that what support we could get from the cash flow associated with the target we were after randall stanicky okay and augi is equity an option for you august moretti i think would very depend upon the deal i certainly wouldnt say that its off the table randall stanicky okay great thanks guys james schoeneck thanks randall operator and your next question comes from the line of jason gerberry with leerink partners caller your line is open jason gerberry hey good evening thanks for taking my questions just a couple of follow ups on the guide if you can comment i wasnt sure if nucynta pricing was actually factored in  new price increases taken in  factored in the guidance i know that you guys have kind of been more of a price follower so just wanted to clarify if pricing in  will be upside to numbers james schoeneck so jason weve definitely  i think last year we took one price increase this year i would anticipate that we would take price at some point during the year but as you know as with the rest of the industry we don’t pre announce that but i would expect that we wouldn’t take price during the course of the year we did see a couple of people in our  in the opioid marketplace take price increases in january of about  so to your point we do watch closely where other players in the market are particularly the market leaders and look to stay within a band around that price jason gerberry got it and it look like the mix of nucynta er to ir has somewhat stabilize would it be your operating assumption that the mix of er to ir is pretty stable going forward james schoeneck we still see er growing quicker as i mentioned before where i would see the growth there in doubledigits where ir as you know has been  we were finally able to hold the decline that we inherited when we launched the product and now in  with the additional focus both in terms of the messaging and in terms of the sales force and targeting we would expect to bring that into growth but let’s take the first step first which is getting it into singledigit growth jason gerberry got it and then last one for me just thinking about the  forecasted growth for ‘ is it fair to think about the two big products nucynta release sort of being above that bandwidth and then the remainder of the portfolio falling below or can you just kind of give us some directional parameters on the product mix james schoeneck yes we haven’t done that in the past and i think we are ready to start doing it jason i understand the question but at this point the guidance is nonproduct specific jason gerberry got it okay thanks for taking the questions james schoeneck thanks jason operator and your next question comes from the line of ami fadia caller your line is open ami fadia hi thanks for the question couple of questions firstly just with respect to nucynta could you go back and tell us which price increases in the past you haven’t yet seen an impact on your net price i believe there was a price increase in third quarter of ‘ and there was a still a small portion of the original like  plus percent price increase you’ve taken when you required it how much of it is yet to flow through to your net price that’s one piece and then in your guidance for  can you give us some color on the market growth that you have baked into your assumption and i wanted you to clarify if you’ve baked in another price increase into your guidance or not and then i have a few others questions james schoeneck okay let’s take the first i’ll let augie come back on the net price from the past increases but in terms of the market growth we have watched as you have the market trends and we don’t see a large scale change from that in  from what we saw in  at least as it comes to the opioid markets and so we are forecasting contraction of both of those markets and with that an increase in share for our products providing the growth in terms of pricing as i mentioned we have not  we have taken price increases this year on cambia and lazanda we have not on the rest of the portfolio and i would  and as i said i would expect that we will take price at some point during the year on nucynta and gralise as well as zipsor ami fadia got it maybe if augie you could address the price increase from the previous quarters august moretti sure so as we said on our last quarterly call price increase that we took we did not see any benefit of price increase in q what we had indicated was we were expecting to see approximately  of the price increase in q and then approximately  more of that price increase as we moved into q of this year and that’s been the experience that we’ve had ami fadia i see okay i didn’t see any benefit but we can talk offline more about that maybe a related question just on your sales force reallocation all the markets that you guys operate in are very detail sensitive markets and as you pull sales force focus from some of your products and put it towards nucynta do you worry about some of the other smaller products suffering from that how do you think about that thank you james schoeneck i would say lazanda is a very distinct market as you know and making the change that we made on lazanda we moved from covering  of the prescriptions and a little bit less of that at the market to  so even with the  people we have we cover greater than  of our own product coverage around that product so not a big effect at all in terms of cambia that becomes a more focused group instead of selling gralise and cambia and their lead will be cambia so actually the sales call equivalence for cambia actually go up zipsor does come down in this configuration but as you know thats been a smaller product for us and really one thats more sample sensitive than it is detailed sensitive and the two big beneficiaries of it in particular are nucynta er and even more so nucynta immediate release and as were in the market that were in we believe that with the differentiation we have around tapentadol on the unique molecule and with the length of the time that we have on the ip for it that thats the best place to put the resource and really drive the growth and so hence thats the decision that we’ve made to be able to focus that way ami fadia got it thank you james schoeneck thanks ami operator and your next question comes from the line of david amsellem with piper jaffray caller your line is open david amsellem thanks so in the past you have talked about focusing more on the fact that nucynta has a differentiated label in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy used as a selling point and i think what you said is that you think that will be a key driver of potentially an uptick in volume growth but i guess the question here is what specifically do you think youre going to do differently going forward given that since you have the product in  youve been talking to that point of differentiation so i guess what im trying to understand is what do you think you can do differently or what specifically are you doing differently here with throughout nucynta james schoeneck yes david on the relaunch of nucynta er we focused on chronic lower back pain there was a couple of pages in the sales aid that had data on dpm but it wasnt a key focus and it wasn’t anything that was a lead which is what weve changed to starting in the beginning of february the data thats there weve got additional recurring carriers weve got patient profiles that really highlight that because we see as such was the differentiation but it was crucial for us the beginning to reestablish ourselves with the pain specialist and that to do that really chronic lower back pain really is the key in those practices so we feel like weve done a good job of laying that base and now its time to switch the focus and well actually be leading with the dpm piece in a much more detail with its own if you want to call it subsupport program within the broader campaigns which has never had either under jj’s hands where they actually didnt launch it because they stopped promotions shortly after it was approved or in ours where it was a couple of pages towards the back of a sales aid david amsellem okay and then secondly on gralise it’s felt like to me that in the broader neuropathic pain space its a pretty small volume player but nonetheless indiscernible has gone generic in the not too distant future so maybe talk about longer term how you think that may or may not impact gralise volumes thanks james schoeneck david thanks thats already the market that gralise is in and with gralise having as the chemical entity gaba ph a patent it’s already an  generic market and in fact that  is made up of generic gaba so were used to be in a marketplace that has heavy generic on that versus having being a primarily branded market because thats really what were doing is really separating gralise from the generic gaba thats prescribed so broadly in the marketplace so while that certainly will be an event in the marketplace i mean its possible that you could have some plans to some sort of a double step at it or something to gralise we dont see it being a big impact and it’s one as i said weve already been used to playing in a market like that thats heavily generic david amsellem okay thank you james schoeneck thanks david operator and your next question comes from the line of david risinger with morgan stanley caller your line is open david risinger thanks very much hi jim and augie i have just two questions and i apologize i had to step out the call briefly so if i am repeating anything you can skip it but cebranopadol could you please comment on how much you think the phase  program will costs and maybe give us a sense for annual spending for phase  so we know what the outlook might be for spending once you do start phase  and then with respect to be strategic agenda i know jim you’ve discussed in the past that better scale and leverage would be beneficial to the company so you’re considering different options for that if you could just update us and provide any additional comments on your strategic outlook that would be great thanks so much james schoeneck okay on the first and i’ll let augie comment more specifically around some of the cost pieces but on cebra we did mentioned that with decisions that we’ve made to invest in enhancing the label on nucynta that we’re moving the start of the cebra program back to  for the phase  program and i’ll let augie comment perhaps on that and then i’ll come back on the strategic agenda august moretti right so the phase  development expenses will be spread across ‘ ‘ and ‘ we are still in the process of negotiating the phase  clinical trial agreements and i don’t have a detailed update on development expense at this time david but the expenses will really be incur in ‘ ‘ and ‘ james schoeneck and then on the strategic agenda i had mentioned earlier that we do  we are committed to scale and that is getting bigger either by us acquiring merger of equals or being part of something bigger because we believe it’s crucial both for the managed care environment that we are in the payer environment and also to be able to put an appropriate amount of investment toward development to be able to bring innovation to the market and ultimately that being the key to getting paid particularly as we going forward so with that we are open to all those fronts because we are really committed scale david risinger thanks so much operator and your next question comes from the line of scott henry with roth capital caller your line is open scott henry thank you and good afternoon gentlemen i’m going to start just on a big picture question i know you hit on it a little bit about expecting contraction in the opioid market now obviously pain is not going away and paid treatments are not going way so at what point would you expect the opioid market to bottom out obviously you don’t have a crystal ball but i just like to get your thoughts i mean do you think by the end of  you start to at least be flat or how should we think about the duration of this kind of contraction cycle james schoeneck i actually see it as a bit longer term than just ‘ ‘ i think it will start to mitigate but i think it’s going to be a few years before you see it actually get to flat and some of that as i think some of it is bringing some things out of the system that probably shouldn’t have been there to start with and i think you’ve got pressure that have people that have over prescribed we think thats appropriate and so i think this is where doing the work that we are starting the first half of this year to further differentiate the molecule we think is really the key for us because over the next few years it’s going to be an appropriate use and share situation and thats the way we are focused on it scott henry so i guess and that kind of leads into the followup question i don’t expect nucynta was high on the abuser list and it certainly does fit the profile of an opioid one would abuse but the negatives of the market have outweighed that profile over the past year at what point do you think the nucynta profile flips over in terms of that negative into a positive by differentiating it is that something you could hope to be have in place by the coming out of ‘ and to  james schoeneck and so when i think the market of course we do market research you see that the perception of nucynta is different than the other pure new opioids you also certainly see differences in the street price and some other things that we’ve talked about before and we see that the brands are actually outperforming the market so nucynta immediate release scripts were flat for the year versus the market that was down  nucynta er was up  against the market that was down  so we continue to see the brand but what we are doing on these studies that i mentioned is really to enhance that profile to get the data there and be able to get it hopefully into the label now knowing the timeframes for that which includes both doing the clinical work and producing the scientific data and then filing it with the agency i think the effect of those things the practical effect beyond say publication of some data is more in a  timeframe than a  scott henry okay and then final question which is a little more specific in the past couple of years certainly at the end of ‘ and at the end of  your january market share for nucynta has taken a noticeable decline but then in february you recoup that claim and by march you are hitting new highs in market share now obviously one or two data points don’t make a trend but when you look into ‘ the question is would you expect market share to snap back in february and then again be reaching new highs within the first half of the year do you think that’s just a dynamic trend because of january the reset of the copays of whatever it maybe james schoeneck yes i think in general that’s true this year we have the added piece which is the retooling of the sales group and so we’ve got a lot of our physician customers that have got a different sales coverage coming in just by definition growing from about  people to  we’ve got a lot more physicians will be calling on that will be new to us so i actually would see that taking a bit longer this year than we have seen it in past years just because of that disruption factor in terms of our sales coverage scott henry okay thanks for the color final question for augie i just wanted to make sure i understood the change and i have seen this with a couple of companies now the way of computing tax for nongaap i mean effectively should we start thinking about your nongaap being fully taxed versus i assume in the prior it was a truncated rate i mean is that what’s going on so when i think of comparing prior estimate to a new estimate i guess it’s a higher bar now august moretti that is essentially what’s taking place we are tax affecting each item at the statutory tax rate as oppose to our prior methodology which really applied our cash tax rate which was substantially lower than the statutory rate so scott henry i mean what sort of range august moretti so if you look at the reconciliations in the press release scott i mean you can see the difference in the tax adjustments and they are significant james schoeneck yes for  for example as augie mentioned before we expect an effective cash tax rate in the midteens and yet what you see from fully allocating is going to be significantly higher than that so it’s a noncash impact on the earnings but indeed its fair based on the sec guidance for reporting scott henry okay great thanks for taking the questions guys james schoeneck thanks scott operator and you next question comes from the line of ken trbovich with janney caller your line is open ken trbovich thanks couple of quick question augie i think earlier in the discussion you had said something about cogs for nucynta did i misunderstand you is the cogs for nucynta coming down in  august moretti would be approximately the same its composed of two items one is the manufacturing transfer costs and the second is the royalty on net sales that we pay to indiscernible so it’s been  approximately for the two products for nucynta as a franchise and that it will approximately that going forward in  james schoeneck although i would expect it to drop a little bit in the second half of the year because there is a small royalty that’s paid to a party not indiscernible and that actually stops in may ken trbovich okay but there was a comment i think during the initial discussion there was some referenced to  i was uncertain what that was pertaining to august moretti  was the cogs across the blended cogs if you will across the portfolio ken trbovich got it the whole portfolio i miss understood that okay okay i appreciate that and then augie just on the debt and the refinance i know you’ve got some specific targets on where you think you’re going to be in terms of secured debttoebitda do you have a sense yet from the rating the agencies as to sort of where that would put you is that maybe going to put you in that b b kind of category and could you give us feel for what you think the borrowing costs for those types of ratings might be in the market today august moretti ken im reluctant to speculate on what the actual borrowing costs is obviously there is a lot of dynamisms in the debt market today and we wont really price anything until we get out to april james schoeneck but i think ken it is important that as were looking at this we are looking at more than just bonds and so augie why don’t you just mention the august moretti so weve looked at a whole range of possibilities and they fall onto sort of three buckets one is referred to as a term loan a which is really syndicated bank debt and that bank debt that does not require a rating then there is something referred to as term loan b which is debt that is really syndicated to institutional investors that does require a rating and then third large bucket is high yield debt which absolutely requires a rating and then so were looking across a whole range but there is at least one set of alternatives in the syndicated bank loan area that would not require us to get a rating ken trbovich okay james schoeneck and really what we look at is that tradeoff between rates covenants and flexibility ken trbovich sure and i know you guys gave some guidance as to what you expect the interest expense to be including the charges that you referenced for the second quarter does that factor in the lower borrowing cost or is that sort of steady state for the current borrowing at the current terms august moretti couple of things in terms of the expense that weve just talked about in terms of the guidance section that that assumes what we consider to be a relatively conservative assumption on refinancing rate hopefully we will be able to do better than that but wont know until we get out to april ken trbovich okay thank you august moretti thank you ken operator and your last question comes from the line of chiara russo with cantor fitzgerald caller your line is open chiara russo yes hey guys i think ill be quick here ive only two questions as most of my have been asked and answered the first is easy you talk about contraction within the states that looking to expand the market share i was wondering if you could sort of  if there was any framework around end or exit from promoting their products and how you sort of look at that market share or taking some of that market share james schoeneck yes so chiara we definitely see that as an opportunity and there is really two really pieces to it one is looking at it in terms of just a player that had a large share of voice a large of people selling in the space between the end or dedicated people that were their employees and their contract sales force there is about  people that were selling in this space that no longer are so that certainly helps us in terms of the share of voice in the marketplace and gives us an opportunity to pick up the share that was there with opona ph so we certainly do look at that as an specific opportunity and those are scripts that were the physicians already to choosing to use something other than either an oxycodone based product or morphine based product so one that we think maybe some valuable ones for us to go after and in addition there is some very good people and the fact that we at this point we have territories that were open weve had i can say a lot of people from the indo side and because of the data that we have we know how they perform and so weve been able to cross reference that and really go where to do have openings and where do we have experience people in the pain space that could be a good match for us chiara russo fair enough okay and so my last question has to do with these label extension studies i think you said that youre going to be focusing respiratory depression and abuse and i was curious if you could give us a little bit more detail into what those studies would look like and what the additional label would look like as well james schoeneck yes and so its really two sets of studies one would be to do i would call the kind of traditional or per guidance category one two and three studies that others have done that really is more around abuse to turn it and that are really intended more for molecules that are already significantly abused and then you are using a physical or chemical barrier around it to try and force that abuse so we with one set of studies that we follow that but i think the ones that are more interesting are the ones that would look to separate data that we could produce around respiratory depression look at what is the respiratory depression for tapentadol is there a sealing effect what is really the impact there because that’s what people die from with that take opioid that’s really is the concern around that and we have data that’s been published over the last year or like a k series of  consecutive pediatric accidental overdoses with tapentadol i think the most remarkable part of that is none of the children died if that had been a oxycodone based products you will could have seen  or  of them that would have perished in that kind of a situation so we see things like that and those things are more anecdotal and are not available for use by our sales force now with that said producing data that can be included in the label generally in the pharmacology section of the label and then could be promoted would not be comparative to the other products but would be data that they would not have and so our reps could not make a direct comparison and say something is better or lower or something like that but yes they would be able to describe the results of those studies assuming that we were able to get it into the label chiara russo got you and the timeline for that i think you said it was about  james schoeneck yes we started now we get data in ‘ and then you have got filing with the agency that i think for practical pieces that you can’t get into the label to be able to promote until  chiara russo okay alright great thank you james schoeneck sure thanks operator and we have no further questions in queue jim the floor is yours james schoeneck thank you i just want to say in closing i want to thank all of you that follow the company and in particular though i want to thank the remarkable team here at the company that stay focused on our mission and our vision during what that have been some challenging times and headlines in  we think we’ve put together a highly differentiated portfolio one that helped us become a top three player in the pain space and really than with the ability to grow well beyond that we look forward to that we look forward to updating you on our key milestones as we go through the year we continue to look for ways to enhance the growth and bring value to our business and again thank you for your support operator and this concludes today’s conference call you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on this site

employees and focused primarily on developing an esignature platform for real estate transactions but krach the cofounder of ariba network and rasba corp quickly recognized the opportunities were much greater than this single vertical market he evaluated the existing leadership structure and instilled a new sense of direction focused on three major areas — talent vision and mission first he built a highperforming team this included assuming the additional role of ceo today krach spends about  percent of his time focused on talent acquisition and fostering a culture of teamwork and accountability krach also understood that part of that included fostering a culture where giving back to the community was important next he created a clear vision to communicate to employees the future of the company to transform the business world in how transactions are managed finally krach created a new mission for docusign that was much broader than its initial focus develop and enable a platform where any confidential documents — not just real estate transactions — could be signed and transacted securely at any time on any device he believed this could change the status quo of business transactions through a signature on a sheet of paper convincing the public to adapt docusign’s solution was the biggest challenge krach faced but when he partnered with salesforcecom to use docusign to transact test deals the leadership team at salesforce was so impressed that they invested financially and integrated the solution across its client base that move provided the spark krach needed to reach a mass market and today docusign serves more than  enterprise clients worldwide and more than  million individual users ● back to top  cloud services finalist         dylan smith cofounder and

wellestablished identity management vendors he discovered those vendors could not deliver solutions designed for cloud and mobile technologies so he built a cloudbased service that addressed these concerns the former head of engineering at salesforcecom witnessed the initial emergence of the cloud application market while overseeing the teams that focused on cloud applications he also saw the lack of existing competition and left his position at salesforce with a mockup and business plan to make his way in the market of cloud identity management a market that at the time didn’t exist analysts and market experts told mckinnon the venture was foolish but he had the foresight to see that he could take what was traditionally onsite infrastructure and identity management and offer it as a service as if it were a business application competition began to arise which was hugely positive as it legitimized his vision of cloudbased identity management okta could now move away from a focus on proving its value towards maximizing its potential as ceo mckinnon focused first on providing an endtoend solution that has coverage over any service a customer wants to deploy and manage on its platform he then worked to provide the highest number and most indepth integrations which it achieved through its growing partner base of companies that include adobe servicenow and advent which

to becoming a commercial pharmaceutical business schoeneck set an aggressive fiveyear goal that represented a significant shift in strategy though not all board members supported the new direction initially schoeneck’s leadership and charisma sparked a fire in depomed employees the opportunities he could see in the company began to come to fruition he speaks with admiration and respect for the legal team depomed has developed and the unbelievably challenging trials faced by the sales and marketing leaders schoeneck measures success by more than just financial growth he pushes the company to meet strategic goals grow its expertise in the field and ensure longterm plans are in place instead of shortterm financial gain schoeneck’s leadership style is exemplified by a conversation he had with a sales consultant who was preparing to leave the company they talked philosophy and hashed out goals and the framework of a corporate culture that they wanted to see they also thought about components that would breed success and foster growth in the business in the end schoeneck convinced the man who ultimately become the vice president of sales to stay schoeneck thrives where others struggle to see the path when he arrived at depomed the company had only one product glumetza which brought in minimal royalty income a lot of companies in a similar situation might buy a drug increase the price and then resell it for the shortterm benefit schoeneck demonstrated a different approach that can be tied back to the company’s belief in adding value to the health care marketplace

by retailers which limited growth potential foraker ceo recognized that if he could effectively change consumers’ attitudes and create a bond between them and the company he could pitch a new message to retailers and convince them to shift annie’s products to the main aisles his plan worked and over the next few years retailers started looking at annie’s differently they moved the company’s growing product line to the main aisles which sparked significant growth foraker’s efforts led to unexpected consequences because retailers suddenly saw organic food through a different lens the shift in product placement signaled the transition of organic foods from a niche product to a more mainstream consumer category — and annie’s was leading the way this attracted the attention of solera

had sold them didn’t work as promised at the time he was employed with a large public company as the head of sales and marketing krappe eventually quit his job and in  cofounded apttus with two likeminded people who believed that whatever a company sold better work and bring value to its customers as a longtime software industry veteran krappe understood the pros and cons of a new hightech startup he knew if they could focus on building and creating the right app — one that automated contract life cycle management — they could bypass some of the pitfalls by partnering with another company to host manage and deliver the product to consumers krappe ceo forged a deal with salesforcecom to build the company’s application solutions on its platform making apttus the first company to build exclusively this way this allowed krappe and his team to spend their time on development and testing without worrying about whether the delivery method or app management would fail once deployed krappe’s vision for this unique relationship gave apttus a builtin customer base that could seamlessly integrate its solutions into existing salesforce applications it also gave krappe the freedom to probe its thengrowing client base for ways to stretch extend and expand the initial product solutions as a result apttus essentially established the quotetocash and configurepricequoting category that existing salesforce customers use today apttus has become the top tool for automating and optimizing sales processes for organization that use salesforce and counts  members of the fortune  among its client roster and because of krappe’s customercentric model apttus has a  percent annual renewal rate for its solutions — among the highest in the industry ● back to top  technology award recipient       paul nahi president and ceo enphase energy wwwenphasecom paul nahi does not have his own office at enphase energy rather he and the rest of his management team sit in cubicles right alongside the company’s other employees nahi president and ceo strongly believes that not having individual offices promotes a culture where there are no boundaries between departments it allows for the crosspollination of ideas and a greater feeling of camaraderie across all levels and functions the philosophy is incorporated into every aspect of the design of the office from the location of the coffee machine to the completely transparent boardroom and meeting rooms for a ceo who believes that passion is one of the most important ingredients of his company’s success open communication is crucial the passion and empowerment has led to a young very successful business but it wasn’t always easy when nahi and enphase’s cofounders began to discuss their microinverters with the solar energy community they were told their idea was impossible and that they were going to fail nahi and the others disagreed and others were soon attempting to replicate enphase’s technology but they all failed to duplicate the company’s combination of technology and execution the industry enphase works in is dynamic and always changing — the future of solar power remains an unknown or as nahi describes it “opaque” to manage this risk he and his team are constantly analyzing the market and trends their current focus is solar but the larger strategy is inherent in the company’s name — enphase energy nahi would like to move beyond just solar power and become an energy innovator that will include technology in energy management and energy storage the key to making that happen will be maintaining a culture that encourages collaboration and an attitude that failure is ok if it ultimately leads to a better outcome ● back to top  technology finalist         conor madigan phd president and cofounder

televisions lighting panels printed circuit boards and thin film solar panels that are superthin bendable and unbreakable oled material however is sensitive to water solvent oxygen and moisture and may not survive the traditional process of printing in order to solve this problem the company built an ip portfolio around printing in a superpure environment of nitrogen as the company neared the time to commercialize its application madigan stepped down as ceo and brought in an external ceo with experience in capital equipment commercialization who could manage sales support and finance
