immunotherapy spotlight cyto  and the th annual mass cytometry summit sonia gavasso will be in boston in june for cyto®  with colleagues presenting posters on mass cytometry and flow cytometry “our poster will be on ms and natalizumab tysabri® a blocking antibody to alpha  integrin that the fda approved in  to treat relapsing ms” she will also attend the th annual mass cytometry summit the day before cyto “i’ve been to the mass cytometry summit several times and i will go this time as well absolutely it’s amazing to meet all these people with so much knowhow there” researcher sonia gavasso phd with the neuroimmunology lab at haukeland university hospital in bergen norway recently chatted with fluidigm about the role of mass cytometry in her team’s cancer research gavasso anticipates that mass cytometry or cytometry by timeofflight mass spectrometry the technology used in the cytof® system will help to align diagnostics with current biological understandings of cancer noting that monitoring therapies is key to making better decisions defining immunotherapy approaches there’s always talk about the importance of developing personalized therapies in the clinic but she believes there should also be personalized monitoring fueling her work at university of bergen through selfdescribed fascination and love of science gavasso explained “i have a passion for biology and an imagination for complexity when i moved to norway and joined the haukeland university hospital i began studying immunology and central nervous system diseases which are highly complex that’s where mass cytometry comes in” in the expert review of molecular diagnostics paper “singlecell proteomics potential implications for cancer diagnostics” gavasso et al issue an inspiring call for researchers to develop solutions addressing key problems in sustainable health care “we believe new and emerging technologies will allow us to move from mostly empirical decisions to tailored treatments enabling fast and early decisions regarding response” she said “it would be the holy grail even before treatment starts” in human medicine it’s difficult to predict who will respond to an immunotherapy the paper outlines an integral need for handson simple technology to monitor response over time rather than administering longterm treatment before differentiating between responders and nonresponders “mass cytometry has amazing potential i don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’ but it’s close to it this is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do” —sonia gavasso phd neuroimmunology lab haukeland university norway enter helios gavasso wanted to get a view of the immune system and how it behaves during therapy “one out of three people die from cancer and it’s increasing so something has to happen there’s a real need for singlecell analysis technologies that revolutionize what we can do in research to translate into clinical diagnostics and monitoring with cytof technology” she continued “we can go much deeper into whole system immunophenotyping to see where these medications actually work and where the antibody binds and has an effect this is a completely new holistic way to look at and monitor the immune system” when she heard about cytof technology in  gavasso remembered some were skeptical but she was thinking “‘we should absolutely do this’ i was fascinated and super excited about it” she visited scientists in paris who had a mass cytometer and recalled being amazed seeing it in action “in norway they like established procedures and technologies so we had to wait a long time but we didn’t give up” their helios™ was a gift to the haukeland university hospital and university in bergen funded through a bergen research foundation grant “we now have a helios system and it’s running really well we have our own dedicated mass cytometry team here to take care of the system and run mass cytometry at the hospital where we collect lots of cells in clinical trials” gavasso holds great hopes for mass cytometry citing around  major cryobanks collecting cell samples for mass cytometry applications in cancer rheumatic neurological and central nervous system diseases and advanced therapies like cryoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation “we plan to get another helios and we look forward to being able to expand our mass cytometry capabilities with tissue imaging” advantages over flow cytometry the visualization in mass cytometry data is a major plus for gavasso “with mass cytometry we’re finally getting a view of the elusive immune response in immune therapies disease systems are so complex it’s super that we can look at a certain cell but not lose information about what other cell types are doing or where they are within the immune system that is absolutely unbelievable” she said “previously this type of information was difficult to obtain in a single analysis with flow cytometry and mass cytometry clearly expands our horizon” she noted “so we can monitor complexity” her team reported debulking in leukemia during kinase inhibitor treatment as early as seven days after starting they also saw where a medicinal antibody binds and in which cell subtype “it is unprecedented we would not do this on the flow cytometer there are too many tubes that are difficult to combine and need lots of controls” gavasso gave the example of how medications come to the field after successful clinical trials but how they actually work is often unknown so researchers like her must rush to explain the mechanistic action for her mass cytometry is the technology to discover what immunemodulating compounds do in the immune system “i am a believer” she said “mass cytometry has amazing potential i don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’ but it’s close to it this is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do” her lab in bergen is currently running major helios projects for which they’re collecting tissue and cell samples for one study they’re using helios to monitor cryoimmunotherapy response in prostate cancer another involves developing stem cell transplant treatment approaches for ms and for leukemia using cytof technology to understand how the immune system reconstitutes after stem cell transplantation and immune ablation the team is also studying graft versus host disease in cancer “mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using it’s actually much much better” —sonia gavasso phd neuroimmunology lab haukeland university norway papers in the pipeline gavasso has a proofofprinciple chronic myeloid leukemia cml study of treatment with nilotinib tasigna® a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in press “we’d see clear changes three hours after initiating therapy and debulking after one week in this enest clinical trial substudy” the team has the opportunity to collect samples before therapy and again within hours of treatment because they work closely with treating physicians in their clinical trial units “in treatment” gavasso explained “those early tests provide valuable information so we don’t have to wait a whole year before we can label them responders or nonresponders” ultimately gavasso dreams of being able to analyze immune cells in the brain in nervous system diseases “it’s difficult to collect samples from within the central nervous system and if we do get them” she said “it would be really cool to have excellent technologies for analyzing samples at any level from rna to dna to proteomics” bioinformatics approach gavasso has several applications for working collaboratively with bioinformaticians to analyze biological programming algorithmic and statistical data from helios independent of what’s published her group works closely with lab mathematicians on topology studying spatial properties preserved through stretching crumpling bending and twisting of objects to verify methodological usability cytobank is a boon especially for studying the clinical dataset needed to integrate with information from the mass cytometer “cytof technology is better than how we did things before in the clinic when we had to always select cells and parameters this is really exciting” she added “mathematicians here in bergen actually come to us now asking for datasets” a new perspective mass cytometry for higherparameter analysis of precious samples offers a number of advantages “personally i was excited to let go of the twodimensional flow cytometry approach” she said “mass cytometry is amazing but some people find change difficult and are reluctant to go highdimension saying ‘we’ve been doing things this way forever it works so why change now’” gavasso’s answer “mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using it’s actually much much better” for research use only not for use in

combined with other t cell panels or to customize with individually selected markers of interest maximize data collected from limited oncology samples investigate t cell activity across all major subtypes at every stage of cancer treatment monitor checkpoint expression on t cells in response to treatment and correlate with outcome phenotype tumor infiltrates or other tissues in addition to blood the promising field of immunooncology presents many unanswered questions for scientists in biopharma cancer research flow and mass cytometry core facilities and immunology and immunooncology academic institutions how do cancer cells evade the immune system which cells and pathways are the best molecular targets what is the mechanism of action for potential pharmaceuticals how can we increase tumor immunogenicity which biomarkers could predict response which drugs offer the best treatment outcomes and in what order of use approaches based on immunotherapy are providing unprecedented benefits for cancer patients—most importantly durable responses and complete remission at rates that far surpass conventional chemotherapy the defining feature of immunotherapy is that t cells and other cell types in the immune system mediate the anticancer response but immune system cells also promote adverse reactions in some immunotherapy patients monitoring t cells and other immune cells in these patients is important for drug development understanding mechanisms of action and determining biomarkers that correlate with both response and adverse events “enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured using the unique power of mass cytometry the immunooncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care” —chris linthwaite president and ceo fluidigm the maxpar® human t cell immunooncology ex panel kit—together with the human t cell phenotyping panel kits—enables comprehensive identification of all major t cell subsets

complete coverage individual antibodies offer further customization for specific research needs with access to a growing catalog of more than  commercially available preconjugated antibodies and custom conjugation options the maxpar panel system can be adapted to meet changing needs in cancer immunotherapy research a new industry standard “the dynamic nature and inherent complexity of the antitumor immune response requires new approaches to deeply profile cell populations at singlecell resolution” said fluidigm president and ceo chris linthwaite “this new set of multiparameter panels will empower more researchers with highdimensional tools to interrogate the tumor immune response and the tumor microenvironment maximizing the information obtained from each precious sample” “enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured” linthwaite added “using the unique power of mass cytometry the immunooncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care” mass cytometry is fast becoming an industry standard for deep cellular profiling in translational and clinical research referenced by hundreds of peer reviewed publications mass cytometry expands beyond the inherent technical limitations of flow cytometry with minimal spectral overlap the technology enables researchers to interrogate more than  parameters simultaneously from millions of cells across both intracellular and extracellular protein markers sample case study as an example the journal of immunology published a paper by rituparna das et al “combination therapy with antictla and antipd leads to distinct immunologic changes in vivo” demonstrating highly multiplexed phenotyping of circulating immune cells to characterize immune response to individual and combination therapies the report detailed the team’s experimental approach in a patient cancer study at yale university and memorial sloan kettering cancer center das and her collaborators used mass cytometry to perform multiparameter immunophenotyping of human pbmcs from patients before and after they were administered antipd andor antictla checkpoint blockade therapy their customized marker panel included the marker maxpar human t cell phenotyping panel kit they reported that the population of ki cells increasing after antictla or combination checkpoint blockade had a phenotype of cdro ccr− cd cd and cd “consistent with transitional memory t cells” these same proliferating cells also upregulated mhc class ii hladr such deep profiling and identification of changes in this unique cell population would have been difficult using traditional approaches our new t cell immunooncology panel sets offer even deeper profiling than those used in the study cited above combining maxpar t cell and immunooncology panels creates an unprecedented tool for profiling t cells these panel sets also illustrate the power of mass cytometry as the premier platform for immune profiling and monitoring

the potential for mass cytometry to improve immunotherapy spotlight cyto  and the th annual mass cytometry summit sonia gavasso will be in boston in june for cyto®  with colleagues presenting posters on mass cytometry and flow cytometry “our poster will be on ms and natalizumab tysabri® a blocking antibody to alpha  integrin that the fda approved in  to treat relapsing ms” she will also attend the th annual mass cytometry summit the day before cyto “i’ve been to the mass cytometry summit several times and i will go this time as well absolutely it’s amazing to meet all these people with so much knowhow there” researcher sonia gavasso phd with the neuroimmunology lab at haukeland university hospital in bergen norway recently chatted with fluidigm about the role of mass cytometry in her team’s cancer research gavasso anticipates that mass cytometry or cytometry by timeofflight mass spectrometry the technology used in the cytof® system will help to align diagnostics with current biological understandings of cancer noting that monitoring therapies is key to making better decisions defining immunotherapy approaches there’s always talk about the importance of developing personalized therapies in the clinic but she believes there should also be personalized monitoring fueling her work at university of bergen through selfdescribed fascination and love of science gavasso explained “i have a passion for biology and an imagination for complexity when i moved to norway and joined the haukeland university hospital i began studying immunology and central nervous system diseases which are highly complex that’s where mass cytometry comes in” in the expert review of molecular diagnostics paper “singlecell proteomics potential implications for cancer diagnostics” gavasso et al issue an inspiring call for researchers to develop solutions addressing key problems in sustainable health care “we believe new and emerging technologies will allow us to move from mostly empirical decisions to tailored treatments enabling fast and early decisions regarding response” she said “it would be the holy grail even before treatment starts” in human medicine it’s difficult to predict who will respond to an immunotherapy the paper outlines an integral need for handson simple technology to monitor response over time rather than administering longterm treatment before differentiating between responders and nonresponders “mass cytometry has amazing potential i don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’ but it’s close to it this is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do” —sonia gavasso phd neuroimmunology lab haukeland university norway enter helios gavasso wanted to get a view of the immune system and how it behaves during therapy “one out of three people die from cancer and it’s increasing so something has to happen there’s a real need for singlecell analysis technologies that revolutionize what we can do in research to translate into clinical diagnostics and monitoring with cytof technology” she continued “we can go much deeper into whole system immunophenotyping to see where these medications actually work and where the antibody binds and has an effect this is a completely new holistic way to look at and monitor the immune system” when she heard about cytof technology in  gavasso remembered some were skeptical but she was thinking “‘we should absolutely do this’ i was fascinated and super excited about it” she visited scientists in paris who had a mass cytometer and recalled being amazed seeing it in action “in norway they like established procedures and technologies so we had to wait a long time but we didn’t give up” their helios™ was a gift to the haukeland university hospital and university in bergen funded through a bergen research foundation grant “we now have a helios system and it’s running really well we have our own dedicated mass cytometry team here to take care of the system and run mass cytometry at the hospital where we collect lots of cells in clinical trials” gavasso holds great hopes for mass cytometry citing around  major cryobanks collecting cell samples for mass cytometry applications in cancer rheumatic neurological and central nervous system diseases and advanced therapies like cryoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation “we plan to get another helios and we look forward to being able to expand our mass cytometry capabilities with tissue imaging” advantages over flow cytometry the visualization in mass cytometry data is a major plus for gavasso “with mass cytometry we’re finally getting a view of the elusive immune response in immune therapies disease systems are so complex it’s super that we can look at a certain cell but not lose information about what other cell types are doing or where they are within the immune system that is absolutely unbelievable” she said “previously this type of information was difficult to obtain in a single analysis with flow cytometry and mass cytometry clearly expands our horizon” she noted “so we can monitor complexity” her team reported debulking in leukemia during kinase inhibitor treatment as early as seven days after starting they also saw where a medicinal antibody binds and in which cell subtype “it is unprecedented we would not do this on the flow cytometer there are too many tubes that are difficult to combine and need lots of controls” gavasso gave the example of how medications come to the field after successful clinical trials but how they actually work is often unknown so researchers like her must rush to explain the mechanistic action for her mass cytometry is the technology to discover what immunemodulating compounds do in the immune system “i am a believer” she said “mass cytometry has amazing potential i don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’ but it’s close to it this is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do” her lab in bergen is currently running major helios projects for which they’re collecting tissue and cell samples for one study they’re using helios to monitor cryoimmunotherapy response in prostate cancer another involves developing stem cell transplant treatment approaches for ms and for leukemia using cytof technology to understand how the immune system reconstitutes after stem cell transplantation and immune ablation the team is also studying graft versus host disease in cancer “mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using it’s actually much much better” —sonia gavasso phd neuroimmunology lab haukeland university norway papers in the pipeline gavasso has a proofofprinciple chronic myeloid leukemia cml study of treatment with nilotinib tasigna® a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in press “we’d see clear changes three hours after initiating therapy and debulking after one week in this enest clinical trial substudy” the team has the opportunity to collect samples before therapy and again within hours of treatment because they work closely with treating physicians in their clinical trial units “in treatment” gavasso explained “those early tests provide valuable information so we don’t have to wait a whole year before we can label them responders or nonresponders” ultimately gavasso dreams of being able to analyze immune cells in the brain in nervous system diseases “it’s difficult to collect samples from within the central nervous system and if we do get them” she said “it would be really cool to have excellent technologies for analyzing samples at any level from rna to dna to proteomics” bioinformatics approach gavasso has several applications for working collaboratively with bioinformaticians to analyze biological programming algorithmic and statistical data from helios independent of what’s published her group works closely with lab mathematicians on topology studying spatial properties preserved through stretching crumpling bending and twisting of objects to verify methodological usability cytobank is a boon especially for studying the clinical dataset needed to integrate with information from the mass cytometer “cytof technology is better than how we did things before in the clinic when we had to always select cells and parameters this is really exciting” she added “mathematicians here in bergen actually come to us now asking for datasets” a new perspective mass cytometry for higherparameter analysis of precious samples offers a number of advantages “personally i was excited to let go of the twodimensional flow cytometry approach” she said “mass cytometry is amazing but some people find change difficult and are reluctant to go highdimension saying ‘we’ve been doing things this way forever it works so why change now’” gavasso’s answer “mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using it’s actually much much better” for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures   cell sorting directly to the c ifc maximize cell viability in ifcs when capturing rare and delicate subpopulations feature the c™

response with mass cytometry immunooncology panels feature maxpar human immunooncology ex panel kits designed for multiple product configurations the maxpar t cell immunooncology panel grants flexibility to choose complete coverage when combined with other t cell panels or to customize with individually selected markers of interest maximize data collected from limited oncology samples investigate t cell activity across all major subtypes at every stage of cancer treatment monitor checkpoint expression on t cells in response to treatment and correlate with outcome phenotype tumor infiltrates or other tissues in addition to blood the promising field of immunooncology presents many unanswered questions for scientists in biopharma cancer research flow and mass cytometry core facilities and immunology and immunooncology academic institutions how do cancer cells evade the immune system which cells and pathways are the best molecular targets what is the mechanism of action for potential pharmaceuticals how can we increase tumor immunogenicity which biomarkers could predict response which drugs offer the best treatment outcomes and in what order of use approaches based on immunotherapy are providing unprecedented benefits for cancer patients—most importantly durable responses and complete remission at rates that far surpass conventional chemotherapy the defining feature of immunotherapy is that t cells and other cell types in the immune system mediate the anticancer response but immune system cells also promote adverse reactions in some immunotherapy patients monitoring t cells and other immune cells in these patients is important for drug development understanding mechanisms of action and determining biomarkers that correlate with both response and adverse events “enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured using the unique power of mass cytometry the immunooncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care” —chris linthwaite president and ceo fluidigm the maxpar® human t cell immunooncology ex panel kit—together with the human t cell phenotyping panel kits—enables comprehensive identification of all major t cell subsets for determining activation homing status and checkpoint molecule expression designed for use with mass cytometry with capabilities for measuring more than  parameters per cell with little or no signal overlap these panels reveal highly valuable information from even the most limited biological samples modular configuration makes it easy to combine t cell phenotyping panel kits for flexible or complete coverage individual antibodies offer further customization for specific research needs with access to a growing catalog of more than  commercially available preconjugated antibodies and custom conjugation options the maxpar panel system can be adapted to meet changing needs in cancer immunotherapy research a new industry standard “the dynamic nature and inherent complexity of the antitumor immune response requires new approaches to deeply profile cell populations at singlecell resolution” said fluidigm president and ceo chris linthwaite “this new set of multiparameter panels will empower more researchers with highdimensional tools to interrogate the tumor immune response and the tumor microenvironment maximizing the information obtained from each precious sample” “enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured” linthwaite added “using the unique power of mass cytometry the immunooncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care” mass cytometry is fast becoming an industry standard for deep cellular profiling in translational and clinical research referenced by hundreds of peer reviewed publications mass cytometry expands beyond the inherent technical limitations of flow cytometry with minimal spectral overlap the technology enables researchers to interrogate more than  parameters simultaneously from millions of cells across both intracellular and extracellular protein markers sample case study as an example the journal of immunology published a paper by rituparna das et al “combination therapy with antictla and antipd leads to distinct immunologic changes in vivo” demonstrating highly multiplexed phenotyping of circulating immune cells to characterize immune response to individual and combination therapies the report detailed the team’s experimental approach in a patient cancer study at yale university and memorial sloan kettering cancer center das and her collaborators used mass cytometry to perform multiparameter immunophenotyping of human pbmcs from patients before and after they were administered antipd andor antictla checkpoint blockade therapy their customized marker panel included the marker maxpar human t cell phenotyping panel kit they reported that the population of ki cells increasing after antictla or combination checkpoint blockade had a phenotype of cdro ccr− cd cd and cd “consistent with transitional memory t cells” these same proliferating cells also upregulated mhc class ii hladr such deep profiling and identification of changes in this unique cell population would have been difficult using traditional approaches our new t cell immunooncology panel sets offer even deeper profiling than those used in the study cited above combining maxpar t cell and immunooncology panels creates an unprecedented tool for profiling t cells these panel sets also illustrate the power of mass cytometry as the premier platform for immune profiling and monitoring applications in translational and clinical research register for the th annual mass cytometry summit in boston on june  to learn about recent insights made using mass
