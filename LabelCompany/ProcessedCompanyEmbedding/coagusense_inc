contact coagusense introducing the coagsense™ ptinr monitoring system the first ptinr system to directly detect clot formation representing a breakthrough in ptinr testing design simplicity two million new people start taking the oral anticoagulant drug coumadin® warfarin every year to prevent blood clots heart attacks and stroke correct dosing of coumadin is determined for each patient by periodically measuring blood clotting time using the prothrombin time pt test the simplicity of the new coagsense system offers clinicians not only the performance they require but also the reliability they demand with the recent expansion in medicare coverage most patients on warfarin can now easily test their ptinr with confidence in their own home the coagsense system is available exclusively through a network of qualified distributors call  for ordering information intended use the coagsense selftest pt monitoring system is an in vitro diagnostic device that provides quantitative prothrombin time pt results expressed in seconds and international normalized ratio inr units it uses fresh capillary whole blood it is intended for use by properly selected and suitably trained patients or their caregivers on the order of the treating doctor patients should be stabilized on warfarintype coumarin anticoagulation therapy prior to selftesting with the coagsense selftest pt monitoring system it is not intended to be used for screening purposes contact us        coagusense inc      coagusense inc is iso  certified coagsense  information for professionals  ptinr monitoring system home patients professionals technology distributors contact coagsense accurate results in less than a minute the coagsense meter directly measures the prothrombin time so the time required to perform a test is the actual prothrombin time in seconds by not using lookup tables or curve fitting algorithms the coagsense meter offers both speed and accuracy superb precision coagsenses patented micro mechanical detection system delivers superb precision and reliability professionals testing with the coagsense system have demonstrated cvs of  unlike electrochemical detection based devices the coagsense system does not rely on the concentration of blood constituents not involved in clot formation to produce results this improves precision and reduces variability in readings often seen in other systems red blood cells not required because the coagsense system uses a micro mechanical means of clot detection instead of electrochemical recalcified plasma control strips can be run as easily as whole blood this also means that the coagsense system is not affected by low hemoglobin or hematocrit levels a common source of inaccurate results in systems using current to detect clot formation small sample size  µl minimum for easy dosing only µl of fingerstick sample is required to run the coagsense system to reduce strip waste caused by unsteady hands sample is easily transferred from the patients finger to the test strip using the minipipette or sample transfer tubes provided offers true controls using the actual thromboplastin and plasma the purpose of quality control testing for a prothrombin time test system is to verify the integrity of both device and reagent performance coagsense is the first system to offer true high and low control strips which contain the same thromboplastin used in the patient test strip along with plasma of known inr there is no substitute for confirming performance of the actual thromboplastin used in the patient test strips other benefits of the coagsense system include portable yet stable design barcoding on each test strip – no calibration code input or chip required no test strip refrigeration required no electrodes to clean or worry about enclosed detection wheel in each strip eliminates cross contamination risk ac powered or battery powered for convenience testing treatment and potential

represents a truly convenient testing option testing can easily be performed once a week in the comfort of your own home in addition to the convenience studies have shown that patients performing home ptinr testing spend more time in therapeutic range because they are able to monitor their trends¹ after each test patients notify their physician of the results and the physician will determine if any treatment adjustments are required the goal of selfmonitoring ptinr levels is to improve control and reduce the potential for adverse events you can learn more about testing your ptinr at home by

coagsense when clinicians and researchers want the most accurate means of determining prothrombin time they turn to either the world health organization who mechanical tilttube technique or the fibrometer both these methods use a mechanical approach to directly detect clot formation but they are cumbersome to perform the new coagsense ptinr monitoring system represents a breakthrough in pointofcare prothrombin time monitoring technology by miniaturizing and simplifying a direct mechanical means of detecting clot formation by directly detecting the clot the coagsense system avoids the challenges that plague other systems that use secondary means of clot detection like monitoring changes in impedance or pressure for example the concentration of red blood cells or other substances in blood sample can affect results in the measurement process of those products the coagsense system simply lifts the fibrin clot from the reaction well which interrupts a light beam the pt time is the actual time from when the blood sample is applied to when the clot is formed this produces results similar to the gold standard who tilttube methods as can be seen in the comparison graph below the new coagsense system offers healthcare professionals an easy and efficient way to obtain accurate and reliable ptinr results at the point of care now you can make immediate therapy adjustments and
