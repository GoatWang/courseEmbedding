print to printed circuit boards undefined   nano dimension has developed a pcb d printer and a suite of nanotechnology conductive and dielectric inks specifically for pcb professionals enabling the ability to take full control of pcb development and shortening time to market    nano dimensions dragonfly  d printer is a highly accurate and versatile inkjet deposition and curing system for printing professional multilayer circuit boards the dragonfly  d printer represents an evolution unlike anything the industry has seen before the innovative hardware dedicated nanoinks and novel software offers virtually limitless design flexibility to a wide range of research and development prototyping and custom manufacturing projects our highly conductive silver nano inks for electronics printing are also available separately   download dragonfly  d printer brochure   the rapid prototyping capabilities of the dragonfly  d printer for professional d printed electronics completely transforms the ways product development teams work no more waiting days or weeks for a custom pcb prototype that has to be fabricated offsite the dragonfly  d printer offers the flexibility to print an entire board or just part of a circuit you can develop the rf and digital sections of the board in parallel test and iterate on the fly the dragonfly  d printer empowers progress and encourages innovation lessening development risks and enabling faster timestomarket  and ultimately better products about the dragonfly  d printer high conductivity high performance components and materials for professional pcb production fast  efficient get prototypes on hand within hours not weeks flexible production creativity is not stifled by board complexity or layer count costeffective  secure no outsourcing equals low production costs and no ip security risks imagine these scenarios innovating freely without current manufacturing process constraints printing just some sections of your pcb for testing on the go printing vias and through holes without needing to drill being able to print pcbs onsite in a matter of minutes or hours take control of your pcb development join the early access  circuit board prototyping simplified we understand the challenges of creating a professional multilayer pcb you risk exposing your intellectual property to outsiders and have to negotiate high upfront setup prices its a frustrating balance of speed complexity creativity efficiency and cost until now   thats why we developed the dragonfly  d printer our latest white paper pcb prototyping inhouse or outsource takes an even more indepth look at the benefits that the different levels of an organisation from management to design can maximise from inhouse rapid pcb prototyping    download white paper   for more detailed and technical information on the dragonfly  d printer and how it prints circuit boards and makes d printed electronics a reality download the brochure here or scroll down to the faqs faq  does nano dimension also print using dielectric inks  yes      are there any limitations for the pcb because of the silverbased nano inks for example a maximum current or specific temperatures ranges or can the printed pcb used like regular copper based pcbs the ink will be engineered to behave as similarly to copper as chemistry allows     can the printed pcbs be soldered like any other pcb today   yes      are there any minmax numbers about the number of layers and the thickness   there is no limit to the number of layers beyond the mechanical height of the z axis    how green is the process how do i deal with remains of the inks and outofuse printed pcbs do i have to dispose the inks or the printed pcbs as hazardous waste   were keeping the process as green as possible the additive approach of d printing avoids the production chemicals and waste associated with standard pcb production    can you provide figures about the printing speed    this is dependent on the number of layers the complexity of the circuits and the board size a large complex layer board can take several hours to print    is there a special process to for curing the inks or is it just some kind of dry out   an integrated sintering process cures the inks to attain the right conductivity and adhesion    will the final software be able to import gerber files and able to print them directly    yes it works with gerber files and all that is needed is to set up the print job      when will the first printers be available for preorder   nano dimension began delivering the dragonfly  d printer to beta customers in q  the company is currently receiving preorders     do you plan to sell differentsized machines with different sized printing areas   eventually yes but for now the standard measurements are ca cm x cm    do you have a pricing scheme or range for the printer and the inks   please contact us for further details and discussion     what are the printing specifications   the printer prints ca  µm traces ca  µm interconnections and a minimum layer thickness of  µms   take control of your pcb development join the early access privacy policy careers

nano particle conductive inks engineered for printed electronics highly conductive silver inks for inkjet printers we are proud to present our stateoftheart agcite™ family of nanoparticle silver inks with unparalleled conductivity for inkjet deposition   nano dimension’s ink scientists can reliably extract  nanometersized particles of pure silver our ability to control the size shape and dispersion of the silver nanoparticles in accordance with the printing requirements of our customers is critical in formulating the best conductive inks available this allows us to achieve the highest ink performance optimization in properties such as conductivity adhesion and flexibility in a wide range of applications including rfid and oled from the particle level all the way through formulation to the printing process itself    the agcite™ family of inks sinters at low temperatures and is suited to a broad range of substrates including paper polymers glass and ito with unparalleled conductivity less ink is needed for the same application requirement bringing about major costsavings    download agcite ink brochure dielectric inks for inkjet printers nano dimension has also developed a suite of dielectric inks to meet the advanced needs of the electronics community the insulating properties of these materials is just as important and advanced as the conductive properties

efficiency and flexibility   nano dimension provides conductive inks specifically tailored for use in antennas including radiofrequency identification rfid technology for a variety of devices including smart cards various id products arrays and more   the agcite™ family of nanoparticle silver inks deposited by contactless digital inkjet printing deliver outstanding results third party tests demonstrate the inks matching industry efficiency benchmarks with  antenna efficiency at  ghz      as well as delivering unparalleled conductivity this process replaces the etching process used for making most copper antennas which is expensive inflexible and creates toxic waste additional benefits include digital manufacturing flexibility as well as excellent printed line and space resolution this allows antenna designers more flexibility when addressing the demanding requirements of today’s antenna applications   chemistry  nano dimension boasts two fullyequipped ink laboratories one focuses on the research and production of conductive inks while the other focuses on dielectric inks the labs primarily generate silver nanoparticle inks and nanopolymers for use with the dragonfly  pcb d printer and also work with a variety of customers on their advanced and customized ink requirements     our silver nanoparticle inkjet inks are based on a breakthrough
