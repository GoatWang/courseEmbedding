unions pay on savings the national average annual percentage yield for savings accounts is currently  as published in the fdic weekly national rates and rate caps generally most local credit unions

the money to keep up buildings landscapes parking lots lots of employees and equipment etc this allows online banks to pay a much higher interest rate to their depositors online banks are just as safe and secure as your local banks and credit unions you access all your account information including making transfers and deposits through your computer andor smart phone many of the banks also have an app that allows you to take a photo of a check and deposit it into your checking or savings account are online banks convenient yes you can access all your account information easily through a safe and secure website andor phone app depending on the bank just connect your current bank with your new high yield online account and start earning  times more interest than the national average today

a credit union you must be a member of their establishment a new account representative will direct you through the account opening process before opening the ira some initial questions should be asked which tax year will the contribution be going towards will the contribution be made in one lump sum or over the course of the year these questions are important to ask yourself before going into open the ira knowing which tax year the contribution will be applied toward is very important because the contribution can be applied to last years taxes until april th of the next year by knowing if the contribution will be made in one lump sum or in smaller payments over the course of the year this will determine what type of account designation can be used there is certain information that is needed in order for an ira to be opened the information that is needed is found on the banks application the application that we will follow is from zions bank please refer to the application if there are any questions on where a section is located here are some step by step instructions on how to fill out an application in order to get an ira  fill out customer information as needed name social security number demographics etc  mark the appropriate box of where the source of the ira funds will be coming from  write the name of the beneficiary ies including their address relationship social security number date of birth and the percentage of the ira that they will receive in the event that something were to happen to you the percentages for all beneficiaries should equal to  percent  write the name of the contingent beneficiary ies the contingent beneficiary is the beneficiary to the beneficiary  read the fine print under the section of the beneficiary designation  if the money is going to be invested by a brokerage firm write in the name of the brokerage company along with the address and telephone number  read the print in the agreement to participate section noting that it states that the information that has been given is true and accurate to your knowledge  verify the information making sure all areas are complete and accurate  sign the signature line that states “signature of participant”  ask any questions to the new account representative after the application is completed and the agreement to participate has been signed the account representative will give you a copy of everything you have signed along with information that states the account terms and the guidelines for the ira conclusion an individual retirement account is essential to all of us planning for our future is very important especially when we want to be financially secure knowing that in your future you have money saved can eliminate the worries of how you will live at the time of retirement living off of social security is not the answer retirement is a very important time for all individuals and making sure that your retirement is secure is one of the best things that you can do and the traditional ira can help to accomplish this security retirement planning is essential to everyones future and one of the best ways to put away money for your future is with an ira the traditional ira has many benefits that include tax deductibility taxdeferred growth and no income limits saving for retirement is made easier with the traditional ira because taxes are paid at retirement and when a lower tax bracket could be present being able to put money into a traditional ira can help many individuals get a tax break something most everyone would like the traditional ira has many benefits that can help many individuals but stipulations are present and not everyone is helped by a traditional ira so for those without an individual retirement account we recommend that you visit your bank of choice and start saving for your retirement today and don’t forget the earlier you start the better prepared you will be for your future money matters compound interest money

and redemptions largely offsetting each other the sec felt it had to address concerns that money market funds may contribute to financial instabilitythe final amendments to money market rules that were made in  aim to protect shareholders from the impacts that a flood of redemptions could have on money market funds the amendments are also intended to give fund managers time to respond to

welcome to todays discussion on money market funds well discuss the changes in regulations of money market funds and how vanguard investors are affectedand with us today are david glocke and justin schwartz of vanguards fixed income group the group responsible for managing vanguards money market funds gentlemen thanks for being here todayjustin schwartz thank youdavid glocke thank youamy chain justin get us started tell us a little bit about some of the changes coming to money market fundsjustin schwartz i think the most important thing to note is that for most of our shareholders not a lot is going to change but we are happy to go through a couple of the key changes here today and the first thing id like to get started on is enhanced disclosureso our shareholders are going to have some increased transparency into the portfolios and thats going to take place through the website so well have daily website disclosure on our daily and weekly liquid assets that we hold in the portfolio in addition theyll be able to see a marketbased value of the portfolio something different from money market funds this will be taken out to the fourth decimal place its important to note that this is not the share price that investors will be transacting at well strive to maintain a stable  nav in all of our money market fundsin addition to that well be posting daily shareholder cash flows on the web page so shareholders will have a better insight into whats going on to the fund day in and day outin addition to that we do currently report holdings detailed portfolio holdings to the sec at the end of every month those are currently available on a day lag and after april  our shareholders will be able to access those through the secs website and actually theres a link on our website as well immediately after postingdavid glocke in addition to that a couple of things that investors are probably going to start hearing about is the sec allowed the money market funds to not just offer the stable net asset value portfolios which clients have gotten used to for the last  years but to also go ahead and offer floatingrate net asset value type portfolios and weve decided at vanguard thats not really where we want to go we just want to offer the stable nav traditionaltype money market funds that clients are used to so those are the products that well offeralso theyll hear something about fees and gates so the sec is going ahead and allowing boards of directors of portfolios to implement fees and gates which we would expect would be implemented in times of extreme stress the trigger mechanism for that is something thats going to be displayed on our website through the enhanced disclosure which represents the amount of weekly liquidity in the fundas long as the portfolio has at least  weekly liquidity in the portfolio the board of directors wont have to consider whether they need to implement fees and gates so what weve done is weve enhanced the amount of liquidity in our funds to around  in total assets and we think thats going to give us enough of a buffer to go ahead and avoid the times where we might have to turn around and implement thatand in addition to the government funds that we offer wont have fees and gates apply to them at all the sec allowed the board of directors to go ahead and opt out of that for government funds and vanguards board chose to do thatamy chain how about from the perspective of managing our money market funds do these regulatory changes bring any changes to the way we manage moneydavid glocke really i mean on the taxable side theres not a lot of changes other than enhancing the amount of liquidity during the financial crisis in particular during the lehman period when things were really volatile we lost less than  of our assets over the course of a week so having that additional buffer from  to  i think gives us a lot of comfort knowing that we can go ahead and deal with anything that comes up day to dayand certainly as we did during the financial crisis if we saw conditions eroding in the markets we would turn around and enhance that to go ahead and make sure that we had an even larger buffer again similar to the way we managed the cash back in that time periodamy chain pause for a minute and tell me a little bit about why liquidity is important in a money market funddavid glocke well its interesting i mean a money market fund allows investors to go ahead and transact in their portfolios all the time we dont have any restrictions and so like a bank we would have to have certain assets on hand to go ahead and meet redemptions and we do that through maturities assets that are coming due on a daily basis and also our bank would go ahead and invest more longterm money market funds invest shortterm so we have average maturity thats determined by the sec which has to be  days or lessamy chain so all of the securities within the money market portfolios have maturities of  days or less or a large majority of themdavid glocke not necessarily theyll have maturities that can go out a bit further but the average maturity of the overall portfolio has to be  days or less so its common for us to go out and buy sixmonth bank cds and put that in the portfolio but well have a large weight of shortterm assets which offset thatand so theres always a constant flow of maturities coming due in the portfolio to meet redemptions so on top of that the sec wants us to have more liquidity and so for us in prime money market i go out and i buy us treasury securities or i might go out and buy an agency security which are very highly liquid and also qualify as weekly liquidity for the sec rulesjustin schwartz and on the municipal side id say very little has changed in terms of how we manage the portfolios the securities that are available for money market funds in the municipal market are actually structured such that they qualify for daily or weekly liquid assets so traditionally even dating back before the financial crisis municipal money market funds ran about  to  in what today qualifies as weekly liquid assetsamy chain certainly we have many many investors who are investors in our money market funds many of them through our brokerage accounts talk to me about how these policy changes impact our investorsjustin schwartz thats probably one of the biggest areas of change that our shareholders will see so as a result of the reform vanguard has decided to only offer the vanguard federal money market fund as a settlement option and a brokerage accountas david mentioned before government funds are not subject to fees and gates and theyre open to all investors so with vanguard brokerage thought that would be the best option for clients it is important to note that they can continue to use all the vanguard money market funds as they do today with the exception of settling brokerage tradesamy chain so your settlement fund and your brokerage account has to be the federal money market fund otherwise any impacts to investorsdavid glocke yes i could go ahead and have a federal money market account to handle any stock trades that i might want to do but i can still have my cash in another account whether its a taxexempt money market fund or prime money market so i can continue to maintain that same investment profile but then just transfer the money over as i need it to deal with brokerage tradesjustin schwartz its a good opportunity for investors to think about what they value in their money market fund whether its taxexempt income or in the case of a prime fund maybe a slightly higher yield than a government portfolio so those are decisions and things that the clients may want to consideramy chain are there any strategies that investors should be considering to minimize the impact of these changesdavid glocke the strategies that were hearing about and seeing people execute on we know that vanguard introduced an ultrashort bond fund recently so its positioned right between a money market fund and a shortterm bond fund its a variable nav fund very similar to a bond fund but it buys shorterduration assets so thats where its maturity profile would be right between the twoand weve seen a lot of interest in that product investors considering that mostly though from investors who have money maybe in money market funds that recognize at this point that maybe its time to take some of that cash that has traditionally been longterm cash in the money market fund and move it into something that offers a better opportunity for returnsjustin schwartz and we have a municipal product shortterm taxexempt fund that has a similar maturity and duration profile to the ultrashortterm taxable fund that is available for clients as well who desire the taxexempt incomedavid glocke in this lowyield environment that we finally are starting to move out of very slowly a lot of clients were looking for a way to go ahead and get a higher return but yet not necessarily to go into the more traditionaltype bond funds so these products give investors who have that risk profile an opportunity to do something a bit differentamy chain weve talked a little bit about nav or nav today can you define that for us what does that mean and what do shareholders need to know about itdavid glocke really i guess the net asset value of the portfolio is the level the price of the fund that youre transacting in so when you think of net asset value in the money market fund its traditionally been the dollar a buck and thats how a lot of times how well turn around and refer to it whereas the floating nav or floating net asset value portfolios really price more like bond funds on the money market side they would be shorterduration in nature and so they wouldnt have as much volatility obviously as a bond fundbut i think a lot of clients really prefer to go ahead and know that when theyre transacting its  in  out its never a guarantee we can say that over and over and its in all the prospectus we have a long tradition of very conservative investment management and we feel very comfortable that our investmentstyle approach that vanguard has will go ahead and keep us where we should beamy chain david you also talked a little bit about fees and gates today can you define them for usdavid glocke sure so the fees and gates are associated again with when you go ahead and drop below  the board of directors at that point has the opportunity to decide if they want to go ahead and present a fee a redemption fee or gate where they control the flow above the cash they go ahead and leaveamy chain the idea would be if there is volatility in the market such that were afraid there would be mass redemptions from a money market fund these fees or gates would slow down the outflow to protect shareholders of the fundamy chain lets sum up some of what weve talked about today any final thoughts to sharedavid glocke i think really for most vanguard clients there arent a lot of changes that are going to impact the way that they use their money market funds todayjustin schwartz and as we talked a little bit about before for brokerage clients the settlement fund change will happen and when it does theyll just need to make sure that when they do a brokerage transaction that theyre funding that account to settle the trade other than that they can continue to maintain their position in their prime or taxexempt money market funds that they have todayamy chain gentlemen thank you so much for sharing with us today we covered a lot of

you choose or believe you have received an inaccurate quote please let us know rates proudly powered by frequently asked questions what interest rates do my local banks and credit unions pay on savings the national average annual percentage yield for savings accounts is currently  as published in the fdic weekly national rates and rate caps generally most local credit unions and banks pay less than  many of them pay only  wouldnt you rather earn  times more interest than the average by taking  minutes to open up a new high yield savings account what exactly is an online bank online banks are exactly the same as your local banks and credit unions however they dont have tens hundreds or even thousands of locations around the country this means they dont need to spend the money to keep up buildings landscapes parking lots lots of employees and equipment etc this allows online banks to pay a much higher interest rate to their depositors online banks are just as safe and secure as your local banks and credit unions you access all your account information including making transfers and deposits through your computer andor smart phone many of the banks also have an app that allows you to take a photo of a check and deposit it into your checking or savings account are online banks convenient yes you can access all your account information easily through a safe and secure website andor phone app depending on the bank just connect your current bank with your new high yield online account and start earning  times more interest than the national average today many online savings accounts also allow you to use certain atms at no charge or reimburse you for a certain number of atm withdrawals per month how do i deposit funds into an online bank it depends on the bank but most offer the ability to make deposits in the following ways online transfer ach  you first need to link your current checkingsavings account to your online bank account mobile deposit  use the banks app to take a photo of your check and submit it securely wire transfer check by mail are these online banks safe what does fdic or ncua mean all the banks or credit unions we advertise are fdic or ncua insured meaning your money is backed by the federal deposit insurance corporation of the united states government up to  per depositor per bank for each ownership category the fdic sells insurance policies to banks which then insures the savings accounts checking accounts certain retirement accounts trust accounts and several other types of accounts against bank failure the fdic does not cover investment accounts such as mutual funds life insurance stocks bonds and annuities ncua stands for the national credit union administration and it is an independent federal agency backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the ncua insures savings accounts checking accounts certificates of deposit and money market accounts up to  the same as the fdic do i have to close my current bank account no it is actually very convenient to have a local bank you can go into to get cash deposit checks get cashiers checks etc however most local banks provide very low interest rates   theres no reason for you to leave your savings sitting in account that makes almost zero interest you can easily connect your existing local bank account with an online high yield savings or cd account and transfer your savings in just a few minutes and watch the interest  accumulate each month is  apy really worth opening up a new savings account yes if you deposit  into your new high

a credit union you must be a member of their establishment a new account representative will direct you through the account opening process before opening the ira some initial questions should be asked which tax year will the contribution be going towards will the contribution be made in one lump sum or over the course of the year these questions are important to ask yourself before going into open the ira knowing which tax year the contribution will be applied toward is very important because the contribution can be applied to last years taxes until april th of the next year by knowing if the contribution will be made in one lump sum or in smaller payments over the course of the year this will determine what type of account designation can be used there is certain information that is needed in order for an ira to be opened the information that is needed is found on the banks application the application that we will follow is from zions bank please refer to the application if there are any questions on where a section is located here are some step by step instructions on how to fill out an application in order to get an ira  fill out customer information as needed name social security number demographics etc  mark the appropriate box of where the source of the ira funds will be coming from  write the name of the beneficiary ies including their address relationship social security number date of birth and the percentage of the ira that they will receive in the event that something were to happen to you the percentages for all beneficiaries should equal to  percent  write the name of the contingent beneficiary ies the contingent beneficiary is the beneficiary to the beneficiary  read the fine print under the section of the beneficiary designation  if the money is going to be invested by a brokerage firm write in the name of the brokerage company along with the address and telephone number  read the print in the agreement to participate section noting that it states that the information that has been given is true and accurate to your knowledge  verify the information making sure all areas are complete and accurate  sign the signature line that states “signature of participant”  ask any questions to the new account representative after the application is completed and the agreement to participate has been signed the account representative will give you a copy of everything you have signed along with information that states the account terms and the guidelines for the ira conclusion an individual retirement account is essential to all of us planning for our future is very important especially when we want to be financially secure knowing that in your future you have money saved can eliminate the worries of how you will live at the time of retirement living off of social security is not the answer retirement is a very important time for all individuals and making sure that your retirement is secure is one of the best things that you can do and the traditional ira can help to accomplish this security retirement planning is essential to everyones future and one of the best ways to put away money for your future is with an ira the traditional ira has many benefits that include tax deductibility taxdeferred growth and no income limits saving for retirement is made easier with the traditional ira because taxes are paid at retirement and when a lower tax bracket could be present being able to put money into a traditional ira can help many individuals get a tax break something most everyone would like the traditional ira has many benefits that can help many individuals but stipulations are present and not everyone is helped by a traditional ira so for those without an individual retirement account we recommend that you visit your bank of choice and start saving for your retirement today and don’t forget the earlier you start the better prepared you will be for your future money matters compound interest money
