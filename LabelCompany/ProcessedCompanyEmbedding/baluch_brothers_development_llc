pile rugs of the baluch and their neighbors by dr dietrich h g wegner translated from german by lola froehlich august  reviewed by dr wegner may  this five part article first appeared in oriental rug review vol  no  july  reproduced here with permission by ron ocallaghan baluch nomads foreword by tom cole for anyone who plans to study this voluminous text i will not bore you with excessive verbiage i thought it somewhat important to make this presentation at the same time as the interview with jerry anderson published in hali  providing a single reference for much of what we know and do not know about baluch weavings dr wegners contribution at a relatively early time in baluch studies was commendable but fraught with numerous errors as well as misattributions some of the captions to the photos have additional commentary in parentheses written by me i have a problem with dr wegners statement regarding the relationship of the baluch people to the hordes of ancient inner asia from which he unequivocally concludes the turkic design pool of baluch weavings is a derivative process and not original to those people his dating is suspect offered without explanation or qualification designating the provenance of many of the rugs to seistan seems at this point in time with the experiences i have had in the region fallacious and confused additionally he does not illustrate even one pile weaving that is typical of the seistan aesthetic identifying fig  as a product of the doktor i ghazi of afghanistan is probably mistaken as well based merely upon a design element in the field without consideration of palette and structure what can be said about this text is that it represents the culmination of dr wegners studies and observations in the field circa the s  s the value of his field work is inargueable if at times flawed but for all of its shortcomings the article is an useful resource for those interested in further understanding the weavings of the baluch part  go to part   part   part   part  pile rugs are an important part of the material culture of central asian peoples the attraction that emanates from these textiles inspires us to learn more about the people that produce them traditional patterns and colors the way to combine them as well as the material and the techniques of production are often determined by the ethnic origin of the weavers this background also explains the way in which man and his product reflect foreign influences this aspect for the baluch and their rugs shall be studied in the following series history and geographical distribution of the baluch exact dates concerning the history of the baluch are rare conclusions about their origin are all based on linguistic studies according to these baluch is a separate indoeuropean language with relations to the middle persian the kurdish and the parthian languages this indicates an original home south of the caspian sea elfenbein  history mentions the baluch for the first time as nomads in the area of kirman whichwas conquered by the arabs in  in response to the expansion of the seljuks the baluch began to evade and retreat to the southeast at the end of the th century continuous massive raids by the baluch into khorassan and sistan triggered counter attacks during which they suffered heavy losses their defeat at khabis by masud of ghazna was very probably decisive forcing the majority of the baluch to move through sistan into the area that is today known as baluchistan frye  in the east at the coast of the indian ocean called mekran they came upon the djat and further north upon the brahui nomads who were partly absorbed by the baluch until the th century groups of these eastern baluch spread into sindh and further into pandjab there they are mentioned among the troops that helped the mogul emperor homayun to conquer delhi frye  it is interesting to note that the baluch never formed influential political organizations as we know of them from turks and turkomans but even subtribes and clans kept kept their total independence to the point of fierce battles developing among themselves the accompanying map explains the actual distribution of the baluch though incompletely and does not tell us anything about the history of the baluch north of sistan in a hundreds of kilometers wide strip east and west of todays iranianafghan border and up to the soviet turkmen republic the history of those baluch is however of utmost interest since only they who actually live outside the geographical region of baluchistan have a tradition of pile weaving the patterns in their rugs lead us to the question why these north baluch do not utilize typical baluch motifs as they are used by their southern brothers but rather apply ethnologically foreign turkoman designs among those designs are especially in older rugs very attractive tribal guls the answer to that may lie in the fact that these baluch had close contacts to turkoman tribes whose tribal device they had to learn to reproduce as soon as they fell under turkoman rule moshkova  a hint at the possibility of very early contacts can be found in moinuddin isifizaris rauzat ul jannatfilausafimadinatlherat tate  and bijarani  according to this the baluch nomads constituted already in the th century a great part of the population in the area north of herat and up to the region of badghiz oral history yate  and wegner  underlines the above report with all required discretion one can imagine how baluch from sistan came into this region that up until the th century always had been influenced by turkomans without doubt later on baluch groups came also from sistan to the north that is during the reign of nadir shah  to  who was safavi governor of sistan at the beginning of his career in  he freed north khorassan from uzbeks and turkomans during his successful expeditions against bokhara and khiva sykes ii  after his death however many of those regions came again under uzbek and turkoman domain vambery ii  consequently the population there became once again very dependent on the turkomans this development may have caused a gradual migration back towards sistan by parts of the baluch during which smaller groups settled in the area of todays khorassan where they are still living in light of this background it becomes clear that turkoman influences made the pile rug weaving tradition among these baluch not only possible but even caused it all of this was a slow development over a long span of time because baluch have tended to hold on to their traditions in spite of constant and sometimes aggressive foreign influences from their neighbors who have outnumbered them by far and who have been very conscious of their own traditions up to today many groups of khorassan baluch have preserved not only their own language and own family structure but also some other customs for example the form of their tents this points to the fact that the introduction and the spread of originally unknown technique of pile rug weaving the adoption and modification of foreign turkoman symbolism and the development of the baluchs own patterns started a long time before and not at the time of nadir shah as is often assumed edwards  eiland  baluch nomadic tribespeople camped in the murghab river area entertain a recruiting officer from one side or the other during the russian civil war c  flatweave fabrics and pileweave rugs it needs to be pointed out that contrary to widespread opinion there is no old tradition of pile rug weaving in baluchistan itself imp gaz ind  besides that another kind of geometrical design dominates there up to today embroidered patterns from sarhad southern persian baluchistan resemble ornaments on baluch tombs near thatta chaukanditombs which date back to the middle of the th century zajadaczhastenrath foll likewise forms and colors of embroideries from mejran pakistan baluchistan do not reflect any distinct turk ornaments as do similar pieces from baluch areas from sistan on to the north the baluch of baluchistan have however a long tradition in the making of pileless fabrics imp gaz ind  konieczny  mainly saddle bags and storage sacks are flatwoven for rare floor coverings woven pieces about cm wide are sewn together lengthwise so that pieces of xcm are obtained very often they have small white andor red geometric patterns in horizontal rows on a mostly very dark background the borderline between the pile rug and the pileless rug weaving khorassan baluch and the only pileless rug weaving baluchistan baluch ran around the middle of this century through iran approximately from the area around iranshar in the south of the lut desert to the east through the northern part of the region of kwash and on across todays iranian pakistani border through the area south of quetta toward kelat it is obvious that this border considering the mobility of the baluch cannot be very rigid due to the growing construction of roads and highways especially in iran in the last decades this border might have been shifted further to the south in the same measure as modern commercial demand has created new cottage industries in areas that were inaccessible up to then it is more difficult to determine the borders of the east persianwest afghan territory of the pile rug weaving baluch towards the other directions to the east their number diminishes gradually towards a northsouth zone which goes roughly from quetta in todays pakistan to the amu darya river in northeast afghanistan single clans were however still to be found in northwest pakistan india and even in the western part of chinese turkestan in the north they reach into the soviet turkmen republic pikulin  where according to russian information  about  baluch were settled in kholkhoes benningsen  gafferberg  there pile rugs are probably no longer produced in great numbers only very few baluch are to be found west of the deserts lut and kavir in northwest iran some products of the shahsavan point to the possibility that also baluch did partake in the development of this recent and rather heterogeneous formation fig  mushwani baluch northest afghanistan c  probably a symmetrically knotted rug from the group identified as bahlul mushwani is an antiquated term referring to a design type rather than tribal weavers  tc identification of baluch tribes in recent years growing government authority in afghanistan pakistan and especially in persian khorassan has limited the freedom and mobility of the baluch it is nevertheless difficult to identify specific clans over a longer period of time even the name of the nahrui a tribe that was mentioned several times in history pottinger  bijarani  tate  is hardly remembered among khorassan baluch nowadays even though they themselves probably belonged to that tribe originally it seems that today some tribes still like to rename themselves after their khans who were of singlemost importance to them one example are the salarkhani the part that returned however adopted the name saidmohammedkhani in  they consisted of  people and possessed about  sheep and more than  camels the khodadadkhani who settled about  kilometers northwest of the latter are supposedly a splinter group of the salarkhani edwards  calls the salarkhani also kurkheili a name that was no longer in use ten years later former afghan pastures after the death of nadir shah these peoples are partly of iranian partly of turkmongol origin and belong to the loose confederation of the tsharar aimaq chahar aimaq the four peoples sometimes the above mentioned timuri are also said to be one of those a further example are the gharai baluch they settled down in the territory of the gharai tribe about  years ago and called themselves after their protectors similarly the name of the djanbeghi neighbors of the saidmohammeddjanbeghi neighbors of the saidmohammedkhani could allude to a former dependence of a subdivision of the herzegi with the same name the herzegi are a subtribe of the saryk turkoman also the name of the tshubdari in the area of kashmar reminds us of the tshaudor choudor turkoman these observations explains why it is with little success today to search for the baluch tribal names that were gathered by among others pottinger  bellow  and tate  it also shows why among baluch it is far more difficult to attribute certain rug patterns to a clearer definable group of pile rug weavers than it is among turkomans it seems more meaningful to classify the patterns according to the geographical regions in which thay are most often found fig  fathollahi baluch sistan with afshar medallion c  probably not from seistan but rather a group of weavers located in khorassan the rug is probably woven with an asymmetric knot open right suggesting a turkic ethnic origin for the weavers possibly related ethnically to the afshars of kerman accounting for the use of such a central medallion  tc the ethnic environment of the baluch a regional classification allows us to also include those pattern modifications that originated in the same area that are however obviously not made by baluch but were developed when their producers learned the technique of knotting carpets from the baluch wegner  ibid   these circumstances could be studied closer in some djulghe valleys east of turbettiheidari between  and  besides a multitude of baluch clans some seminomad village communities were found here which had immigrated from the farther east lying main territory of the timuri around  maitland  and lived under a tribal name of their own among those immigrants the moreidari and their subdivision the sarbuzi the elkhani and the boruti in the djulghe khaf have traditional independent pattern variants in the further north situated djulghe barkharz appear the porbuzi and the seldjuqi as original timuri and in the even further north djulghe djam the sangtshuli only the moghulzadeh in the djulghe khaf and the mokhtari maintain that they are not baluch the classification of the yaqubkhani is also unsure because they consider themselves baluch edwards  as well as timuri today the timuri are mainly to be found in west afghanistan ethnologically they do not belong to the iranian people their original home in the region of bokhara makes a turkmongol derivation more probable than an arab one claimed for reason of alleged greater distinction maitland  the afghan timuri produce pile rugs too many of their tribal devices can however not be sufficiently identified apart from the yaqubkhani who are also to be found in afghanistan the subtribes of the kaudani also kuduani the shirkhani and the zakani have acquired a good reputation as pile rug weavers janata  and  the bahluri also are one of the main foreign family units among the baluch they are to be found in northeast and east khorassan between tayabad and ghain as well as in afghanistan they were still camelraising nomads around  according to their tradition they are originally west iranian turks thet were resettled to khorassan by shah abbas  because they were notorious troublemakers in their pile rugs they have modified elements of baluch patterns so much that the inner relation to the typical baluch symbolism of these motifs is missing pile rugs with baluch features cruder though and not as plentiful are also found among the firuskuni and taimani they live today as farmers and semi nomads in rather confined areas in west afghanistan north and east of herat and south down to the region of adreskand the djamshidi live here also according to janata oral information  the question arises whether their subtribe the maududi is identical with the mushawani whose typical pileweave rugs fig  were mentioned in more recent publications eiland  about  djamshidi moved into the area of meshhed in persian north khorassan only after  janata  firuzkuhi are also still to be found in iran in the area south of nishapur bellew  presumably they stayed behind when their tribe which had been resettled their by nadir shah returned to their former afghan pastures after the death of nadir shah these peoples are partly of iranian partly of turkmongol origin and belong to the loose confederation of the tsharar aimaq chahar aimaq the four peoples sometimes the above mentioned timuri are also said to be one of those we do not know of any pile rugs made by the three first mentioned peoples before  and there are no pieces in which natural dyes are used exclusively this leads us to the conclusion that they learned how to knot rugs in very recent times probably from the neighboring baluch the flatweave products of those groups seem to be of more significance than their pileweave products small and big saddlebags old and new ones all have the same typical patterns that janata  and bolland  reported from the afghan djamshidi and firuzkuhi such bags were still sold in the bazaars of meshhed between  and  since their patterns remotely resemble the ornaments on webends of baluch carpets dealers sold them as baluch rugs locating the place of production however within a wide area around meshhed it can therefore be assumed that these fabrics were made by the already mentioned splinter groups of the tshahar aimaq in khorassan another proof for that is the fact that none of the pieces whose provenance was determined were brought from afghanistan as personal property of pilgrims and other travellers and later sold in meshhed tent bands from the afghan firuzkuhi remind us of the ornaments of the pathan ghilzai or even of the turkoman beshiri while the patterns of the taimani resemble sometimes those of the mishmast another nomad aimaq group in west afghanistan janata  and  fig  the pile rug weaving group of the socalled arabs also needs to be mentioned more because of geographical proximity than because of similarities of their carpets with those of the baluch these arabs are almost without exception villagers who became sedentary a long time ago and who derive their name  maybe out of reasons of prestige  from those arabs who islamized their homeland in the th century their main settlements are in the area of ferdows with ayask arisk dohuk seghale and serayan as the most important pile rug weaving centers in  motifs structures and colors of those farmers carpets seldom resemble products made by baluch from the same area apart from a few exceptions most of the pieces are coarsely knotted had a long pile and were very colorful they were a favorite among the rich arabs from the emirates of the persian gulf who preferred the summer in iran to that of an even hotter home country the demand caused an almost assemblyline type of cottage industry  a general degradation of the product and to a very superficial reproduction of the patterns we see very crude afshar designs in the central field and even more so in the borders these pile rugs must however not be confused with other carpets that also have a distinct afshar influence that were without doubt made by baluch in sistan about  kilometers from ferdows in contrast to arab products these sistan baluch rugs have central fields rich with small carefully designed motifs and a stepped andor incised central medallion similar to those on runners made by southeast iranian afshar fig  the main border has an alternating latchhook pattern which is favored by some baluch groups but is originally a turkoman pattern fig  fig  arabzadeh kheibar salor gul and keshmiri pattern c  as a rule the fabric structure of these rugs points to baluch weavers some fabrics from very small groups who were seminomadic at least until  and who call themselves and are called by their neighboring baluch arabzadeh descendants of the arabs show how difficult it is to classify the rugs in  a group of  arabzadeh could be in close neighborhood to the moreidari and the saidmohammadkhani in the eastern djulghe khaf the few small pieces they had woven however were not distinguished from those made by the moreidari fig  in order to complete the study of the ethnological environment that influenced the pileweave products of the baluch the brahui and the shadlu need to be mentioned as concerns the brahui it has been said above that the baluch absorbed many units of them  although they belong to the dravadian language group of south india however independent brahui are still to be found in sistan tate   baluchistan imp gaz ind  in the area of herat snoy  and in the turkmen ssr gafferberg  pile rug weaving baluch lived close to them in many of these regions we do not know of any pieces that can definitely be assigned to the brahui maybe their name was transmorgrified to barawi a group of pile rug weavers that supposedly belong to the sistan baluch only isolated pieces of their pile rugs with typical but rather meaningless designs were found the shadlu belong to the kurdish tribes which were resettled by shah abbas to the northern khorassan border as protection against the uzbeks sykes  up until today the kurds have held on to their caucasian influenced designs which they had imported from northwest persia they weave easily identifiable long piled runners and rugs of much greater size than are produced by the neighboring baluch between  and  the shadlu around budjnurd made saddlebags that cannot be distinguished neither in the technique nor in the design from very good baluch products part  go to part   part   part   part  pile and pileless rugs are made by female weavers as it is true also for the turkomans if a horizontal collapsible wooden loom is used irregular formats do not disclose an unskillful weaver but her nomadic way of life a not yet finished piece was rolled around the warp beams of the disassembled frame when the group moved on to another pasture the frame was then not readjusted accurately at the new location sheeps wool and more rarely camel wool is used for the pile this wool looks dull in a new piece and gets its attractive sheen only after longer use since in recent time balouch carpets have been in great demand for export local dealers thought they could abbreviate this process and had rugs made with synthetic silk whenever such a material was available these products were offered in europe as especially valuable the use of silk is indeed very rare until recently it was only used to accentuate certain colors that were not easily obtained in wool with natural dyes eg green and purple for about  years metal threads have been incorporated every now and then undyed or brown sheeps wool or sheeps wool mixed with black goats hair is much used for warp and weft the small sides of the rugs have dark webends with very delicately woven or embroidered ornaments in white andor red some older pieces have webends that are woven in kilim fashion stepped or undulating stripes are formed through color changes eg from medium blue to red to black to medium blue there are also rugs without webends from the second half of the last century more recent pieces have  to  cm wide webends which are usually devoid of ornaments balouch in the afghan province of herat preserved the tradition of webend ornaments longer than those in the area of turbettiheidari in herat pieces with elaborate ornaments in webends were still rather recently produced  the fringes are either twined or braided some times there are knots close to the webends that may have special colorful weft threads to prevent unraveling of the pile very often the fringes of the lower terminating end are more carefully finished than the ones at the beginning upper end the finish of the selvage is very characteristic it is twined two to four times with black goats hair and shows sometimes a herringbone pattern rhe pile is knotted onto the warp threads applying the asymmetrical persian or senneh knot the tekke and salor turkomans use the same knots in their carpets azadi  baluch village in seistan region of iran this photo depicts apparently sedentary village life with round mud walls with a thatch roof composed of reeds photo courtesy baloch circle this and the fact rhat the khorassan balouch used tekke and salor tribal devices leads us to assume once again that the khorassan balouch learned the skill of knotting rugs particularly from those turkomans black  and eiland  examined a great number of balouch carpets and found out that  of the knots were of the symmetrical ghiordes kind this might be partly explained by the fact that the authors did not analyze the rugs onsite maybe they are not original balouch products but were made by timuri it is also possible that the rugs are indeed of balouch provenance but that the weaver had a different ethnic origin and applied her techniques when she married into a balouch tribe fine pieces have  knots to a square dcm and each weft thread bears pile those products are as valuable as the tekke and salor rugs but due to the different kind of wool they are still softer than comparable turkoman rugs the salarkhani the said mohammadkhani the gharai beluchi the ali akbarkhani in the iranian region of turbettiheidari and the afghan dokhtareghazi made rugs of this quality they very rarely reached the bazaars of meshed and herat or even europe products of minor quality were known there and mistakenly taken as characteristic of baluch work those rugs are loosely knotted with coarse yarn and are very soft or even flabby they were made eg by baluch groups from central afghanistan and by the baizidi in the region of mahwalat south of turbettiheidari in the last decades these weavers have also used cotton warp threads this change is due to the opening of so far remote areas to modern transportation clever dealers have now the possibility of buying raw wool directly and cheaper from sheep breeding nomads who have succumbed very easily to the temptation of fast money the nomads economic situation has not improved though on the contrary some balouch clans have given up knotting rugs altogether or have at least started to incorporate the cheap foreign material cotton since the use of it does not affect the life of the rugs they have even used it in rugs for their own use up to the middle of this century pileweave and flat weave fabrics were mainly made for home use the demand was never big but at least continuous new pile rugs were part of the customary dowry and served to prove the weaving skills of the bride in addition rugs wore out soon in a balouch tent that does not offer as much protection as a turkoman yurt and thus they had to be replaced more often this also explains why older or even semiantique pieces are rarely found among the balouch themselves during good years a balouch family would weave one or two additional rugs they were sold in the nearest city bazaars or exchanged for utensils that they could not make themselves for tea and sugar as well as for red calico for dresses and once in a while for silver coins for jewelery many balouch from central and north khorassan made those for the persian new year on march st according to our calendar some of them came from far away to the bazaars of meshed therefore the rugs had to be finished by the middle of march corresponding dates were sometimes inscribed into the rugs eg    see fig  also the neighboring iranian villagers then replaced their worn out balouch rugs with newer ones particularly richer people in the villages of djulghe khaf used to cover the floors of their mehmankhane the room where guests were welcomed with nomad rugs a new rug was also needed whenever one was damaged by glowing coals falling from the stove such rugs from the mehmankhane then substituted for worn out rugs in the endetun the living and women quarters which were inaccessible to outsiders the doctor excepted thus only a very limited number of carpets reached the markets in iran and afghanistan that were accessible to european merchants they were not much sought after in the cities because the urban middle class that was able to afford rugs preferred larger sizes but those could not be woven on balouch looms the people in the cities also favored more colorful rugs and if possible floral designs to bring the garden into the house baluch family near quetta circa  photo courtesy baloch circle up until recently there was no big foreign demand for knotted fabrics made by those nomads pile pattern and colors of their rugs did not appeal to the prevailing taste of the first decades of this century even the much more attractive turkoman rugs became popular rather late this explains why in many older but also in some newer books on rugs floral museum carpets are described in detail while baluch rugs are ony mentioned for the sake of completeness popularity for baluch rugs was lacking for more than a hundred years this fact contradicts the idea that the reproduction of turkoman guls and other motifs was caused by foreign demand and respective orders by importers foreign demand and taste have however strongly influenced patterns and color combination of persian manufactured rugs since the middle of the last century at the time when turkoman patterns were knotted in baluch rugs such marketing strategies could not possibly be discussed with nomads who have known how to preserve their independence in every respect until this century all this is surely a reason for the fact that the baluch used natural dyes much longer than many turkoman weavers there were still new baluch rugs without any synthetic dyes until around  at that time chemical wool dyes were already offered in the village bazaars but the were still more expensive than the homemade natural dyes in some pile rugs from those years natural and synthetic dyes were simultaneously used red shades and brown yellows  to imitate camels wool  were soon used on bigger surfaces while yellow and green tints were used only sporadically in some motifs some red and almost all green tones of that period were neither fadeless nor waterproof in the last decade the quality of synthetic dyes however has improved and there have been a greater variety of colors but at the same time the rugs have lost much of their charm unusual colors like crimson red bright orange malachite green and purple seem to have animated the weavers imagination to excessive experiments that were in contrast to tradition the result was disharmony in the rugs this shows that socalled progress can lead to the destruction of good nomad traditionsthe more important traditional colors of the field are found  with exceptions  in the following geographical centers dark blue to black blue made with very concentrated indigo areas of turbettiheidari and kashmir djulghe khaf and the northern part of the herat region medium blue weaker concentration of indigo north khorrassan there are only very few pieces with this color most of them were made in the second half of the last century brick red fire red to dark red made from madder of

substitute for camel wool which has become rare camel wool has always been used mainly for mens clothes black brown natural wool with additional dyes eg walnut shells southern afghanistan eg province of farah in many balouch rugs the ground color in the main borders is the same as the one in the field if the center field is however camel brown red tints are usually used in the borders red borders can also enframe a dark blue field a reverse color combination was not seen in older rugs baluch nomads in seistan se persia photo courtesy baloch circle different shades of ground colors are frequently used for field motifs when red tints are used the design is still discernable but this is not the case when dark blue is used on dark brown like in many very finely knotted saddle bags made by south afghan balouch details in motifs like small petals as well as outlining strips are very often white andor yellow or yellow orange green was used in older carpets only sparingly darker tints are seen in older rugs from sistan and afghanistan up until the beginning of this century lighter blue colors were often found in rugs from central and north khorassan very often motifs were set off with black bordering lines if ihere was not enough black brown sheeps wool available brown wool was dyed several times by boiling it together with steel filings this was done over and over again according to an exactly scheduled process of eight days such a treatment damages the wool it becomes brittle and mouldy but this fact is not considered to lessen the value of the rug those rugs have a relief effect corrosion that makes them very often especially appealing recipes for the production of plant and stone dyes have repeatedly been published but they are only valid for those interviewed in the geographical area of my field studies recipes were jealously kept secret among the families and not revealed even within the clan fig  baluch sistan turkoman ensi borders as a field pattern c

turkoman alternating latchhook pattern as pseudo guls in the field c  doubtful that this truly a sistan region weaving the primary border indicates afghanistan possibly from chakhansur a region of afghanistan bordering se persia  tc kind and size of pile and flatwoven rugs table  are determined by the nomadic way of life and dimensions of the balouch tent its floor is not covered with pile rugs during the day likewise the turkomans do not use pile rugs in their yurts the balouch cover the floors of their tents with dark coarse and mostly unadorned felt mats or tent squares which can no longer be used for the roof they are made of dark goats hair when there were visitors rugs were spread on top of the mats some balouch in the khaf area used their rugs regularly to sleep on when they travelled to market to the doctor etc they took them along as sleeping rugs the sizes that were needed for those purposes were woven most often due to their different functions those rugs cannot be compared to the turkoman odjaq bashi the hearth rug among the tekke turkomans almost square shaped hearth rugs are customary the balouch also made a smaller size rug which is similar to the germetsh or dahanghi the turkoman threshold rug at the entrance to the tent the balouch use this rug for various purposes larger pile rugs are rare and known only from afghanistan and pakistan they are found around herat but mainly in the south near the afghan pakistani border in iranian sistan only flatweave rugs of that size are known with the exception of these large formats the iranian and afghan balouch use about the same size rugs for the same purposes this is also true for the prayer rugs that due to their different size constitute a category of their own some balouch and other above mentioned nomads that have become sedentary also weave runners daliz head pillows balisht with pilewoven fronts are a specific balouch product they are unkown among turkomans their format is similar to small turkoman tent bags torba but they are open at one small side only both small sides can have carefully ornamented webends they are stuffed with raw cotton and then sewn up if the flatwoven back part is lost the original use of these pillows can no longer be identified consequently this very common format has often been incorrectly classified square back pillows poshti with pilewoven fronts are also of the balouch their formats are similar to the big saddle bags they are however more finely knotted and do not have a clasping ledge closure system they are stuffed and then sewn up baluch tribal dress  photo courtesy baloch circle small and big saddle bags khordjin with pilewoven fronts are very common afghan weavers prefer bigger sizes the southern balouch decorate their bags with colorful tassels and shells they find these shells in the deserts of south afghanistan as relics of a former sea most poshti and khordjin are made in pairs with a single warp thread the work is started at the upper end of the knotted front side of the first bag the clasping ledge is added later with loops made of black goats hair then follows a flatwoven part consisting of the back part of the first bag the  cm wide bridge and the back part of the second bag the work is then continued with another pilewoven part for the front of the second bag the weaving is finished at the upper end of the second bag the knotted front sides are then turned over towards the bridge on to their flatwoven back sides and selvaged together this kind of weaving technique causes the pile of the two bags to be oriented in opposite directions in some bags from afghanistan both front pieces are connected over the bridge at their long sides with small knotted strips which continue the pattern of the borders thus the center part of the bridge looks like a window in a pilewoven frame there are also pairs of bags whose back parts are flatwoven with stripe patterns and colorful zigzag designs their bridges are however pilewoven the balouch do not have any big oblong shaped tent bags as are common among turkomans who call them djowalljuval or doshak they neither have knotted spoon comb or mirror cases nor the turkomans ok bashi a protective cap that is pulled over the ends of the bundled up tent poles they make hardly any salt containers which are more frequent among the tshahar chahar aimaq they do make however small pilewoven bags chanteh for multiple use the bags have loops on the back side to pull a belt or a shoulder strap through islamic wandering monks in central and north khorassan used them as purses finally there are the pilewoven gun cases that the balouch made until the beginning of this century they protect the barrel and lock against sandstorms they were sewn together from two equally long strips pile rug fabrics as decoration for use on riding animals are almost limited to saddle blankets festive headgears were rarely made nonnomad balouch used however coarsely knotted strips as harness for donkeys caparisons as seem among yomud turkomans have not been found likewise there are no decorative trappings for wedding camels like djollar asmalyk and diah disluk the balouch bride usually rides a horse only the south afghan beluchi have a headdress for camels it is made of pilewoven strips and upright tassles since a balouch tent does not need tent bands tang nawar yolami nor frames for the entrance kapunuk nor entrance rugs ensikhatshlu tshahar fazl the balouch do not make any of these products only the firuzkuhi who live in yurt like tents make flatwoven tent bands fig  balucj ghainat peacock motif i usually associate the primary border of this piece as belonging to the design pool of the western afghan baluch weavers  tc as pointed out already several observations lead us to assume that the turkomans forced their pileweaving techniques and their patterns on the khorassan balouch further observations in this respect show interesting differences between the turkomans and the balouchs attitude towards the designs in their pile rugs no doubt the turkoman main rug odjaq bash ie the hearth rug still reflects many aspects of religious tradition there are very early animistic shamanistic symbols and later islamic influences the guls sublime the tribal history and represent the transcendental as well as the real world of the turkomans this explains why some turkoman tribes forced the people they had subjugated to give up their own tribal devices in favor of the conquerors that means his gul many tentliving turkomans have held their hearth rug very much in respect until today and it is only used for special occasions the original meaning of these rugs can probably be compared with that of the totems of the north american indians in some respect also to chinese ancestral shrines and to heraldlc emblems in the early history of the occident with the gradual breaking of tribal ties a lot of the original meaning has been lost and the symbols have degenerated to mere ornaments we find the following characteristics of such a degeneration in turkoman rugs  main devices move out of the tribal region so that the reproducer of a gul is no longer identical with its original owner this is also true of tribe specific borders moshkova  shows this development for russian turkestan since   main designs lose their sharpness important details are omitted eg the four flying eagles in the center field of the tekke gul  traditional names for the main devices are replaced by work names ie names of objects which resemble the forms that the weavers have to incorporate in their rugs because it must be done that eg the name ongurghe gul means spine gul for the main device of the ersari dali  in which a close relation to the old ersari timirdjingul is still evident it is obvious that forms and colors have lost some of their richness and it becomes more and more difficult to attribute single motifs to a specific turkoman tribe it has also been forgotten that many motifs originally served as demon charming symbols but in spite of all that todays designs and patterns are still part of a centuriesold tradition chiefs of baluchistan circa  from the living races of mankind new york  the balouchs ethnic origin and their preislamic religious background is not connected in any way with the cradle of the turkic people the altai mountains as a consequence they might have been forced to reproduce turkoman devices in their rugs but that does not necessarily mean that they also understood the symbolic meaning of those motifs therefore we find many turkoman designs modified according to balouch specific taste one that had grown out of a different ethnic background the colors also changed the balouch preferred darker colors so that the europeans called the balouch rugs blue turkomans finally turkoman field motifs were used in the borders of balouch rugs and vice versa for example the turkoman doublet border motif became a field design in balouch rugs made in bidjestan fig  or the turkoman border the famous alternating latchhook pattern became a pseudo gul in the field of balouch rugs from north sistan fig  such inversions of motifs were possible because the turkoman designs were only of decorative meaning to the balouch only the turkoman guls themselves were more or less preserved since the beginning of this century th they have however appeared less the next generations have felt no need to still incorporate them in their rugs if old guls are used they are amazingly exact does that mean that the balouch still respect those turkomans who until the end of the th century undertook alamans fast violent raids starting from the area of serakhs going deep in the south of khorassan on their first contacts with the turkomans the balouch surely became aware of the fact that the turkomans applied their weaving technique to represent patterns with deep symbolic meaning this may have motivated the balouch to use the new technique from their own heritage thus for generations they have reproduced naturalistic profiles of birds like cock and peacock fig  horned quadrupeds capricorn trees of life and two designs that are called in persian botteh and doguli these motifs are not found on turkoman hearth rugs on other pile rug fabrics only among the yomut and beshir and then only in recent times both motifs are however common among all iranian peoples on rugs embroideries potteries and metal crafts some of these peoples still believe in fertility symbols like taus and khorus peacock and cock and a pearshaped motif which strangely enough has been interpreted as palm tree top ball of the thumbprint of turkish conquerors or meanders of a holy indian river fig  in new persian botteh means bush which does not seem to be very meaningful in this context pile rug weavers in east khorassan call this symbol also badam which equals almond since almond trees are very productive this interpretation points again towards fertility even though this name seems to be only a work name fig  baluch region of turbettiheidari botteh allover c  possibly one of the nicest rugs he pictures would be nice to see a colour image of it  tc  the word for gul for the turkoman tribal device is still very often confounded with the persian word gul which means flower those words however do not have anything in common more meaningful seems the relation to gol modern turkish lake old turkish kol kol kul kyl this word appears in connection with many lakes and rivers between the south altai and west turkestan turks in that area held these waters holy according to anochin schmidt  each altaic clan worshipped one of the lakes or rivers as their patron radloff describes the original meaning schmidt  to the southern altaic turks talaikan also yayuk yaik was the master of the fourth world and the patron of the dead but mainly the lord of the seas and all other waters and thus also the master of the sutadkol mythic milk white sea this sea was the source of all life forces the yayutsi drew from it the soul for each individual beginning of life and accompanied the individual through his whole life as his tutelary powers schmidt  harva  reports about the sytkulamine the milk sea goddess a goddess of buryat later op cit  he mentions the two mythologic birds oksokokyl and kaikyl as companions of the shamanist soul on its way to the transcendent world according to this turkoman guls represented symbols reminding of the original life force of the respective paternal tribal soul they had a protective meaning to all descendants the abstract designs of totem birds and sacrificial animals make that interpretation very probable the lacking identity of persian gul with turkoman gul is finally proven by the ersari guligol part  go to part   part   part   part  illus  key to the mah moon motif illus  typical vase motif of the sistan balouch time and place of origin of a series of other designs cannot be identified these designs are popular everywhere between china and mesopotamia and they reflect early religious ideas which different ethnic groups had in common for example symbols were used to invoke the cosmological order rain at the wrong time floods and droughts disrupted this order and were the work of bad demons to these early hunters plantgatherers and cattleraising nomads in their view of life the moon was an important principle of order its regular reappearance allowed the division of time its disappearance meant rain in some areas but its significance in connection with the female fertility cycle was even more important this is not the place to dwell on the early moon symbolism it is however still important and moon symbols have always been used and are still being used on rugs like on the balouch rug from the area of ferdows the two phased moon is shown three times ill  twentyfive years ago only some very old balouch weavers and the djulghe khaf were able to associate these patterns with the moon female fertility has long been invoked through lozenge andor triangle patterns male fertility through fish designs these mythical symbols or their combination into one motif reach far east into the china of the shang and han periods hentze  buckens  and west to sumer parrot  and  they appear as cryptograms on findings from mohendjo daro kinnier wilson  and are finally found among scythians in south russia and in the altai talbot rice  and others in order for the clan to survive there have to be many descendants this explains whythe fertility motifs are still in use in central asia fish and lozenge motifs are not only found on copper and ceramic receptacles of the sedentary population but are also reproduced by steppe nomads in whose environment there are hardly any fish tekke and yomud turkomans use these motifs in womens jewelry andmore abstractin rugs too also balouch rugs show lozenge and fish sometimes even as a motif combination the fish is stylized into the sawteeth pattern which is the most important part of the keshmiri design that has been used by around turbettiheidari and in afghanistan todays weavers cannot associate anything with the name keshmiri it seems to have originated in the east old balouch women among the saidmohammadkhani baluch related this motif to the taifa the clan and thought it important the complete keshmiri consists of four fish that are arranged around a lozenge a possible interpretation is male fertility fish plus female fertility lozenge lead to descendants which means immortality of the clan for more than  years the keshmiri pattern of the khorassan balouch has been used also under the name of herati on rugs manufactured in feraghan west persia the name herati points also to an eastern origin it is not clear whether both names have a common provenance or whether the weavers adopted the name from each other this is by the way the only design to which the balouch attach holy spheres and sacrificial animals i will come back to that later the keshmiri pattern could not be found on really old rugs neither among khorassan balouch nor in feraghan fig  balouch region of ferdows mah and nimmah motif c  an example of arab baluch tribal weaving the field pattern as well as the primary border motif are distinctive features of weavings from this tribal grouptc the balouch have also applied motifs that stem from islamic symbolism a hand is very often represented in the upper corner of the akhundi prayer rug this motif is widely used in the arabislamic world it is the hand of fatimah a protection against the evil eye most of the balouch weavers belong to the sunni and they call this motif pandjeh ie five meaning five fundamental principles it is implausible that the design serves as an indication for the positioning of the hands and often heard explanation in the nonislamic world since the prayer knows this from childhood on anyway other islamic motifs are very rare in spite of an early islamization animistic elements have survived they originate in old iranian beliefs which are also at the root of the khorassan baluchs concept of the omnipresence of evil gods and demons like djin pari and div gafferbergs studies  on the sistan baluch who immigrated into the turkmen ssr during this century show many parallels to donaldsons description  of folk belief in khorassan and brays study  on the brhui turkoman or early turkish beliefs seem to have influenced those baluch to a lesser degree very soon purely decorative elements from other traditions were added to the already existing multitude of symbols little flowers were scattered all over as were simple crosses and other small figures all these different style elements may be incorporated in a single rug which seems to have appealed to the european aesthetic feeling the composition and the assimilation of the different motifs were completed by the middle of the th century even though balouch weavers have usually kept to their traditional patterns they have sometimes developed new combinations the gharai balouch in petro provide many examples for that new variations and creations however seldom survive one generation because they are the individual weavers literary property only it is therefore very difficult to classify such rugs the balouchs ability to weave completely new designs shows their creativity and proves that their pile rugs to not have cultic meaning in order to attribute certain patterns to certain areas of production it is necessaryaccording to the above explanationsthat the patterns meet the following characteristics  they must be more than simple ubiquitous ornaments  they must have survived several generations within the same balouch group  they must have been reproduced in rugs for personal use not only on main rugs but also on other pilewoven fabrics patterns that meet the above criteria may change their outer form with time or may be arranged differently within the composition of design such modifications remain insignificant as long as the characteristics of the motif are definitely identifiable this for example applies to the keshiri pattern fig  fig  balouch nw afghanistan tekke turkoman ghorbaghe gul on prayer rug c  whether this is actually a prayer rug is debateable possibly wegner is looking at the colour change in the border which seem to designate an arch theories concerning latent prayer rugs see baluch prayer rugs adraskand are something less than commonly accepted and apparently undocumented in the original text of the article there is reference to the diamond shaped form in the field adjacent to the lower border as designating the spot where someone would touch their forehead in prayer either way i beleive he is sadly mistaken as there is no way that this is a prayer rug tc a summary of the most important patterns and their occurrence in specific regions follows first i will discuss turkoman patterns that have only slightly changed or not at all turkoman tribal guls and secondary patterns it is surprising that octagons with the mar gul of the salor dominate in the north khorassan down to the region of ghain on either side of the iranianafghan border these octagons have clanspecific center parts which are too most often of turkoman origin tekke guls are very rare in this part of khorassan they are however almost exclusively used south of ghain there they are reproduced amazingly precisely only the proportions of the octagon are changed into a squarelike figure this change is seen in most mar guls too a rather numerous group of weavers around zabol usesbesides the tribal or main tekke gula secondary gul which is most often seen among the mervtekke it is the ghorbaghe or frog gul the other traditional secondary gul used by akhaltekke and the yomud is the tshemtshe or spoon gul it does not appear together with the tekke gul in balouch rugs from zabol nor anywhere else in north khorassan the ghorbaghe gul can become the primary motif in the field fig  on rugs showing the primary tekke gul the secondary frog gul can be substituted by a small vase from which a trefoil rises between two petioles on either side ill  this nonturkoman motif is found on zabol balouch rugs together with other designs and is characteristic of that region see fig  some pieces show both secondary designs frog and vase side by side most main and minor borders have patterns of the turkoman origin for example the volute cross is a heraldic square kotshanak aine which the tekke and the salor use as a field design in some of the rugs the guls are arranged in three vertical rows with seven or nine guls in each row this is clearly a tekke tradition the tekke tradition is less obvious in the colors aubergine tints in the field green and gold orange shades in the borders and in the secondary guls are characteristic of the zaboltekke this color combination discriminates their products from those made by the mahdadkhani balouch who lived around nehbandan at the eastern edge of the southern lut desert in  illus  gulliekaf of the boruti these balouch reproduce the tekke gul and the ghobaghe secondary gul very accurately but without vase motif and with turkoman colors ie red ground color and no zabol green fig  tekke influence can also be seen in the borders and in pilewoven herringbone stripes on the webends there are never more than two vertical rows of guls and four or six guls per row are most common the tekke influence diminishes from sistan toward the east it was still evident in a rug made by balouch in  who lived as nomads south of the afghan city of shindand sabzewar in  fig  once in a while the tekke gul can be seen on pieces from central and north khorassan but only one small group of halfsedentary weavers in the area of tsheshmegul a mountain village at the northern edge of the djulghe djam not far from turbettiisheikhidjam reproduced the tekke gul exactly these weavers who live in balouch type tents were not sure of their balouch origin denying however any relation to turkomans or the neighboring timuri they have made gul rugs with balouch structures for generations but have applied tekke designs for all other details at the same time eg on borders tekke guls are also used in prayer rugs with a horizontal top line of the mihrab it is interesting that not even old damaged pieces were for sale not even at exaggerated prices another turkoman pattern used by these weavers will be discussed later more or less distinct tekke guls are also found among the rahimkhani near serakhs among the gharai balouch in petro and among some bahluri clans in the djulghe khaf at the same time these groups use variants of the mar gul fig  the mar gul seems to be of more importance in this part of khorassan because even the tekke gul is enframed by an octagon figure which is unmistakably derived from the mar gul keshmiri patterns are also used in this region occasionally between tribal guls or as secondary guls see fig  fig  mahdadkhani balouch nehbandan tekke tribal gul and secondary gul chemche c  fig  balouch west afghanistan deformed tekke gul c  variants of the mar guls have frequently been appliedwithout claims to completenessby the

ghain bidokht the central shields in the main guls are probably peculiar to each group or clan where there are two rows of guls across the field the designs in the two rows between them are probably also specific to a group of weavers eg the rugs of the gharai balouch they reproduce the typical stepped cross not only in their gul rugs but also in the rugs of the keshmiri pattern details within the cross possibly distinguish individual weavers main and minor borders also help identify the groupof weavers the border designs also help identify the group of weavers the border designs seem to occur always in combination with a particular field variant tribal guls from the ersari were either never reproduced by the beluchi or have disappeared from their collection of patterns for example as among the afghan balouch however north of herat tauk guls were found in balouch rugs this points to contacts with the tshubbash turkomans who are of chaudori origin fig  between nishapur and meshed and in the djulghe djam the tekkesalor volute cross kotshanak aine is very often part of field patterns the volute form was originally only fillin motif inside the latticework of the field it was used on small turkoman rugs and bags it also fills the latticework of the secondand more popularfield pattern of the tsheshmegul weavers this motif is also common in multiple field rugs three or

composition deserved special attention fig  it is found in the region of kashmar but mainly in an area east of a line from meshed to turbettiheidari to gounabad and across to central afghanistan it is reproduced in a multitude of varieties not only by balouch but also by groups of timuri moreidari and bahluri the motif has undergone many changes to the point where it became a mere ornament wegner   in older pieces the balouch repeated the keshmiri in only one vertical row later namely since the first decades of this century has the motif been arranged in two or more rows and incorporated in a

apprehension of its meaning on the khoshabi rugs the four fish merge into a lozenge figure fig  in the sarbuzi design the field is divided into up to five pairs of strong transversal bars the fish in between them at times deformed into triangular shapes are quasirepelled by their lozenge so that the motif is practically dissolved fig  fig  timuri djulghe djam c  fig  saidmohammadkhani balouch djulghe khaf keshmiri pattern c  fig  bahluri region of ghurian keshmiri pattern around  part  go to part   part   part   part  the keshmiri motif has been used for several generations by sixteen different balouch groups in a rather large area this shows that it has been passed on to at least twelve neighboring groups of weavers who are of different ethnic origin these weavers attempts to make the keshmiri pattern their own led sometimes to formal alienations they did not however try to adopt other typical balouch designs like doguli botteh or hashiejenarges narcissus border this illustrates that it was hardly imitative instinct only that caused the spreading of the keshmiri motif the fate of a subordinate motif shows how intensively some secondary weavers studied the keshmiri pattern this subordinate motif iswith little modificationon all keshmiri rugs made by balouch but also often on those made by the secondary weavers its contours resemble a step pyramid with a platform on top an elevatedsometimes multiplesymbol of horns on a pedestal is shown on a white ground occasionally also horned quadrupeds see fig  according to information by balouch this design represents sacred places an abstraction of places of sacrifice it is reproduced either in each corner of the center field or two times mostly three times sometimes five times along the innermost border of the small sides or more seldom of the small sides and the long sides see fig  the bahluri in the border area of khafghurian up to tayabad developed this motif into another field design which is typical of them they combine four motifs to form a central cross and repeat this figure several times see wegner  fig  or wegner  fig  it is interesting to note that the keshmiri motif does not occur anywhere outside a wide zone that starts in the west region of kashmar goes east via turbettiheidari to the mountain valleys of turbettisheikidjam djulghe djam bakharz and khaf and further into central west afghanistan therefore the keshmiri is characteristic of this zone the doguli meaning two flowers motif is another typical balouch design two different floral motifs alternate over the central field checkerboardlike it is often used as a traditional motif mainly among the following balouch  sultan khani north of kashmar kuhekhab  abdulsorkhi anabad region of kashmar  taheri kelatefoulat region of kashmar  tshubdari south of kashmar down to bidjestan  djanbeghi between khaf and the afghan border fig  salarkhani balouch djulghe khaf keshmiri pattern c  fig  saidmohammadkhani balouch djulghe khaf keshmiri pattern c  all the patterns of the kashmar region show an additional small and always white star shaped floral ornament between the brown and dark to medium red flowers on the black blue field fig  among the sultankhani this additional ornament has mostly five elongated leaves the tshubdari use two four or six more rectangular leaves both have at least one minor border with unusually high latchhooks the main borders differ again in the tshubkari rugs the ground color of the border is often the same as that of the field in any case dark the favored alternating latchhook pattern turkoman line is only recognizable at a closer look these rugs look somber and dull in comparison to those made by the sultankhani in which the red of one of the floral motifs corresponds with the ground color of the main border the djanbeghi who live  km further east use differently formed flowers which are typical of them fig  in older rugs made by the boruti one single floral motif alternates its color checkerboardlike the boruti live in small and very scattered clans between salame in the eastern khaf valley and central afghanistan they do not consider themselves balouch and probably belong to the timuri the boruti use the floral motif gulekhaf ill  in their rather rare pile rugs it appears more often in the main borders of medium sized saddle bags which are made in western afghanistan south of herat wegner  fig  fig  khoshabibahluri djulghe khaf keshmiri variant fig  sarbuzitimuri djulghekhaf keshmiri variant c  since the middle of this century this motif has been seen on boruti rugs also in diagonal arrangement the same pattern is repeated in the same color along diagonal rows diagonal rows are another very popular pattern in the center field of balouch rugs geometrical figures fill the lozenge hexagon or octagon lattice this arrangement and these figures are unknown in turkoman rugs fig   and  show three of the most common patterns ill a and b two others the gulekhat motif of the boruti has already been mentioned the patterns vary a little according to time and place of production pattern variants cannot be attributed to particular weavers in the first half of this century the ali akbarkhani balouch from the area of fazelman used two different patterns simultaneously nothing could be found out about the original symbolic meaning of these motifs if none of the older women of a clanthe ones that preserve the traditioncould remember the meaning of the patterns the usual unfortunately frequent answer was adat hast ie this is customary this is the proper way diagonal rows are found in the area of turbettiheidari then west to the region of kashmar and south across mahwalat where they were especially popular into ghainat where they were still used frequently at the turn of this century ill c and furthernow getting rarerto sistan east of turbett diagonal rows were seen on rugs from the djulghe khaf and djulghe bakjarz and with decreasing frequency up to afghan badghiz they were neither found north of meshed and nishapur nor in the regions of ferdows and bidjestan they were used by balouch as well as by groups of timuri it seems as if the timuri wove more complicated motifs see fig  and  the following groups of weavers could be identified  aliakbarkhani balouch fazelman djulghe khaf  abdulsorkhi balouch kuhekhab kashmar   several clans balouch mahwalat turbettiheida   several clans balouch around ghain ghainat   several clans balouch  sistan  boruti timuri salame djulghe khaf  moreidari timuri abbasabad pain djulghe khaf   several clans timuri  djulghe bakharz figure  balouchmahwalat diagonal rows lozenge lattice c   in east and southeast iran and afghanistan there are still today sacred places from preislamic time they are marked with a pole on top of which there is a horned skull of a ram this elevated skull can presumably be viewed as pars pro toto of the animal that was to be sacrificed maybe the stepped form in these rugs represent a holy  mountain during islamization these holy places became muhammedan holy tombs eg the mountain in sistan which contained many sacred artifacts from a prehistoric period became the kuhikhwadja mountain of the venerable islamic priest fig  abdulsorkhi balouch region of kashmar dogüli pattern c  fig  djanbeghi balouch djughe khaf dogüli pattern c  the allover pattern or infinite rapport needs to be presented next it is a field pattern closely related to the diagonal rows it shows among others the same geometrical motifs but does not emphasize the diagonals through colors it may occur within a latticework which consists mainly of squares those may be filled with turkoman kotshanak aine as in the rugs made in tsheshmegul besides the volute cross there is a wide variety of partly rather complicated motifs some of which were reproduced for generations fig  shows such an old motif on a badghiz  balouch rug from the last third of the th century another one is the botteh motif fig  furthermore there is the lozenge with attached latchhooks european work name tarantula and a motif that resembles the turkoman ashik but its outlines seem changed and elongated vertically ill  the three last mentioned motifs can also be independent figures without lattice in the botteh or badam motif a division of the field is obtained by orienting its points to the left of one horizontal row and to the right in the next one also the vegetallooking motifs of the dokhtareghazi need to be mentioned presumably they are very abstract animal symbols fig  and  soon after the beginning of this century mere ornamentsas fillings in the latticework or by themselvesappeared in addition to the elaborate motifs in the early stages of this development there were still figures as shown in fig    the outlines of stars stepped polygons flowers or cruciforms represent motifs that are divided each into eight parts remembering the significance of the number eight and its representation through octagons in turkoman tribal guls we can assume that we are dealing here with a deformation of an important symbol into a pure decorative ornament we do not know anything about a meaning of the number eight in preislamic time if there was one it might have merged into the islamic interpretation according to this  symbolizes the omnipresence of god that is in all four directions and the areas between them and represents the prayer for divine protection everywhere a very dense arrangement of small hardly differentiated ornamentsamong them botteh each  cm highcreate the impression as if flowers were strewn all over the center field this reflects the weavers horror vacuii who no longer have a true relation to the designs they reproduce fig  aliakbarkhani balouch djulghe khaf diagonal rows octagon lattice c  fig  balouchmahwalat diagonal rows lozenge lattice c  at the time of my field studies it was almost impossible to attribute the multitude of allover variants to certain regions the following classification lists these groups of weavers that used allover pattenrs besides other patterns  alizai balouch  region of ghurian  x  star filled small octagon no lattice  asgharzai balouch dehanshur djulghe khaf a narrow lattice with stars b botteh direction of their points

reticulate lattice  name unknown balouch ghainat figures similar to spools of thread  tabissi balouch azizabad kashmar botteh strewn flowers fig  timuri djulghe khaf güemoreidari in diagonal rows hexagon lattice c  fig  balouch badghiz allover pattern c  a cautious determination of origin is somewhat easier for rugs that have medallions in the center field steppedindented polygons have already been mentioned they were adopted from southeast persian afshar turkomans some rugs made by fathollahi balouch have also an unmistakably afshar main border even the knotting structure can be similar to one of afshar products only the mentioned vases ill  and other small field motifs that are exclusively used by sistan balouch point to the real producers see fig  and  one should think that this mixture of designs occurred mainly in south khorassan and in western sistan where a close contact and even intermarriage encouraged the adoption of afshar designs obviously this did not however happen very often the northern edge of this contact zone is assumed to be in the area of gounabad bidokht lies south already in the northern ghainat where balouch made finely knotted prayer rugs that show two stepped polygons with white outlines one above the other in an auberginecolored field illus a motif of the aliakbarkhani in diagonal hexagon lattice illus  baluch motif ghanat ashik deformation part  go to part   part   part   part  rugs of rather coarse structure are found in darbaz southern ghainat these rugs have three or four large lozenges in the field three or more boldly designed parallels emerge from each lozenge in both directions the whole design reminds of shirwan rugs like eiland  illustrates them on plate  these pieces are however made by arabzadeh clans of whose history no details could be found out the reproduction of three or four mah polygons in the field has to be viewed as an original pattern of a balouch clan from the region of ferdows there is no afshar influence see fig  the above regional classification of the groups of weavers and their characteristic patterns is rather reliable as an example of how much caution is required in determining the origin of rugs a rug will be presented in fig  that has an unmistakably afshar medallion and an afshar format the knotting structure points however to balouch weavers the rug was indeed made by a small group of sheepraising balouch who had lived at the oasis of torogh near meshed  for two generations until  nothing has been found out about their present whereabouts fig  dokhtareghazi baluch nw afghanistan all over pattern around  the pattern while associated with a group of weavings known by this name can hardly be used as means to identify these weavers doktoriqazi weavings thought to be timuri are much finer than this more rustic example from afghanistan tc fig  gharai baluch djudghe khaf eight leafed flower in polygon lattice around  the karai of torbat heydari excraycraft  tc at the time of this research work there were not to be foundneither onsite nor in the bazaars of meshed turbettiheidari and kashmarany rugs with field designs of the medallion kind from the regions of bidjestan kashmar mahwalat turbettiheidari djulghe khaf and djulghe rokh in the greater region of nishapure were produced however rugs with single rows of three or four squares see fig  besides those they show three or four large sometimes bizarre figures with attached latchhooks they are arranged above each other in the field see black  table  the earlier mentioned multiple field rugs see fig  originate however mostly in the areas north of meshed and in the djulghe djam the moreidari from the djulghe bakharz weave center fields with one single row of lozenges which stretch and have attached latchhooksvery similar arranged lozenges but with a greater number of more elaborate details seem to be typical of the kuduani in djaffergegh northeast afghanistan janata  ii and oral information lists the kuduani among the timuri subtribes a very impressive design in rather finely knotted rugs is attributed to the neighboring mushawani see fig  the colorfulness of their rugs is striking because it is unusual in this area among other colors medium blue brick red and russian green are used without them clashing the rounding of the hooks almost into spirals is also typical these weavers ethnic origin is controversial today they consider themselves balouch rather than afghan pathans like they used to illus b baluch motif region of nishapur in lozenge lattice a classic element reminiscent of an older turkic aesthetic een only in the khorassan baluch weavings note the  animal forms opposed to one another with in the medallion tc illus c baluch motif ghanat in lozen lattice this motif occurs in weavings throughout the baluch weaving world and beyond a classic turkic motif not associated with any particular group or region  tc in the same region an apparently rather similar pattern is used by maududi one of the important subtribes of the djamshidi janata   and oral information the ethnic origin of still another group of weavers is very much in question their pattern which is found in quite a big area consists of a sometimes irregular composition of different figures with diameters up to  cm when repeated the figures are not always of the same size some of them remind us of big flowers on old manufactured rugs from herat and khorassan others of cartouches on a trapezoid base or of the allover pattern as in fig  but sometimes the teeth and hooks seem to be mere imaginary forms the prevailing colors are dark blue dark brown and dark red thus these rugs that are also made in bigger sizes give an overall dark impression see thatcher  table  mccoy  table eiland  color plate xi and black  table  the two first mentioned authors assign these rugs to balouch in adreskand southeast of herat eiland attributes them to the mushawani north of herat and black mentions a subtribe of the durani wegner   therefore we cannot exclude that the adreskand rugs were made by several neighboring groups of different ethnogenesis another example for the deformation of floral designs originally seen in persian carpets but changed into geometrical and sometimes bizarre alienated ornaments can be found with the kotlu nomads these are a subtribe of the afshar turkomans and live south of kirmauas mentioned before a pattern has to be applied on pileweave products of different formats and for various uses before it can be regarded as traditional and important thus almost all the patterns that were presented in this article could be identified as prayer rugs too prayer rugs are recognized by the mihrab the prayerniche on one small side of the rug that makes the center field asymmetrical there are also traditional patterns that are used on prayer rugs only the ensuing diversity of patterns would still have to be described in detail this is not possible within the scope of this paper therefore only one prayer rug with typical field design was presented fig  it needs to be mentioned however that there are also prayer rugs without mihrab among balouch and their nonturkoman neighbors rugs with a tree of life or a variant of itnot necessarily on a camelcolored or white groundbelong under this rubric also other features can make a rug a definite dja namez ie place for praying the rug shown in fig  belongs in this category it has the little octagon at one small side just inside the field marking the place where the praying persons forehead touches the ground it has sharply defined color changes in the border at the other small end of the rug giving the impression of a baseboard fig  dokhtareghazi baluch nw afghanistan overall patten circa  a real stretch attributing this weaving to the same group in fig  based upon a slight resemblance in field elements tc fig  baluch nw afghanistan eight pointed star as field pattern around  it also needs to be pointed out that the multitude of border designs could not be discussed here patterns that were found in a bigger geographical area could often only be assigned to certain weavers andor a certain province on the grounds of their combination with certain border patterns at the end of these discussions it is essential to recall to mind once more that results from onsite research obtained already between  and  were used since then nomads have become sedentary or at least semisedentary hardly accessible places and regions have been opened up by roads demand and supply of foreign markets have reached formerly selfsufficient areas and subsequently changed their political social and economic structure thus it may be difficult today to find all the above mentioned groups of weavers in the same regions and under the same names that they were formerly proud of therefore this article is meant to incite new field studies future studies need to confirm correct and mainly complement previous findings so that we can deepen our knowledge about the balouch the pile rugs of these fascinating people are a remarkable example of how the balouch have developed a truly independent textile representation of their material culture in spite of repeated absorption of foreign ethnic elements and under constant and considerable pressure from hostile neighbors may the balouch be able to keep their tradition and culture in the future fig  timuri region of zurhabad eight leafed cross on prayer rug i have never heard anyone else attribute these prayer rugs to the timuri presumably it is a camel ground fieldtc fig  baluch torogh near meshhed afshar medallion and eight leafed flowers circa  would be nice to know the structure of this piece whether it has an asymmetric knot open left or right which would assist with proper attribution tc access to publications by russian ethnographers is often difficult because of language reasons the translations of part of gafferbergs work from  and of his complete publication from  are therefore very valuable i thank dr med irmgard wegner for them i am also very much obliged to her for lending
