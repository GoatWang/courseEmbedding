in a few hours now ill turn the call over to frank for his opening remarks frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director good afternoon and thank you for joining us for zyngas q earnings call earlier today we released our quarterly earnings letter which details our progress and performance over the last quarter its been a productive two months leading zynga as ceo across the company i am seeing our momentum and pace improve as our teams continue their commitment to growing our established live franchises and demonstrating more cost and operating discipline as a result we delivered a strong q and a good start to the year in terms of our q performance bookings were above the high end of our guidance range at  million and adjusted ebitda was above our range at  million there were three key factors that drove the outperformance first in live game services our teams executed well with our core mobile franchises driving our performance in the quarter bookings are up  from last year and up  sequentially second our mobile momentum continued with mobile bookings now representing  of total bookings and mobile audience up  sequentially apple is now our largest platform partner surpassing facebook in terms of online game bookings third disciplined cost control remains a focus for us this past quarter gross margins benefited from our migration to aws and operating margins were further boosted as operating expenses decreased as a percentage of bookings before turning to guidance id like to tell you more about where we want to take the company my priority is to bring zyngas unique social gaming vision to life in our games and lead our teams to deliver highquality experiences for our players on time and profitably in a competitive mobile market with increasing user acquisition costs our approach is to build games around social features and systems to deliver a highquality player experience with increased levels of engagement organic acquisition and longterm retention in order to deliver on that were building a worldclass studio and innovative creative culture in my experience the best games in the world are made by small complete teams with great chemistry who build games in a predictable and profitable way well be aggressive in bringing in additional creative talent and leadership while maintaining our financial discipline the biggest surprise to me since joining zynga has been how much operating leverage we have across the company that we are just starting to unlock we need to do more to concentrate our best and brightest on our biggest ideas there is an opportunity to create more rigorous and consistent development practices across our studios that includes more focused greenlight process increasing crossteam collaboration to cut down on duplication and rising the bar on roi for our new product starts and marketing spends we believe that over the long term there is no reason why zyngas margins cant be more in line with its peers an example of how weve unlocked this operating leverage in our live services is in our words with friends franchise words with friends just had its highest q bookings performance in six years with mobile bookings up  yearoveryear driven by our weekly challenges bold beat a key component of our words with friends live service strength is our advertising business overall advertising and other bookings grew  yearoveryear generating  million in the quarter were confident that going forward we can continue to grow our core live mobile franchises slots words with friends and zynga poker turning to guidance we expect q bookings to be in the range of  million to  million the majority of the sequential decline in bookings is due to legacy noncore mobile games and continued decline in web games we expect adjusted ebitda to be between breakeven and positive  million the sequence decline – the sequential decline in ebitda is expected to be driven by the decrease in bookings that – as were planning to hold nongaap operating expenses roughly flat looking at our slate we remain on track to launch  games this year so far weve launched four new games worldwide and the remaining titles in our  slate are all currently in soft launch with players for naturalmotion im pleased to announce that we will be launching csr in early q and dawn of titans in the q holiday season for dawn of titans the feedback from soft launch is that our players are excited with the games quality and production values we plan to focus the remaining time and development to increase longterm player retention and optimize the game for live services postlaunch going forward were prioritizing quality over quantity in terms of our title release schedule because our goal is to deliver sustainable gains that engage over the long term and drive growth across audience bookings and ebitda our success will be determined by the quality of the games delivered rather than a number of games launched in closing i believe that zynga has all the ingredients needed for a successful turnaround and its well underway from our social vision to our proven brands and popular genres to our mobile momentum and strong balance sheet we are well positioned to take advantage of the growing market around us with that id like to turn the call over to the operator and get started with questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of brian pitz with jefferies your line is open please go ahead brian j pitz  jefferies llc thanks for the questions frank maybe you could outline your strategic vision for the company and what may be different or changed under your leadership also maybe you could weave into there any comments – additional comments on naturalmotion leveraging some of those other game engines or assets embedded in there and then finally any thoughts on monetizing the san francisco real estate asset i know there was some talk in the papers a few months back but love to get your current take on that thanks frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director yeah thank you for the question id like to start with the vision that we are looking at and as you look at zynga as a company and where it was founded around the idea that its more fun to play games with friends and family and to build games around the notion that you create core loops in systems that create a social experience from the outset thats a unique vision that i think is as relevant today on mobile as it was when it was originally brought to life in facebook so the founding principles of the company are based on social gaming and bringing that gaming vision to life in our products is really job one and what we are focused on these early stages what i bring to the table i think is over the last two years i was running basically a mobile division at a company and im steeped in what works and doesnt work in mobile and bringing that insight and some of that experience to bear at zynga i think can help accelerate the transition to mobile and then start to grow the company accordingly when i look at what we have inside the company from an asset standpoint weve got a collection of proven brands in very popular genres weve got some talented studio teams and partner teams an excellent balance sheet but what we havent been really doing a great job at is operationally bringing those to life as i walk around the company i see more great ideas on the white boards than anywhere else ive been but my job is to get it off the white boards and into code and to focus our efforts so that we can get into a place where the company is really delivering on what it says it wants to do and grow  the kpis that will make the company something that increases in value over time the second question about naturalmotion naturalmotion is an incredible collection of developers they have some amazing technologies and if you look at dawn of titans it looks like a console game on your mobile device its a spectacular piece of software and i think longterm naturalmotion has a lot to contribute to zynga as the devices and the mobile market continue to increase in power in capability and new technologies come online like vr and ar i think the key for naturalmotion is really delivering on csr and dawn of titans in the near term and getting them in position for the long term so that zynga overall benefits from the asset in terms of the building its kind of a highclass problem we have an asset here in san francisco that we bought for very good price and its gotten a lot more valuable over the years as san francisco real estate markets got – has become more vibrant its really an opportunistic exploration honestly its not much of a distraction for the company or the teams because we have plenty of cash on the balance sheet its really about is this a good time to investigate taking some of that value that weve created in the building and taking it off the table and see if we could look to deploy it in a different way in capital allocation brian j pitz  jefferies llc great thanks for the color operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of eric sheridan with ubs your line is open please go ahead eric j sheridan  ubs securities llc great thanks for taking the question i wanted to come back to some of the key titles for later this year csr dawn of titans dawn of titans in particular has been in beta for a quite a while what have you learned as those properties have made their way through geolock  what do you think youre hoping to accomplish before they go wider and maybe some color on how youre thinking about supporting those properties with marketing spend in the back part of the year thanks so much frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director when you look at csr and dawn of titans theyre operating at the very highest ends of performance in the mobile marketplace they really are pushing the envelope in terms of d graphics production values and technology so theyve really carved out a position i believe in the marketplace that stands out that people really like and thats reflected in the feedback that were getting from soft launch our fans are giving the games very high ratings csr in its current  test markets is scoring about a  star level dawn of titans is at a  level whats been critical for naturalmotion in the soft launch periods and what they learned the most has been about driving longterm engagement with our players and understanding retention both games have very good levels of if not great levels of monetization the key is keeping the players in the games for long periods of time what im trying to drive at the company is get to a place where we have sustainable mobile games games that dont get into the charts and then fall out but actually get into the charts and stick and i think thats the big difference maker between the games that are succeeding in mobile and the games that are failing in mobile is that theyve solved for longterm engagement so as you look at the time that we have between now and the release around dawn of titans this holiday our focus is really getting the games ready for live ops and there is a lot of things that zynga has learned over the years about how to run live ops that naturalmotion is learning from and that were putting into place and in addition were optimizing the player retention curves and looking at how we keep them engaged for as long as possible its pretty expensive to acquire customers in mobile and so you want to have designs and systems that keep them engaged for a very long time so you can hold on to them both products will be supported by the company and what i am excited about with dawn of titans in q is the holiday is a terrific time to really leverage a lot of the organic platforms and programs that we can put in place a lot of new devices are brought to market in that timeframe too so ive had pretty good experience bringing games to market in holidays and so im excited to try and leverage that eric j sheridan  ubs securities llc thank you joo mi kim  senior director of finance and investor relations zyinga inc great were ready for our next question operator your next question comes from the line of chris merwin with barclays your line is open please go ahead chris merwin  barclays capital inc great thank you so i just had a couple of questions frank you talked about the potential for operating leverage at zynga and the longterm margin opportunity for the business so just curious what you see as the biggest areas of savings and if those savings can be achieved with the workforce at its current size and then just a second question on the advertising business where you guys have showed some strong momentum for a while now the question is really when you layer in ad especially rewardbased ads how do you make sure that theyre not cannibalizing a potential payer in other words if someone gets another life by watching an ad will they maybe not be inclined to pay in the future so just kind of curious how youre able to leverage your data asset to manage that thanks frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director sure ill take the second question first if thats all right one of the things that was really impressive to me when i came to zynga was the quality the aggressiveness and the effectiveness of the ad business here and the team that runs that is very datadriven so theyre constantly looking at how the ads are running in games we have a very robust set of rules about who sees ads when and we monitor that very carefully as we look at engagement and ratings about the games quality and engagement and retention curve so im very confident that the team has a good handle on that and its a combination of data driven best practices as well as just frankly always keeping in mind that advertising wants to be something that doesnt get in the way of the player experience and as understood in the context of the overall game service in terms of the first question the operating leverage piece i think across the board we can get more yield out of what weve got and so thats kind of job one for me as i look at the company if you just take marketing spends for example i think that we need to raise expectations around what our rois are there i think we can get more leverage and we can open more channels by being more aggressive about looking at things internationally looking at what our return on spends are and increasing the capabilities in our user acquisition teams on the studio level its a great collection of game companies that come into zynga over the years but – and i think there is an opportunity to harmonize our tech strategy our tool strategy i find that game teams are solving the same problems across the studio multiple times and what id love to see is an innovation or a breakthrough that happens on one team be more easily shared across the whole enterprise so that we benefit from that and we get more leverage so as we start to put in place more rigorous and consistent development practices combined with looking at enhancing our ua capabilities i think well get some really good leverage from those areas another place that i think well get leverage is frankly being more rigorous about what we greenlight and start a company can only have so much talent and i think theres been a tendency at times in zyngas history to start too many projects and spread that talent to thinly and so i think that there is a lot of opportunity for us to concentrate our efforts and our focus around the frankly the businesses that are really showing growth have momentum and get out of businesses that dont have that opportunity or dont have that ultimate go much sooner in development so again youve heard me talk a little bit earlier about the words with friends example but that game team doubling down on bold beat around the weekly challenges had a profound impact on how the live services were going and that was the business we already had scale in we already had a large audience we were able to use that development to reacquire users and bring them back into words with friends in a very efficient way and in a very leveraged way and i see examples of that in our social casino business and were starting to do that more in our ville business so across the board i see a lot of leverage opportunities chris merwin  barclays capital inc all right great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of colin sebastian with robert baird your line is open please go ahead colin a sebastian  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thanks a couple of followups to other questions i guess first off on the operating leverage commentary frank from the letter and marketing expense can you talk about whether – or how much of that is making better use of the overall network of users that you have and if youre also reallocating spend to better performing channels what are those and then on the advertising revenue portion obviously very good growth there i wonder if you could identify how much of that is related to sponsored play versus the partnership with rubicon or the legacy ad business thank you frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director so on the question regarding ua efficiencies i think there are some very innovative new channels that were looking at that were starting to open up and the team has – i think theres probably  channels when i look at ua that have the opportunity to get leverage id have to say were probably only in  to  of those and i think so we can expand the number of channels that were going after aggressively i think its also related to upgrading and enhancing the technology that we have around crosspromotion in network i think we have a very robust and highly engaged network of users but the way that we get the right message to the right customer at the right time i think has a lot of opportunity to be enhanced we do a pretty good job there but theres a lot more work that we can do and i think theres also a role of product development in that respect if you look at the match strategy that we have as a company its really about looking at whats happening inside of our social casino games or slots games where when you talk of those players the next most likely game for them to play is a match game and so we want to build on that relationship that we have with that player by being able to – and keep them in the zynga ecosystem by giving them the opportunity to play a match game with the same brand whether its a wizard of oz or even maybe its a new brand like crazy cake swap so its a combination of adding additional channels to our ua its about also doing a little bit more product development in the affinity adjacency areas that i discussed and then when we look at advertising the rubicon sponsorship stuff hasnt had a significant impact on the overall flow of the business its really much more traditional ad products some direct ad selling and some other things but the team is showing me a list of new ad products that theyre investigating that are looking at them im really impressed with what we can do there colin a sebastian  robert w baird  co inc broker thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mike hickey with the benchmark your line is open please go ahead michael hickey  the benchmark co llc hey frank welcome and congratulations on your first quarter here good start im curious you obviously have a pretty good slate through fiscal  most of which if not all are in beta youve also provided us some more clarity i guess on expectation at least for when these products are actually going to launch so thinking about q relative – your fiscal year obviously we dont have fiscal year guidance but can we expect q bookings and ebitda at least relative to your guidance to be the low point for your fiscal  year and then second question im not sure if this is in the letter or not but can you update us sort of your perspective on the ma opportunities you see moving forward thank you frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director sure ill take the second question first with regards to ma ill just come out clearly on this im not interested in big ma i think that zynga is the type of company and it has a proven track record for buying small companies and small developers that tuck in nicely to the studio culture and infrastructure thats where id like to go in terms of ma its absolutely a great opportunity for us to go out and look for good great game teams that would fit with our culture and our mission and were seeing opportunities like that in the marketplace as some of these consolidation forces start to hit mobile and some of the smaller companies start to feel some pain were seeing a nice inflow of talent and opportunities on that front but in general were going to stay away from the big ma activities on the bookings and guidance front im  days in and im trying to a handle on frankly how we think about the company over the next three years not the next three quarters and as i look at q and what were working through there on the legacy mobile games and also the web business  i felt good about where we were coming out on guidance there i think that as we look at q and you look at how the slate unfolds yeah wed like to see better performance in q and q but its hard for me right now to give any forward look there just given where im  days in and im still looking at how all of these pieces fit together michael hickey  the benchmark co llc all right fair enough thanks frank operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dean prissman with morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead jonathan p lanterman  morgan stanley  co llc hi this is actually jon lanterman in for dean just a question on advertising obviously a very strong quarter for you guys it sounds like its still predominantly driven by words with friends we know you have advertising in some of your other games so maybe why has it not worked out so well in these other games is this just a function of the installed base at words with friends is just so much larger or is there some kind of tradeoff between different monetization methods between inapp purchases and advertising thanks frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director its a function of a couple of things first off words with friends is just a very large audience to monetize and it really – the design of the game lends itself to add products as you look at some of our other games for one reason or another we have strong performing advertising and then we dont in others and so one of the things that im looking at right now is our overall ad network and inventory across the enterprise are the ways that we can enhance and optimize that going forward so its something that were definitely looking at i dont think we are at a definitive point here where the inventory wont be able to be increased and the effectiveness of new ad products can come to bear so our goal is to continue to look at ways to bring the ad model to more of our games because its a great way to monetize in a freetoplay world where relatively low percentages of your players are converting to inapp purchases there is also a lot of traffic there that are more than willing to look at advertising or be able to have – see an ad gets a batch of coins or a particular earn out so were seeing those kind of earnout ads as something thats interesting to us longerterm so thats how were thinking about it jonathan p lanterman  morgan stanley  co llc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of arvind bhatia with crt capital your line is open please go ahead arvind bhatia  crt capital group llc thank you frank just a couple of questions first on the discussion that youre going to be focusing on quality versus quantity can you give us some early sense of how you are thinking about for  and sort of i guess youre saying that there are going to be fewer titles but just to help us understand where were going with that and then as you think about the longterm margins and i appreciate the color on that but can you – when you think about the peers out there it runs the gamut and margins obviously can be very high maybe provide us some more commentary on whats a good level to sort of shoot for say within the threeyear horizon thats youre targeting frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director okay let me start with the  slate discussion one of the things that was what we attacked first as we started working together a couple of months ago as a board member and now as ceo was i wanted to accelerate the development of our  slate earlier in  so that we had a much more predictable title plan in  and that also meant that we could keep the teams smaller over a longer period of time which is where i believe you get the best games so im not prepared right now to give you a sense of how many titles that were going to be able to release in  i can tell you that weve begun a lot of work on our  slate and one of the key decision points on whether were ready to commit to a game in  is whether or not the game can demonstrate that it had longterm engagement and so that when we do put the game out that it goes into the charts and it sustains and so thats as i talked earlier about dev practices and how were thinking about greenlights for  those are some of the criteria that were looking at and i can tell you that were staring earlier on our  games than ever before and thats every exciting and the teams are finding that that freedom and time to be able to innovate and focus is well spent in terms of the margins in the peer set when i say peer set im thinking king im thinking activision im thinking ea im thinking nexon were here to get into that conversation and ive been on a journey where weve experienced those in other parts of my career and i think it can be done here its a combination of really breakthrough creative ideas that manifest themselves in game its about making the social competitive advantage come to life in our products and its also being a really good steward of the resources and people that we have and making sure that were maximizing leverage it means that were going to focus on the biggest ideas that we have and go allin on them but were not going to have a million ideas and keep our partner – our focus much more narrow and much more oriented to creating that operating leverage over the long term arvind bhatia  crt capital group llc again one last one frank on dawn of titans given the competition in the genre – and you touched on it a little bit from an marketing standpoint – is there – would you like to call out maybe or maybe quantify some of the marketing resources you will be putting in place ahead of that i mean in q and then as the game launches in q frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director yeah the category that it competes in is action strategy which is a competitively intense category with some fantastic products from supercell and machine zone and some of the others the key thing is that dawn of titans is very differentiated versus those it really stands out its positioning itself to really have a highend look and feel its almost a console game on your mobile device and so i feel really good about how itll stand out in the marketing and i think it has a unique position that will serve itself well as mobile game players are looking for something new at christmas or want to try something it makes an incredible first impression and so when i look at the release at holiday i – were really focused right now on trying to drive marketing programs that deliver great organic installs and gives us a great momentum out of the chute and then look at how we use very selective and very surgical paid acquisition over that timeframe one of the great things about holiday is theres a lot of organic acquisition opportunities if you get ahead of it and you can start to go after it but well look at the full marketing mix available to mobile games and our focus right now in this early part of summer is nailing the organic programs and then starting to get in position for the paid ac for later arvind bhatia  crt capital group llc great thank you frank and good luck frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of heath terry with goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead heath terry  goldman sachs  co great thanks i really appreciate that just wondering if you could give us a sense – i do want to follow up on this marketing question given the importance of dawn of titans later this year should we expect a similar televisionfocused campaign there you mentioned specifically in your prepared remark the organic opportunities that obviously come from the network that you have but just sort of curious whether or not theres going to be sort of a similarsized outsideof networkcampaign along the lines of what youve seen for other big launch titles that at this level and then also on the advertising side to the extent youve started using thirdparty partners like rubicon is there any sort of early read on what the either effective cpms or monetization rate that youre able to see through the third parties relative to what you were doing on your own frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director great so on the first part when i think about how were going to bring dawn of titans to market we really want to engineer a hit and we want to make sure that we give that product its maximum opportunity reach to the biggest audience possible if that includes tv then well evaluate it and well look at the roi i think the larger point i would make in the context to that is were going to make commitments to driving over the long term much better margin performance for this company on an operating level and that means that we need to be very clear about how we spend our marketing dollars and that we get the most out of them i do not want to be in this arms raised of ever increasing marketing spends because i dont necessarily believe thats the right thing to do for this company we should spend to the level that we believe we can nail our objectives and then look at very creative opportunities but in general sometimes were just going to have to say no to some marketing spends and were going to have to be clever about how do we generate that demand in another way whether its through network whether its through designing the game so that we dont lose the customers as quickly or we dont want have to reacquire them theres other ways to try and deal with this issue that ive been trying to challenge the company and myself with because i dont believe increasing marketing over the long term is going to be a smart strategy for us if television makes sense and we get strong rois no problem well go for it ive done a lot of television campaigns in my career and well use that tactic if it makes sense but in general its always going to be keeping in mind the fact that we need to maintain cost discipline in how were going to market in addition to the effectiveness of the campaigns that were putting together on the advertising front its a little too early to tell on thirdparty versus direct sales on the internal team thats something that we can update over time but i would hesitate to give any updates right now because i think its too early to tell heath terry  goldman sachs  co okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ben schachter with macquarie your line is open please go ahead benjamin schachter  macquarie capital usa inc frank what is it about mobile gaming that allows so many of the topgrossing titles to stay there for such a long time and then separately any chance youll move beyond mobile and reposition the content onto console or go back to pc gaming in any other way and then finally last one is just on ad revenue as a percentage of revenue how should we be thinking about that for q  and longer term thanks frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director what i think separating game – look theres i think theres something like  mobile games released a year and theres probably  that matter and  that really matter in terms of their performance now you can run very successful businesses in the charts that are below  but in general you want to be in that conversation what separates those games from everybody else is i believe longterm retention and having an engaging relationship with the player over their whole player lifecycle not just day one through  but day  and having a core compulsion loop of the game thats surrounded by systems that allow you to give the player different things to do over that long period of time across different session lengths whether the session is an hour long or two minutes long the games that are doing well at the top of the charts respect that players time and give them something really cool to do in those different session lengths so for me it starts with longterm engagement now of course theres things related to that but in general that would be the headline there in terms of expanding outside of mobile its not something im giving a lot of thought to right now honestly i think we have so much room to grow in the near term in mobile against our existing proven brands and categories that well think about it more long term as we start getting our momentum and start putting points on the board in terms of the company in terms of ad revenue and guidance in terms of the second quarter i think its – i wouldnt consider it up or down based on what our q performance is i think you can think of it in generally in terms of its flat quarter over quarter its seasonal coming off a holiday obviously holiday is a big boom for us and then we saw – its actually the ad market continued pretty strong into q but seasonally q and q are usually flat operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mike olson with piper jaffray your line is open please go ahead mike j olson  piper jaffray  co broker hey good afternoon so you described some of the categories that drove upside but can you say which specific games in the quarter exceeded expectations was it primarily words with friends and then some of the slots games and then secondly it looks like you finished up the remaining amount on your  million share repurchase authorization in the quarter is there any remaining share repurchase authorization currently or no frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director the titles in the quarter that really drove performance on the live services level was our social casinos slots business poker and words with friends in addition to that farmville country escape had a very nice first quarter those were the standout titles there in terms of looking at the buyback we completed the buyback that was authorized earlier in the year and as it relates to go forward there are no additional buybacks authorized at this time mike j olson  piper jaffray  co broker thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of justin post with merrill lynch your line is open please go ahead mike j olson  piper jaffray  co broker thank you craig i dont know if you could just address this but you did see mobile users uptick quarter over quarter after a few quarters of declines maybe talk a little about that and then how do you feel about monetization of users do you still have a lot of room there or are you doing a good job – is the company doing a good job monetizing the users that you have thank you frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director yes we did see an uptick in our mobile users quarteroverquarter which was very encouraging i think thats the function of the focus that mark brought to the company when he came back earlier in the year just really start to drive and prioritize our live services performance and then as we accelerated it over the last few months the bold beats is how we think about it a live game thats operating has a highly engaged large audience and we need to put more development dollars and talent against creating big title updates and bold beats that reengages and it drives things like the number of moves per player session lengths those are the things where i see a lot more yield opportunities inside the company where were treating our live services as important or more important than some of our new releases especially in our businesses where we have a lot of scale and momentum like slots words with friends and poker so very encouraging to see that were now back in the business of trying to grow audience thats going to be long term really important thing for me is to make sure that were making the moves and making the investments to grow our audience over the long term in terms of monetization pov i think that theres – when we convert somebody to a payer we do pretty well relative to the competition what i know is kind of the best practice but i do think you can always improve the key is to make sure that youre really giving the player value and if they feel like oh wait i just didnt buy something they feel like theyve extended their experience so its a bit of art and science and i think were pouring  at a pretty good level but you can always incrementally improve but youve got to be very careful that you dont overdo it because what youll do is youll drive those customers out of your service and those players will move onto something else and then youll have to reacquire much more expensively or you lost them so its definitely an art form and its something that we take pretty seriously mike j olson  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of richard greenfield with btig your line is open please go ahead rich greenfield  btig llc hi thanks for taking my question i wanted to come back to trying to get at what kind of the organic part of the business is because youve obviously got the sustaining games that obviously you have to invest in and then all of your growth initiatives and i havent seen your new employee count in your q but as of the end of last year you had roughly  employees which i think is down over  over the last two years and im wondering out of those that  how many of those people do you actually need to run all of the existing games that are generating revenue over the – if you look at it right now how many people of the  are generating current steadystate revenue that youre generating and how many are all focused on all of the new game initiatives that the company has as you think about your  slate and beyond and how much actual – if you took away those incremental employees or incremental investment how much ebitda or earnings would zynga actually be generating now if it just focused on what it was already executing on frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director its a great question and it points to some of the things that ive highlighted in how are we going to get more yield out of what weve got and it comes down to looking at the deployment of the teams and the talent inside the organization and frankly putting them in the places where they can have the most impact and can have a fantastic experience with zynga so thats – i dont disagree with what youre raising and in fact that im thinking about that as were looking at our deployments and as were starting to put in place our investment strategy on a goforward basis but that that certainly is something that we look at because the yield off of the live services at scale is extremely high they are very good businesses and what we cant do though is take all that goodness and let it go to the – go to the wins by overdeploying and overcommitting to too many other things that take too long or dont come to market or frankly shouldnt have been started in the first place and so thats how we think about it rich greenfield  btig llc i mean is it at a couple of hundred million dollars at least of profitability on the ebitda line frank d gibeau  chief executive officer  director on my first earnings call i think it would be foolish for me to answer that question so i will have to answer it over the course of my career at zynga joo mi kim  senior director of finance and investor relations zyinga inc great unknown speaker fair enough joo mi kim  senior director of finance and investor relations zyinga inc that was our last question thanks everyone for joining us today we appreciate your interest
