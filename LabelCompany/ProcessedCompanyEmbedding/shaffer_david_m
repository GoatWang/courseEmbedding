training in london england he qualified as a physician at university college london undertook his training in pediatrics at great ormond street hospital for children in london and trained at the maudsley hospital study of suicideedit at maudsley shaffer conducted the first epidemiological study of child and early adolescent suicide using the psychological autopsy methodcitation needed findings included the short delay between experiencing a stressor and the act of suicide the frequency of aggressive behavior and the suggestions that imitation played a role in youth suicide these findings would later be confirmed by his much larger controlled study in new yorkcitation needed important findings from the new york study were the very high prevalence of alcohol and substance abuse in older male teens who committed suicide and the significance of a prior suicide attempt as a predictor in males but not females for whom major depression was especially important the finding of specific profiles and the almost universal presence of treatable psychiatric disorders among suicide victims suggested that case finding would be a viable method for preventing suicide however one approach to this—suicideawareness educational programs—was found to offer few benefits and potential riskscitation needed  this stimulated the development of a screening strategy instead ultimately

designed to assess more than  psychiatric disorders occurring in children and adolescents and can be administered by lay interviewers after a minimal training period shaffer has led the development of several editions of the disc including the current version nimh disciv which is based closely on dsmiv disciv includes a computerized version of the interview that incorporates voice technology this has greatly reduced the cost of administrationcitation needed and allowed for selfcompletion by youth unable to read obviating the constraining presence of an adult interviewer the disc has been translated into nine languages and has been used in approximately two hundred child research projects elements of the disc have been employed by large multisite studies such as the mta federally administered regular surveys such as nhanes and a number of other longitudinal studies the availability of the instrument has for the first time allowed careful examination of patterns of psychiatric comorbidity and how this emerges over time a matter of great importance for dsm the american psychiatric association has just funded a grant to shaffer’s group to reexamine disc data on twentysix thousand subjects for the purpose of identifying critical questions for dsmv shaffer’s contribution to psychiatric classification dates back to  when he collaborated with sir michael rutter to explore

release dated august   which is located web site at wwwenersyscom now let me turn it back to you dave david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer thanks mike on wednesday we announced our first quarter results of a  per share which was above our guidance range of  to  youll notice on slide three we had a very good quarter punctuated with an alltime record for gross profit of  we also had first quarter records for as adjusted operating earnings dollars and percentage as well as earnings per share of a  we experienced organic growth in all regions and lines of business although our first quarter of fiscal year  had four more working days than the first quarter of  on a per working day basis sales were mildly higher the increased yearoveryear profitability was due primarily to the lower commodity cost higher volume positive mix and lower shares outstanding please turn to slide four i now want to focus on our current business activities and second quarter guidance during our first quarter the global motive power business continued to experience positive organic volumes in all regions and our premium products continue to resonate with our customers global orders for motive power batteries continue their slow growth pattern asia continues to be our highest growth area benefiting from the conversion to internal combustion for trucks to electric in the other regions our convert to electric or what we call ce market development efforts also continued sustained growth please turn to slide five moving to reserve power in the americas during the first quarter we experienced positive yearoveryear organic volume and that growth continues in our recent order trend these increases continue to be driven by our thin plate pure lead batteries for uninterrupted power supply or ups cable tv and our ad business telecommunications orders remained flat during the first quarter we did not see much volume for batteries for the overtheroad trucks due to our new fleet customer working off existing battery inventory we anticipate that these sales will begin during our second quarter and increase in earnest during the fall and winter as i stated on our last investor call we believe batteries for the us fleet trucks engine start and auxiliary power needs will be a nice growth market for enersys in our emea region reserve power sales and orders in the first quarter versus last years first quarter were flat telecommunications orders were down yearoveryear primarily due to reduced sales to the emerging markets as we near the tail end of g installations in western europe ups orders continue to do well and benefit from the recent european union decision on safe harbor personal data privacy and storage given the sluggish reserve power business in the emea region we remain focused on completing our sga restructuring programs to reduce reserve power costs in our asia region we were able to increase our first quarter profitability to near  operating earnings there were several catalysts for this first quarter improvement in india our results were closer to breakeven versus being a drag in previous quarters and the g buildout of the chinese telecommunications industry continued looking forward our ics enclosure and service business in australia recently received some nice orders that were due to our continued efforts to combine our ics and enersys teams based on the above trends and information our earnings per share guidance for our second quarter is between  and a  in our second quarter we expect the normal seasonal vacation trends in europe and the us will cause our sales volume to be sequentially lower on wednesday we announced that our board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of  per share payable on september  please turn to slide six we have hired jörn tinnemeyer as our chief technical officer jörns experience in advanced storage energy solution in lithiumion at the teco group atl and

record levels of profitability i know we can achieve higher levels of execution and that is the message i have sent to our management teams around the world there are opportunities for additional cost reductions new premium product offerings in tppl nickel zinc and lithium as well as new markets to enter i remain excited about enersys future and the shortterm and longterm opportunities we are pursuing and now ill ask mike schmidtlein to provide further information on our results and guidance michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance thanks dave for those of you following along on our webcast i am starting with slide eight our first quarter net sales increased  over the prior year to  million due to  increases in volume and  from acquisitions offset by a  decrease from currency translation on a regional basis our first quarter net sales in the americas were up  to  million while europes were flat at  million and asia increased  in the first quarter to  million in the americas a  increase in organic volume and  from acquisitions offset a  currency decline europe had a  increase in volume but a  decline in price and  in currency in asia volume increased  and the recent ics acquisition contributed  growth while pricing increased  offset by a  decline in currency translation on a product line basis net sales for motive power were up  to  million while reserve power increased  to  million despite the  currency headwind motive power enjoyed a  volume gain and  price improvement while reserve power enjoyed a  volume increase and  from the ics acquisition offset by a  negative currency translation please now refer to slide nine on a sequential quarterly basis first quarter net sales were down  from the fourth quarter to the first quarter on a fewer working days with  less organic volume net of  currency improvement the americas region was flat while europe and asia were down  each on a productline basis motive power was down  and reserve power was down  now a few comments about our adjusted consolidated earnings performance as you know we utilized certain nongaap measures in analyzing our companys operating performance specifically excluding highlighted items accordingly my following comments concerning operating earnings and my later comments concerning diluted earnings per share exclude all highlighted items please refer to our companys form k which includes our press release dated august   for details concerning these highlighted items please now turn to slide  on a yearoveryear quarterly basis adjusted consolidated operating earnings increased approximately  million to  million with the operating margin up  basis points on a sequential basis our first quarter operating earnings dollars were up  million on lower manufacturing and warranty cost with the operating margin up  basis points the increase in operating earnings from the prior year reflects primarily higher volume and lower commodity costs operating expenses when excluding highlighted charges were at  of sales for the first quarter compared to  in the prior year the full years operating expenses for fiscal  should be comparable to fiscal  at approximately  excluded from operating expenses recorded on a gaap basis is a charge of  million related to the erp system implementation in our americas region including a  million writeoff of previously capitalized costs we determined that previously capitalized costs associated with the implementation should be written off after reassessing our software designs subsequent to encountering difficulty in our rollout at our pilot location excluding those charges our americas business segment achieved an operating earnings percentage of  versus  in the first quarter of last year primarily from the impact of higher sales and lower commodity costs on a sequential basis americas first quarter increased  basis points from the  margin posted in the fourth quarter due to lower warranty costs europes operating earnings percentage of  was down slightly from last years and last quarters  the operating earnings percentage in our asia business unit in the first quarter of this year improved to  from a  loss in the fourth quarter of last year and breakeven income in the first quarter of last year asias sequential operating improvement reflects better volume and lower warranty cost please move to slide  as previously reflected on slide  our first quarter adjusted consolidated operating earnings was  million was an increase of  in comparison to the prior year with the operating margin increasing  basis points to  excluded from our adjusted net earnings for the first quarter was approximately  million of highlighted charges the largest being the sap writeoff of  million net of tax which i previously mentioned please see our press release issued yesterday for details of those items our adjusted consolidated net earnings of  million increased  from the prior year or  million and remained steady at  of sales the  million increase reflects the  million higher operating earnings a higher tax rate and a  million negative currency headwind our adjusted effective income tax rate of  for the first quarter was comparable to the prior quarter but higher than the prior years first quarter rate of  due to discrete items we believe our tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal  will be between  and  and for the full year we expect the  rate on our adjusted earnings however this assumption anticipates no significant changes in tax rates or legislation in the countries we operate in eps increased  to a  on higher net earnings with  million fewer shares outstanding the lower average diluted shares resulted primarily from share buybacks last fiscal year we expect our second fiscal quarter of  to have approximately  million of weighted average shares outstanding please now turn to slide  now some brief comments about our financial position and cash flow results our balance sheet remains very strong we now have  million on hand in cash in shortterm investments as of july   with over  million undrawn from our credit lines around the world we generated  million in cash from operations in our first fiscal quarter of  our bank credit agreement leverage ratio remains at  times and will likely drop below  times by the end of the year barring any significant acquisitions capital expenditures were  million in the first fiscal quarter of  compared to  million in fiscal  we expect to generate adjusted diluted net earnings per share between the  and a  in our second quarter of fiscal  which excludes an expected net charge of  per share from our restructuring and acquisition activities we anticipate our gross profit rate in our second fiscal quarter to be comparable to our first quarter and our interest expense to be approximately  million in conclusion we believe we remain well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities now let me turn the call back to dave david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer thanks mike michelle we will now open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of ben hearnsberger with stephens your line is open please go ahead ben hearnsberger  stephens inc hey thanks for taking my question dave im curious with the hiring of a cto are you going to be more focused on rd going forward david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer certainly what were focused in is making sure that we have a product roadmap thats lined up with the future needs in the energy storage areas historically weve put more of our emphasis on development or really applicationspecific product development as opposed to pure rd so i dont anticipate any major change in that strategy we do want to broaden the playbook a little bit and again we want to make sure that were looking down the pipe and thats the key reason to bring jörn onboard is sometimes you can get a little myopic just doing the same thing so we want to have a fresh set of eyes and were trying to develop the right roadmap and well talk a lot about that at the investor day in february ben hearnsberger  stephens inc okay and then kind of getting into interquarter trends can you touch on what youre hearing from your large americas telco customers david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer yeah its quite i think what i had mentioned on the last calls is pertinent again were in the cycle of relatively stable comps mostly related to the replacement interval so we are out there replacing batteries and the guys get their annual budgets for maintenance and they are replacing batteries there is not a lot of new network construction going on that we know of right now and so the replacement is sustaining us this is specifically in the us and we certainly have our ear to the ground i think whats really relevant ben and this is what the guys are talking to me a lot about and i think this yahooverizon tieup is a good example of it the lines are starting to get blurred somewhat between what we considered are traditional data it customer set and our telecommunications customers even the cable television as well its getting harder and harder for us to see the hard lines of differentiation between these folks the one thing i think we all remain confident about is that the amount of data the amount of servers how much the internet of things is going to enter all of our lives its simply explosive and will continue to be so and were in the backup power business and i think weve seen recently how critical backup power systems can be to sustaining these data driven business models but getting back on a pure kind of wireless telecom infrastructure that weve seen we dont have any sort of updated timetable for you on g or anything like that but business is certainly stable and the replacement intervals are sustaining us today ben hearnsberger  stephens inc okay and looking at the fleet truck opportunity can you give us a sense for how much revenue that can contribute this year and then should we expect more announcements with other potential customers in that market david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer yeah thats a good question weve been at this for a while in the smaller scales this opportunity that weve introduced here is probably the most significant scale customer and the first one for sure i think dimensionally we could say year one which is off to a slow start as i said in the prepared remarks maybe  million to  million incremental and year two maybe  million to  million would be some good dimensioning on this and again the benefits of this technology the life the vibration resistance the heat tolerance the additional capacity its not just relevant to one fleet customer its relevant to all of them so we want to build from this new base were excited about it and its off to a little slower start than we wanted as i said the customer had some inventory to work down before we get started in earnest this will really be an h story the way its shaping up ben hearnsberger  stephens inc okay thanks for taking my questions david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer sure good to hear your voice operator thank you and our next question comes from line of michael gallo with cl king your line is open please go ahead michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc hi good morning congratulations on the solid results david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer thanks michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc just a couple of questions dave europe i think you mentioned being at sort of the tail end on g roll out in western europe do you expect that to start to fall off in the second quarter or in the second half or was it still pretty good in the current quarter i mean i was wondering if you could put some context around what you should expect in european reserve thanks david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer yeah i would say mike weve got a – and im looking across the table at todd to see if he disagrees with this at all but it feels like were pretty near the bottom and again similar to the us we rely heavily in telecom on the replacement intervals there is one thing i dont know mike that weve talked about a lot in the past but several of the largest oem telecommunications customers are european based and often times we would sell them batteries in europe and it would be recognized in our emea results but that doesnt mean the ultimate home for those batteries was in europe and so some of the slowdown also is a reflection of a general malaise and in telecom spending globally so we feel it in europe because thats where a couple of our big customers are domiciled but its not necessarily all a european story and as you know a lot of the telecommunications development historically in the last decade has been in the developing world places like africa and south asia and southeast asia and as you know given the current economic climate things are slower than they were over the last decade so its a cycle but i just wanted to make sure that we pointed out that some of what we see is just the impact of the global spending of telecom given where those oems are domiciled michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc just a followup on that dave i mean any thoughts or any initial comments about what you see going on in the uk with brexit i mean has it sort of frozen our budgets i mean do you expect to see some impact there or is it pretty much business as usual david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer we think we have seen some impact there i think that mostly a top line story i can say today the uk sales are roughly  of our european number its been higher than that in the past so were already seeing some impact from that the guys had to do some price increases which you dont want to do but its necessary given the change in the pound and just as a reminder we have a lead acid battery factory in the uk so its not all bad news because from a – relative to the us dollar some of our conversion cost on that particular facility are improving but in general the biggest impact of brexit for us is going to be how well that uk sales team can deliver as the british folks work their way through this uncertainty period michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc okay great and then just a question on the motive market dave i know youve talked in prior quarters about some shift towards the cheaper lower end or private label batteries i know one of your customers recently alluded to some mix shift towards lower end fork trucks in terms of the overall numbers and i was wondering if you can give us an update on what you see kind of broadly in motive by geography obviously its had a great run of growth over the last six years or seven years but what do you see from how that market is kind of shifting now thank you david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer were not seeing still our topline numbers in motive asia is okay asia is growing at a pretty good clip but in the us and europe weve been in a fairly steady environment and i dont see any major change from that weve been very focused on mix in both regions thats really critical to our performance is our ability to sell to customers better value products and whether its a new charging system whether its a thin plate pure lead technology whether its our square tube that weve done so well with and were making some good success within europe thats really where our focus is but its not been a great new story now in terms of the sustainability i just want to take you back to things we talked about last session is again our business tends to be heavily on the retail industries on the food industries on the automotive sector and some of these businesses are holding up in the us more so than some of the real heavy industrytype markets so weve done well there and then i think what we also discussed is that online retailing supply chain complexity the number of physical touches that are occurring is also a net positive for our business so were confident that we can sustain these steady rates where we are today and then hopefully as we get through this period of political uncertainty we get through the election season maybe some of the more optimistic forecast we recently read about in wall street journal last week that can just – that tide can lift everybody off of these fairly steady growth rates michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc thank you david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer okay operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of john franzreb with sidoti your line is open please go ahead john e franzreb  sidoti  co llc dave lets just stick with the forklift truck market for a second the global orders have been pretty good and you just described that your volumes have been rather flattish is there a market share issue going on there that we should be more cognizant of when we look at some of the global order trends relative to your volumes david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer john i think its more complicated than that i think that trying to correlate the wits statistics with battery sales is tricky so we tend to be cautious about worrying about share losses associated with those figures we do more of our share analysis based on industry trade statistics we base it on importexport publicly available statistics we do the best job we can to try to correlate battery sales directly with the wits statistics can be very difficult there is a lot of competing factors in there i think the most significant element of that is the fleet markets the rental fleets i think that thats been a major trend in this era of low cheap money low interest rates that the ratio of rental or lease fleets versus bought trucks has changed significantly the longevity of the trucks the number of batteries per truck there is a lot of variables out there so i really am hesitant to say that were losing share i dont think were losing share based on any of the statistics we see i think what we have to do is just use that wits statistics more as a barometer and just tell us where the activity levels are in those supply chain especially in the electric forklift markets are but now any share losses weve had have been modest and probably the only area where – and this started when i was in europe is weve intentionally given up some share on the private label business its just the price and the mix just didnt fit our profile it was just unfortunate and so weve walked away from business in europe thats about the only place i think weve lost share the final comment im going to make on share we do the best job we can on calculating market share statistics asia is particularly difficult because there just isnt a cohesive industry organization by which to grab any of these share statistics so there is a little bit in china we get import export statistics but in general i think its very very important not to try to have a oneforone type of correlation between the wits and the batteries john e franzreb  sidoti  co llc no understood just wondering thank you that was helpful david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer okay john e franzreb  sidoti  co llc just shifting gears for a second the gross margin profile alltime record the fleet trucks start ramping up can you talk a little bit about how much of the gross margin profile benefit from the extra days how much is sustainable from restructuring actions and how much will benefit from mix going forward how should we think about companys blended gross margin in coming quarters michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance so john ill take this its mike so i said in my notes that we would expect our second quarter gross profit rate to be comparable to our first quarter which was  so i think you are just still going to see the upper half of the  and while mix is a factor i dont believe that the volumes well see in the upcoming quarter itself are going to move that needle significantly the days themselves have more of an impact – the working days in the quarter have more of an impact obviously on the top line the cost of goods sold because of our fifo methodology of how well hold in inventory for two to three months depending on how long it takes the region to turn their inventory so that the production going on in this calendar quarter that just ended call it july  is going to be hitting our pl in this upcoming second quarter ended september  or thereabout so that has a probably a bigger impact and as you think about those seasons some have the holidays in them some have the summer vacation seasons in them the first and second quarters tend to be pretty good manufacturing or the fourth and the first quarter are pretty good of – our fourth and first fiscal quarters are good manufacturing quarters would benefit the subsequent quarters so we had a steady lead cost that certainly is helpful because the lead – a volatile lead cost it actually sequentially went down a couple pennies so that was a benefit well probably see that rise a penny or two in future quarters but i still think based on everything else and this again is caveat for just the quarter ahead because we dont have order activity enough to see beyond that this upcoming quarter but i think we should be in the zip code we currently are in unless something significant changes in commodities or overall volumes john e franzreb  sidoti  co llc okay ill get back in the queue and let somebody else ask question thanks for taking my question guys michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance thank you very much john operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of william bremer with maxim group your line is open please go ahead william bremer  maxim group llc good morning gentlemen david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer hi bill michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance hi bill william bremer  maxim group llc could i just get an update i know you mentioned very briefly in your commentary on the enclosure business how is purcell and the strategy there internationally and just expanding that out david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer purcell is largely a function today of the telecommunication spend in new equipment and as i noted earlier that continues to be soft and as such the purcell business continues to be soft but as we said earlier there is tremendous opportunities in other markets beyond telecom and there is really some operational synergies as well with purcell that were exploring right now so largely there has not been much change in this business now for several quarters its unfortunate but we do have fingers crossed some opportunities out there that may materialize next quarter but i dont want to say too much obviously until we have the fish in the boat but in general it continues to drag along kind of bump along the bottom along with telecom infrastructure spending william bremer  maxim group llc okay next question dave can you give us sort of what was your percentage this quarter in terms of premium batteries and that includes not just tppl but also lithium michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance bill ill take that we typically would say its  and growing the lithium business we did acquire a lithiumbased cobalt disulfide business in florida so we continue to build in that chemistry so i dont think weve hit  and of course the mix from quartertoquarter can change depending on these are typically – some of them are programdriven projects but i think its still safe to say that  to  the overall positives in that is that we are introducing our premium square tube product and our thin plate pure lead product into the european motive power marketplace and the thin plate in the us motive power marketplace so we are looking for everywhere including the overtheroad truck opportunity that dave was describing earlier so we think you will continue to see that grow william bremer  maxim group llc got you got you last question any surprises in terms of your dialog with your customers in terms of their capex plans david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer no theres been no surprises i think one of the things in the telecom world what we see are some fairly steady capex plans from maybe a big large us carrier but how that capital is used whether its software upgrades or network upgrades or hardware that can change meaningfully for us depending on what particular element of their network theyll be focused on in any particular year but with regards to surprises i cant – i am looking around the room here i would say there has been no surprises william bremer  maxim group llc good to hear thanks dave david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer all right operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian drab with william blair your line is open please go ahead brian p drab  william blair  co llc hi good morning david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer good morning brian p drab  william blair  co llc just wanted to ask a followup on the lithium topic and if we could just zoom out and talk about that from a high level for a moment one of the recurring questions that im getting from investors is is lithium an increasing threat to lead acid more and more applications requiring batteries to fit into smaller spaces and also that – obviously the gigafactory gets a lot of press and the cost per kilowatt hour is coming down for lithium cells very significantly if they get that up and running how are you – i know that youre building your lithium portfolio but how can you compete – if the lithium threat is increasingly real how are you able to compete in terms of cost per kilowatt hour given the scale of some of the other operations out there in the world david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer well this is dave very complex question very difficult question to answer ill do the best i can with regards to the gigafactory specifically they are going to be manufacturing an  lithium cell that they were previously purchasing from i think panasonic i think thats probably pretty well documented so its an insourcing exercise and how much theyre going to be able to move the bill of material costs for the product given that most of the cost is material related i dont know that the additional scale and so forth is going to really drive a meaningful impact for the bill of material costs now markup costs logistic costs of course those all change as a result of the gigafactory for tesla but in terms of their ability to make the  cells that much cheaper than whats currently being manufactured in asia thats something to think about scarcity is becoming an issue weve talked about this prior that as these volumes for hybrid electric vehicles electric cars increase certain portions of that supply chain are going to be challenged so whether they can stay on the same curve of reducing cost per kilowatt hour whether they can stay on that same curve is something to think about i think that clearly lithium has been around a while and we have seen in our industrial markets no significant erosion of our business todate and my big focus for the future product roadmap especially with jörn isnt so much on our existing markets but its in markets that either dont exist yet today or markets that we dont participate yet in today so this is where a lot of our future focus is going to be as well and thats where we think that the lithium chemistries do have some inherent advantages and we want to participate when those markets avail themselves so mike do you want to add anything michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance yeah brian i just wanted to you know comment that when we talk about some of the markets the gigafactory et cetera these are all markets that are incremental to our industrial markets electric vehicles home solartype backup energy those are all markets that dont exist today in the industrial market we will continue to see opportunities perhaps to incorporate a lithiumbased approach but our customers are also very much – they value the service and somebody standing up behind the product its going to be there when they need them sometimes these other manufacturers are looking at big quantities and they dont look at designing solutions around smaller sized application so even though the – ill say the price of lithium im not sure the cost but the prices for lithium are dropping then we think we can take advantage of that in select places where you are seeing the biggest splash on lithium are in markets that traditionally have not been the industrial market core david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer yeah i think finally the other piece brian for us is to continue to advance lead acid and so weve got some advanced initiatives there as well which we think is just going to continue to move the gap not on the top but also on the bottom so we arent ignorant we certainly have a forward look but i can just say todate lithium is available today at very low cost in certain parts of the world to mikes point whether or not those suppliers are making any money at those costs or those prices is a topic of debate but again that threat has existed now for several years and todate we havent seen any significant erosion but dont for a second interpret that comment as being naïve or not forwardlooking we monitor this every day michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance and our new ctos background has largely been lithium so were certainly not ignoring it david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer correct brian p drab  william blair  co llc okay thanks thats a great discussion great detail just one more followup on that topic i think you have touched on it here but you mentioned it out of the gigafactory its going to be cell i guess is an  or something similar to that but regardless theyre very focused on one cell type is there something technical regarding that cell type that would prevent tesla from competing in some of these niche markets that youre developing lithium technology for do you have competitive advantage in terms of the type of cell or the quality of cell and customization of the cell for certain end markets that youre targeting david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer okay well i can just say that the rate – debate rages even within our own organization of small format versus large format we make both actually on the lithium cells and you talk to five different engineers and youll probably get five different answers as to what is the best so the team at tesla has locked in on the  its a mass produce that  millimeter diameter  millimeter length during the heyday of the laptop there was many hundreds of millions of those cells made because that was de facto standard  years ago before people moved into more of the charismatic construction so i cant tell you where i land in terms of believing which is the right way to go whether you want a larger  amp per hour cell or ten  amp per hour cells that each has its own advantages i would say that in the electric vehicle market tesla as far as i know is the one thats pushing that we call it small cell construction i think many of the other folks have opted for the larger sizes in our markets weve made similar evaluations and just say im agnostic as long as it makes money im happy so its the making money piece that were struggling with brian p drab  william blair  co llc okay again really appreciate all the detail can i totally shift topics here and ask – i know that you gave all of the disclaimers that i appreciate regarding the wits data but would you mind sharing the latest threemonth rolling averages and wits data that you typically do on these costs david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer sure mike your eyes are better than mine you want to go for it michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance usually when i am talking to investors i focus on the threemonth average compare to the threemonth average of the prior year david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer prior year the blue column michael j schmidtlein  chief financial officer  executive vice presidentfinance the blue column as its printed on ours so worldwide thats a yearoveryear trailing three months this is three months ended june worldwide the truck orders were up  with a  increase in the asia region a  increase in the emea region and a  increase in the americas region david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer and the us specifically was  and that  was for the total americas region brian p drab  william blair  co llc got it okay perfect thank you very much david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer okay operator thank you and our next question is a follow up from ben hearnsberger with stephens your line is open please go ahead ben hearnsberger  stephens inc hey thanks for taking my follow up so i wanted to dig into americas telco one more time can you give us the delta from the peak of the americas telco cycle to the trough or today the delta in revenue just try to give us a sense for how much you backfilled already david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer i dont have that i apologize i dont even know that i want to wing it on that one one of the challenges there is during that heavy investment phase when we were really cranking out the g cabinets and all the batteries for that that may have been a lower period of replacement spending at those customers so theyve since swung the budgets more on the replacement side so i dont even know that i could fathom how to get there so i apologize for not having that one ben hearnsberger  stephens inc thats all right thanks for taking the follow up david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer all right operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time and i would like to turn the conference back over to mr david shaffer for any closing remarks david m shaffer  director president and chief executive officer all right well i just want to thank everybody for taking your time today to attend our call and everyone

autopsy methodcitation needed findings included the short delay between experiencing a stressor and the act of suicide the frequency of aggressive behavior and the suggestions that imitation played a role in youth suicide these findings would later be confirmed by his much larger controlled study in new yorkcitation needed important findings from the new york study were the very high prevalence of alcohol and substance abuse in older male teens who committed suicide and the significance of a prior suicide attempt as a predictor in males but not females for whom major depression was especially important the finding of specific profiles and the almost universal presence of treatable psychiatric disorders among suicide victims suggested that case finding would be a viable method for preventing suicide however one approach to this—suicideawareness educational programs—was found to offer few benefits and potential riskscitation needed  this stimulated the development of a screening strategy instead ultimately shaffer led a team of colleagues in creating the nowdiscredited columbia teenscreen program although shaffers own evaluation of teenscreen found that the instrument had a

development of diagnostic instruments he was charged by the national institutes of health nimh to develop a child version of the dis for use in large field studies the nimh disc is a highly structured diagnostic interview designed to assess more than  psychiatric disorders occurring in children and adolescents and can be administered by lay interviewers after a minimal training period shaffer has led the development of several editions of the disc including the current version nimh disciv which is based closely on dsmiv disciv includes a computerized version of the interview that incorporates voice technology this has greatly reduced the cost of administrationcitation needed and allowed for selfcompletion by youth unable to read obviating the constraining presence of an adult interviewer the disc has been translated into nine languages and has been used in approximately two hundred child research projects elements of the disc have been employed by large multisite studies such as the mta federally administered regular surveys such as nhanes and a number of other longitudinal studies the availability of the instrument has for the first time allowed careful examination of patterns of psychiatric comorbidity and how this emerges over time a matter of great importance for dsm the american psychiatric association has just funded a grant to shaffer’s group to reexamine disc data on

able to quickly get me scheduled for surgery and clearly communicated my path to recovery he did a great job with the surgery and was easy to get a hold of with any questions i had he routinely followed up with my physical therapist to monitor my progression my leg healed faster than i anticipated and i have minimal scar tissue i would definitely recommend him for any orthopedic surgery chicago il  feb  hes very rude and not committed to his patients health or well being very disappointingangel s in bartlett il  jan  i saw dr schafer for a nd opinion because i didnt want to rush into surgery as the st dr recommended im happy i did my physical therapist recommended him based upon his work and how dr schafers patients traditionally heal i think dr schafer is a wonderful doctor and i trust his opinion i drive an hour just to see himanonymous in joliet il  nov  had gotten  surgeries from dr schafer one on each shoulder he mentioned that i didnt need surgery on my torn rotator cuff bicep tendon and labrum i insisted as the pain and mobility were terrible after surgery the first thing he said was glad we did that your shoulder was much worst than i thought once i took a look in there thanks the worst part of dr shafer is his office when wanting to speak with him they basically said make an appointment or get lost do not use himlake villa il  feb  this doctor is very sharp if you havent tried him you are missing out especially if youve had bad experiences with other average orthopedics he takes the time to explains things in detail and is a great listener i had a partial meniscectomy on both knee that went so well i walked out of post op in  hours his assistant is also very good with following thru on all the preop scheduling  paper work have you seen dr david schafer
