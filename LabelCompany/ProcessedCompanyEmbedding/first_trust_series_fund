for the fed to stay on the path to raising rates again by december and initiating reductions to the size of the balance sheet at the next meeting in late september  although investors have their doubts about another rate hike later this year we think those doubts will recede in the next couple of months  slow inventory investment has been holding back the economy in the first half of   we expect inventories to grow in the second half and for real gdp to grow faster as well  its early but right now were penciling in a real gdp growth rate of  in the second half     click here for pdf

goods orders grew at the fastest pace in nearly three years in june as boeing had a surge in orders for new commercial aircraft  still take out orders from the consistently volatile transportation sector and orders rose  in june  that was below what the consensus was expecting but upward revisions to may when added to the june gain shows extransportation orders up   in the past year orders extransportation are up  the largest gain since   the best news in todays report was for shipments of nondefense capital goods exaircraft or core shipments  these rose  in june and revised upward for may  as a result these orders were up at a  annual rate in q versus the q average representing the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth following near constant declines from late  to late   in part this reflects the fact that energy prices have been more stable since the huge decline in late   however it also likely reflects the willingness of businesses to invest more aggressively for efficiency purposes as the labor market gets tighter  it looks like companies may be tired of waiting for washington to make progress on tax reform and other issues and starting to commit to significant longerterm decisions  in employment news this morning initial jobless claims rose  last week to  which is also the fourweek moving average  meanwhile continuing claims declined  to  million  its still early – we will update our models next week as we get more claims data plus the adp report – but plugging todays figures into our models suggests payrolls are up about  in july

federal reserve made no changes to interest rates today and made almost no changes to the text of its statement  however the wording changes it did make strongly support our view the fed will announce the start of balance sheet reductions at the end of its next meeting on september  first the fed qualified its reference to maintaining its current policy of rolling over principal payments by saying this was the policy only for the time being  second at the last meeting in june the fed said renormalization would start this year  now it says relatively soon the same language fed chief yellen used at the press conference but not the feds official statement back in june    third back in june the fed said it currently expected to start renormalizing the balance sheet  that left the fed wiggle room to change its own expectation as if it anticipated the possibility of making a change to its timing  now by removing currently the fed is essentially saying the likelihood of changing its mind is much lower put it all together and it looks like an announcement about renormalization is very likely to happen at the next meeting  moreover there were no dissents at all from todays statement unlike in june when minneapolis president neel kashkari made a dovish dissent      we expect the feds september announcement about renormalization to follow the path suggested in june   for the first three months presumably october – december the fed will reduce its balance sheet by  billion per month  billion in treasury securities  billion in mortgagerelated securities  then every three months the amount of monthly balance sheet reduction will rise by  billion with the same  proportion between treasury securities and mortgagerelated securities  that escalation will continue until the fed is cutting its balance sheet by  billion per month presumably in the last quarter of   meanwhile the fed softened language surrounding inflation expectations but made it clear they still anticipate inflation moving towards their  inflation target over the medium term given the continued improvements in the labor market and consistent – if modest  inflation we still anticipate the fed will raise rates once more in  that may change as markets react to the balance sheet normalization process and additional economic data but unlike many in the market we place the odds of a december rate hike at well over  while others fret about renormalization and rising rates damaging the economy or financial markets investors should remain bullish  look for faster economic growth and a continuation of the bull market in equities in the years ahead  brian s wesbury chief economist robert stein dep chief economist click here for pdf version posted on wednesday july     pm • post link share   printer friendly   new singlefamily home sales rose  in june posted under data watch • home sales • housing  implications  the trend in new home sales remains upward  sales rose  in june and are up a healthy  from a year ago  although the inventory of unsold new homes rose  in june thats not a sign of overbuilding or a reason to be concerned  the months supply of new homes – how long it would take to sell all the homes in inventory – is  months  by contrast the average over the past decade is  months the average over the past  years is  months  moreover  of the current inventory is made up of homes where construction either hasnt started yet or is still underway meaning these arent completed homes sitting unsold that will create a headwind for future construction there are a few key reasons for our positive outlook on housing  first job gains continue which should put continued upward pressure on wage growth  second credit standards in the mortgage market are thawing  third the homeownership rate remains depressed as a larger share of the population is renting leaving plenty of potential buyers as economic conditions continue to improve  look for the upward trend in new home sales to continue in the next few years which means more room for construction and inventories as well  on the home price front the national caseshiller index increased  in may and is up  in the past year  thats an acceleration from the  gain in the year ending in may   meanwhile the fhfa index which measures prices for homes financed with conforming mortgages increased  in may and is up  in the past year an acceleration from the  price gain in the year ending in may   faster price gains and more rapid acceleration in the fhfa index are likely due to stricter limits on building middle and lowerend housing  regulations add to the fixed cost of housing which are easier to absorb on higher priced homes  on the manufacturing front the richmond fed index which measures midatlantic factory sentiment increased to  in july from  in june  the  for july is the highest for any july since the late s and signals continued health in manufacturing click here for pdf version posted on wednesday july

declined  in june posted under data watch • home sales • housing  implications  existing home sales took a breather in june giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month  sales of previouslyowned homes fell  in june to a  million annual rate but are still up  from a year ago  going forward it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going  that being said tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds  inventories have now fallen on a yearoveryear basis for  consecutive months and are down  from a year ago  inventories are now the lowest for any june since at least the late s  this has also affected the months supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was  months in june down from  months a year ago  according to the nar anything less than  months is considered tight supply a benchmark which hasnt been exceeded since november   the good news is that demand for existing homes in june was so strong that  of listings were on the market for less than a month  higher demand and a shift in the mix of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices which have now risen for  consecutive months on a yearoveryear basis and reached a new record high in june  the strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market  tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing tilting development toward higherend homes  the nar suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices  although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates its important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards incomes are growing and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again    click here for pdf version posted on monday july

look much different  our calculations suggest real gdp grew at a  annual rate in q exactly the same as the consensus forecast thats an acceleration from the  pace in q and we expect better growth ahead but consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from washington dc  instead its going to take some concrete steps like less regulation lower tax rates less spending and a more freemarket approach to health care        heres how we get to  for q consumption  automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a  annual rate in q  real inflationadjusted retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a  rate but growth in services was strong in part due to a rebound in seasonallyadjusted utility output after unusually mild weather in january and february  our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services combined grew at a  annual rate in q contributing  points to the real gdp growth rate  times the consumption share of gdp which is  equals  business investment  after clicking on all cylinders in q business investment grew more modestly in q  investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a  rate but commercial construction fell at about a  pace  combined it looks like they grew at a  rate which should add  points to the real gdp growth   times the  business investment share of gdp equals  home building  while boosting utilities in q the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction  home building looks like it grew in q but at a  annualized pace rather than the  pace in q  the trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing  in the meantime a  growth rate will add  points to the real gdp growth rate   times the home building share of gdp which is  equals  government  both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in q  on net were estimating that real government purchases were up at a  annual rate in q which would add  points to the real gdp growth rate   times the government purchase share of gdp which is  equals  trade  at this point we only have trade data through may  based on what weve seen so far it looks like net exports should subtract  points from the real gdp growth rate in q   inventories  we have even less information on inventories than we do on trade but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in q than they were in q which should add  points to the real gdp growth rate keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the gdp release and those figures could change our forecast as well  but for the time being you can put it all together and get an estimate of  for q  no one should be excited or dismayed by this report  it is the epitome of the plow horse pace of growth weve had for the past eight years   hopefully washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last plow horse reports we have to see brian s

watch • home starts • housing  implications  after falling for three consecutive months housing starts rebounded strongly in june beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year  even though both singlefamily and multiunit starts were responsible for the gain in junes headline number in the past year singlefamily starts are up  while multiunit starts are down   the mix of construction has been generally shifting toward singlefamily building and this is a good sign for the overall economy  when the housing recovery started multifamily construction led the way but the share of all housing starts that are multifamily appears to have peaked in  when  of all starts were multifamily the largest since the mids when the last wave of baby boomers was growing up and moving to cities in june the multifamily share of starts was   the shift toward singlefamily is a positive sign for the economy because on average each singlefamily home contributes to gdp about twice the amount of a multifamily unit  based on population growth and scrappage housing starts should eventually rise to about  million units per year in other words much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us  another bright spot in todays report was that housing completions rose  in june and are now up  in the past year  further building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since  in june  expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones  in other recent housing news the nahb index which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated  in july from  in june  expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs faster wage growth and for at least the time being optimism about more marketfriendly policies from the trump administration continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders  on the factory front the empire state index a measure of manufacturing sentiment in new york fell to a still healthy  in july from  in june finally on inflation import prices fell  in june but are up  from a year
