invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search better know a marijuana stock scotts miraclegro this lawn and garden company has a new trick up its sleeve sean williams tmfultralong jul   at am few industries pack the longterm growth potential that comes along with legal pot which is a very big reason why marijuana stock investors have been flocking to the green rush we certainly dont have to look for too long to find robust growth estimates for legal pot cannabis research firm arcview is forecasting that north american legal sales will more than triple from  billion in  to nearly  billion by  investment firm cowen  co has taken things a bit further its calling for  billion in legal cannabis sales in the us by  this would essentially assume a national legalization of the drug given that an estimated  billion in north american sales last year were conducted on the black market per arcview the ability to steadily transition consumers from the black market to legal channels is what provides the marijuana industry and pot stocks with such a robust longterm growth opportunity image source getty images however there are dozens of marijuana stocks to choose from and emotions surrounding the industry run high in other words investors might be buying into marijuana stocks without fully understanding the risks involved with this in mind were taking the time to analyze one marijuana stock each week until weve covered all of the major players with a market cap of at least  million here are the marijuana stocks weve discussed so far gw pharmaceuticals insys therapeutics aphria aurora cannabis canopy growth corp corbus pharmaceuticals cara therapeutics zynerba pharmaceuticals axim biotechnologies medical marijuana inc arena pharmaceuticals medreleaf today were going to take a closer look at scotts miraclegro nysesmg what scotts miraclegro does for many consumers scotts miraclegro is a familiar name as its one of the largest lawn and garden care companies on the planet its primary goal for well over a century has been to help consumers fertilize their lawns and improve their gardens and landscaping youll often find its products under the scotts turf builder ortho roundup or miraclegro brand names the company has well over three dozen brandname products in its portfolio where the company gets its marijuana stock association is through a subsidiary hawthorne gardening this subsidiary provides products geared at scotts burgeoning hydroponics business ie growing plants without soil cannabis specifically medical cannabis can be grown via hydroponics image source getty images promise and opportunities as you can already guess where this is going the most intriguing growth opportunity at the moment for scotts miraclegro is the hydroponics side of its business scotts has long been focused on improving plant growth for consumers and businesses and the expansion of medical and even recreational cannabis is opening the door for its subsidiary hawthorne gardening to provide soil nutrient lighting and hydroponic solutions to aid in the growth and yield of medical marijuana crops though the legal pot industry may be more or less nascent scotts has plenty of expertise in improving yield which makes it a potential leader in soil nutrients and lighting needs its important to note that hawthorne is mostly growing inorganically at present it gobbled up general hydroponics in  and bought a majority interest in gavita the following year scotts ceo jim hagedorn suggested recently that much smaller momandpoptype acquisitions are also in the works but that they usually take longer to finalize since familyowned companies can be a bit of logistical challenge to incorporate into scotts larger business the addition of these familyowned enterprises should further kick hawthornes sales growth into high gear entering june  yeartodate sales for hawthorne were up a blistering  compared to estimated sales growth for the entire company of just  to  this year  yet scotts core business of lawn and gardening care is also what makes this marijuana stock so appealing the company is only generating around  of its total sales from its fastgrowing hydroponics business the remainder of its sales come from its traditional lawn and garden business though this business is susceptible to economic fluctuations and weather patterns it also provides a legitimate fallback for investors should the federal government tighten marijuana regulations in other words this ship isnt sinkable if the marijuana industry encounters problems which isnt the case for most pot stocks image source getty images risks and concerns unlike most marijuana stocks scotts miraclegro is consistently profitable so thats one thing that its investors dont have to worry about nonetheless there are risks and concerns to be wary of to begin with the federal government could indeed put the kibosh on the legal us pot industry at any time if it wanted to which would crush scotts fastestgrowing segment we have to remember that marijuana is still a schedule i drug at the federal level this means that pot like lsd and heroin has no recognized medical benefits and is entirely illegal the federal government has thus far been willing to keep a handsoff approach to legal marijuana delegating the responsibility of overseeing and regulating legal cannabis to the individual states that approve it however white house press secretary sean spicer commented in february that this administration likely wouldnt be so lax on marijuana which means a tightening in regulations could be forthcoming that would be bad news for scotts miraclegro valuation is another concern that should be monitored scotts isnt exactly trading in nosebleed territory at roughly  times its estimated fullyear eps in  but it recently saw its stock explode higher despite issuing a profit warning the entire reason its share price jumped was based on growth from its hawthorne gardening subsidiary while investors ignored weakness in its core lawn and garden business still we need to remember that  of scotts revenue is derived from its traditional businesses if investors place too much emphasis on its smaller fastergrowing hydroponics business we could see scotts valuation rise to an unsustainable level leading to an increase in the stocks volatility its also likely that scotts wont remain the only large player in hydroponics if more states begin legalizing recreational marijuana hawthornes sales growth rate is probably going to slow from its yeartodate  in the years to come image source getty images should you buy scotts miraclegro now for the allimportant question should you buy scotts miraclegro on one hand theres something extremely comforting about having a legitimate lawn and garden business to cushion it if its marijuanabased efforts dont work out hagedorn seems to believe that cannabis can be a growth driver for scotts for years to come but investors in scotts should be well protected from downside by the companys core lawn and garden operations on the other hand scotts has already seen a healthy appreciation in its share price on account of growth in its hydroponics division the only other state to have made an effort since the november elections to legalize medical or recreational marijuana was vermont but its governor vetoed the recreational cannabis bill that made its way to his desk in short expansion isnt a guarantee but its very much needed to keep up hawthornes torrid organic growth rate my personal opinion is if you do you want to dip your toe into the water with marijuana stocks a company like scotts miraclegro is the way to do it the company is profitable and it provides a fallback just in case the legal marijuana experiment hits a snag this doesnt mean scotts is going to be right for every investor but its certainly worth a closer look for those who want to take advantage of growth in the legal pot industry sean williams has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley
