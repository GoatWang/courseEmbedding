corporation a chinese agricultural company  agria corporation nysegro  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»agria corporation a chinese agricultural companyoct  about agria corporation gro daniel gilcher value special situations long onlysummarywe provide an overview about agrias diversified business and past performancewe analyze the companys balance sheet and important fundamentals to evaluate its general financial healthwe conclude that under current circumstances gro does not offer an appropriate margin of safetythe aim of this article is to review agria corporations nysegro past performance after describing the companys broad product spectrum and structure we analyze its fundamental data and balance sheet we hope to provide investors with a more informed estimation of the business with our review the company agria corporation is a globally active agricultural business it stems originally from shenzhen china and was founded in  today it has an important second branch in christ church new zealand from where it runs its international business the company went public  agrias business is divided into two different sectors a seeds and grain this branch researches develops and sells agricultural seeds it has multiple cooperations with universities eg university of sydney and other companies in the field to maintain its stateoftheart product status last fiscal year the company made  of its revenue from this part of its business inside the company the segment is split into a chinese and an international part b rural services this subsidiary of the company specializes in selling livestock and wool as well as farms the installation and selling of pumping and irrigation systems and the selling of specific insurances completes this segment the companys annual report suggests that these services make up around  of its annual revenue the management the board of directors consist of experienced chinese professionals who all hold international certifications in their field all directors hold university degrees from western countries as well with its broad globally distributed product spectrum and its strong connections to different rd cooperations it is reasonable to call gro a diversified agricultural business the experienced team at the top of the company suggests that it is led very professionally lets take a look at the share price gro data by ycharts after its ipo around  the stock lost  of value until  since mid  it is trading in a very narrow range somewhere between  and  usd per adr it already made a runup from  to  and is now on its way down again this is a rather interesting development many chinese stocks lost a lot of value during the last few years gro managed to keep its price level somehow unfortunately the management was not able to bring the share price back or close to the ipo level we might conclude that the company was a rather unattractive play for investors in the last few years without being a steady target of short selling or accused of fraudulent management we think a look into the fundamental data will help us to explain this unusual price development analysis please note that gros fiscal year ends  june cash flow the company last reported a positive cash flow of  million usd it is only since  that they have managed to create a positive inflow of money again the two years before were characterized by slightly negative cash flow we think it is generally a good sign that gro managed to get back to a positive cash flow in a difficult global environment in relation to a market capitalization of only  million usd at the current price level we should not underestimate the value of such a relatively large inflow of money income since the last three years the company reported a steady revenue of approximately one billion usd the company did not manage to create a positive net income during all this time but is back on the earning side since this year gro reported a net income of a small  million usd while  million usd accounts for cost of revenue the other difficult position other operating expenses accounts for another  million usd which is shrinking the final net income generally positive net income is a good sign that a company is operating well on the other side we think recent cost of revenue and other operating expenses are very high compared to gros competitors in the sector earnings per share are then calculated at  per share with  million shares outstanding this leaves the investor with a current price to earnings ratio of  this is generally assumed to indicate a reasonable pricing balance sheet the company once held a strong cash position of more than  million usd in  since then the amount has declined more than  to  million usd at the same time receivables and inventories inflated strongly more than  from  and  million usd to  and  million usd in consequence total assets rose more than  in the last five years this again is a generally good sign still the negative side must not stay unmentioned from an investors point of view the growing positions for receivables and inventories are problematic the more assets of a company are bound in these positions the greater is the risk that shareholders will lose money in the case of liquidation especially as the cash position decreases we are skeptic about this kind of management and would appreciate a larger cash position instead of ever inflating receivables growing inventories might indeed be a necessary effect of growing research efforts etc as a large  million usd position for net property plant and equipment suggests the liabilities section of the balance sheet reveals that agria carries  million usd in short term and  million usd in longterm debts the total liabilities with  million usd are also in the range of the past two years we think it is generally beneficial to prefer long term over shortterm debts however the fact that the positions of other liabilities play such a large role together  million usd here again does becloud the overall picture valuation if we try to calculate a net worth of the company for the worstcase scenario of bankruptcy and liquidation we find that gro might be a very uncomfortable play with its underlying fundamentals if we assume for such a liquidation value liquidation value  assets  liabilities where assets  cash   receivables     net property plant and equipment and liabilities  total liabilities we arrive at a liquidation value of liquidation value   million usd   million usd   million usd the negative amount indicates that if our conservative model is correct in the actual situation the companys shareholders will not see any money in case of gros bankruptcy we think this is besides all other factors an important point against an investment in gro under the current circumstances we think it is reasonable to assume that this tenuous situation is an important reason why the companys share price has not pulled back to former highs substantially as long as the business is not changing its approach towards cash and receivables the situation will not improve we do not see an appropriate margin of safety for longterm investments here at the moment apart from that the current share price seems to match the companys value quite fairly to sum things up we might conclude that agria presents a somehow mixed picture today while negative points overlay the positive aspects in our view we are not generally bearish about the company what we miss the most is a basic financial strength that shields shareholders against bankruptcy if the company improves these critical points we might find it an interesting investment opportunity here conclusion we presented agria as a small and diversified agricultural company that operates worldwide we provided evidence why gros share price has not seen substantial and lasting improvements in the last few years with its current balance sheet we think investors should be careful about investing money here if the general situation improves here we might look at a bargain opportunity in the future disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned
