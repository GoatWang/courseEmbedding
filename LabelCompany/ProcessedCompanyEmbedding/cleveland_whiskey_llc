blog success story  cleveland whiskey   detail cleveland whiskey llc is an innovative startup company founded in july  by tom lix an experienced entrepreneur who started and sold several software and technologyrelated businesses back in his native boston lix and cleveland whiskey use advanced technology to accelerate the maturation of whiskey so that it will take weeks instead of years to produce their designer spirits growth challenge by  lix had already spent considerable time and effort developing his concept in a makeshift basement lab in order to attract serious investors lix needed to upgrade his test laboratory with stateoftheart equipment that included temperature and pressure sensors water filtration plumbing computerized control systems and other laboratory test equipment it would take the right financing space and expertise to make cleveland whiskey a reality how we worked with them while searching for funding lix found the cuyahoga county new product development loan fund administered by magnet from there it was a short step to renting lab and office space in the incubator at magnet which also gave him close proximity and easy access to magnet’s product design  development pdd engineering team the pdd team helped lix create detailed lab construction plans with d cad software while supervising two cleveland state university engineering interns as they installed the lab equipment they also created the interface between the sensors that gather data in the stainless steel whiskey vats the accompanying data analysis program has helped lix and magnet overcome and regulate temperature and pressure issues in the tanks outcome the test lab has worked very well for lix and cleveland whiskey as they look to patent their technology and assemble funding towards full commercial production the company has already received funding from various foundations and funds in cuyahoga county and their technology is already sharply reduced their whiskey’s timetomarket production compared to typical premium whiskey production cleveland whiskey hit store shelves in march of  cleveland whiskey black reserve bourbon review  whiskey with ryan whiskey with ryan a blog dedicated to all things whiskey blog about contact blog categories bourbon buying whiskey uncategorized whiskey cocktail recipes whiskey history whiskey products wish list review cleveland whiskey black reserve bourbon review march   it’s new it’s mysterious and it’s causing quite the ruckus in the whiskey community introducing the latest ohio based bourbon – cleveland whiskey’s black reserve bourbon by definition this new spirit meets the technical standards to be called bourbon but that’s about the only thing standard about their secret process i’ve written earlier articles explaining the regulations and nuances of what differentiates bourbon from whiskey and throughout some of my reviews touched on some of the more interesting grains and their distilling process but the new black reserve bourbon by cleveland whiskey is by far the most interesting process i have come across for starters this whiskey isn’t being made on a country farm but produced in a startup incubator run by magnet manufacturing and advocacy growth network near cleveland state university by entrepreneur tom lix and his sixperson team this small but mighty team is using a patentpending process of “pressure aging” where a machine rapidly pushes alcohol either their home made “white lightning” or sourced  month bourbon they purchase in and out of used and charred barrel staves this unique process aims to replicate the standard aging process that normally takes place when whiskey is placed in the cask but at an expeditious rate they claim that this secret process can “produce a bottle in under a week that can compare to a  or  year old version” you can hear more about this process from tom lix himself in this video from fox  news parting thoughts i’m torn on what to say about the black reserve bourbon by cleveland whiskey… i’m a huge advocate for craft distillers especially those in ohio it’s reasonably priced  and i applaud their use of a new process in order to push the industry for innovation but at the end of the day the focus should be on the taste and not the marketing while i’m curious to see what the future holds for this upstart craft distiller this initial release didn’t live up to their claims of being comparable to a  or  year bourbon already on the market i’m not saying don’t purchase a glass or a bottle i’m suggesting going in with your expectations focused on purchasing it as a novelty whiskey or to support something locally made by a small group of enthusiasts bing places for business bing places for business sign in using your
