when left undetected can lead to significant increased risks of stroke and cardiovascular disease the company’s af patch product will be inexpensive cogs less than unit and easy to use current technologies are cumbersome for the patient and expensive both because of the hardware used and the need for trained technician overview the earlier detection and treatment will also reduce the expensive costs associated with acute care of strokes and cardio vascular disease resulting from untreated patients the licensed proprietary algorithms used by the company allow automated screening with accuracy equivalent to that of trained technicians cardiac insight was founded in  in june  angel investors provide an initial funding investment of  combined with an executed a technology license with the university of washington for an atrial fibrillation detection algorithm an additional m has been raised from private investors and  of previous development has come from grantsgifts wrf cac sttr the company received fda k  clearance for its ecg patch device record only 4 hours in may   additional capital will be used to develop the commercial version of the atrial fibrillation product and pursue strategies for the development of two additional markets   products the simple patch type product can improve the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation the product utilizes a highly accurate algorithm with  sensitivity the device is designed for low power battery operated applications and can be wearable for up to  days the device will allow data to be directly downloaded with automatic report generation in a physician’s office eliminating the need to send the device to a thirdparty service center that is standard practice today in conjunction with a partner the company will also develop a hour sleep apnea screening device similar in form factor to the atrial fibrillation device finally the company will license its implantable algorithm to reduce inappropriate shocks from icd devices    investmentdebtroundsep  4k usdread pressunattributednov  k usdread pressdebtroundsep  k usdread pressunattributedjan  k usdread pressunattributedjan  4m
