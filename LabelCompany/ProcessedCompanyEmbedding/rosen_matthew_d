words of wisdom contact  appointment request matthew rosen    route  suite  pomona new york  email  click here welcome raising children with special needs is not easy and finding the right kind of help can often be a daunting task  while obtaining an accurate diagnosis and receiving effective treatment are good indicators of therapeutic success in the end its all about connection as a child psychologist with over  years of experience my goal is to establish a positive therapeutic connection that is based on mutual trust understanding and respect  this can only be accomplished when both children and parents feel heard and understood  when such a connection is established people can then be inspired to think and act in ways that will be both beneficial and transformative making them more able to achieve their goals and lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life if you have a child who is struggling academically socially andor emotionally and are feeling overwhelmed by their struggles i can help if your child has been diagnosed with adhd placed on medication and continuing to struggle perhaps he or she has been misdiagnosed if your child has been in therapy but is not progressing there may be something missing in the therapeutic connection or in the accuracy of the diagnosis   if youre looking for support and guidance in better understanding your child knowing how to best deal with your childs issues and being able to effectively advocate for your child i would welcome the opportunity to help you achieve your goals   please call or email me to see how i might be of service to you and your child     thought for the day you can’t always get what you want but you can make it easier to get what you want   click here for more words of wisdom
