preclinical trials of the pharmaceutical activation of this pathway test subjects showed reduced fat mass with no loss of lean muscle mass plus a higher rate of energy expenditure increased insulin sensitivity increased fatty acid oxidation improved plasma and tissue triglyceride levels with lower cholesterol upon translation of this pharmaceutical activation to humans these effects are expected

financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form q the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  including without limitation statements regarding our expectations beliefs intentions or future strategies that are signified by the words expect anticipate intend believe or similar language all forwardlooking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements in evaluating our business you should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading risk factors in the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements business overview we are a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of a pharmaceutical preparation to treat obesity and the symptoms of type  diabetes we believe that a drug that will step up the bodys metabolism of fat will address the biggest health problem in the world obesity obesity is also implicated as a causative and an additive to a host of other conditions the most important of which are type  diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer type ii diabetes which now consumes roughly one sixth of every health care dollar in america is a direct result of obesity for our first product opportunity we have engaged charles river laboratories for the discovery of a small molecule drug that activates metabolic pathways to increase energy expenditure in completed animal trials our proprietary approach to the pharmaceutical activation of this lkb ampk  adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase pathway resulted in increased energy expenditure decreased fat mass and resulting weight loss lower blood glucose improved insulin sensitivity lower cholesterol and lower blood triglyceride levels unlike most other fda approved weight loss drugs our strategy does not depend on a pharmaconeurological manipulation of the higherbrain centers for appetite andor satiety rather our proprietary drug approach targets the master energy regulatory pathway that has been proven to exist not only in higher mammals but also in all living cells that possess a nucleus because an intensive aerobic and resistance strengthtraining regime is the natural way to activate these pathway effects we believe that our drug will help obese patients mimic the effect of a more healthy lifestyle and lose weight on november   we were selected to become a resident company at the johnson  johnson innovation jlabs facility at the texas medical center in houston jlabs  tmcx the company has therefor relocated its headquarters to houston texas as of february   the company will begin by occupying office space and will later expand its physical operations to take advantage of the availability of laboratory facilities and equipment and especially the access to expertise and mentoring that make this a compelling opportunity for the company   financial operations overview upon commercialization of the companys obesity therapeutic we will begin working with thirdparty payors to establish reimbursement coverage policies where policies are not in place we will pursue casebycase reimbursement we believe that as much as  of our future revenues may be derived from products billed to medicare we will begin working with many payors including medicare to establish policylevel reimbursement which if in place will allow us to recognize revenues upon submitting an invoice we do not expect to recognize the majority of revenues in this manner until calendar  at the earliest since our inception we have generated significant net losses as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of  we incurred net losses of  and  in the three months ended november   and  respectively and  and  for the nine months ended november   and  respectively we expect our net losses to continue for at least the next several years we anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on research and development both to develop our initial obesity therapeutic and to develop additional products for obesity and type  diabetes scale up our commercial organization and other general corporate purposes our financial results will be limited by a number of factors including establishment of coverage policies by thirdparty insurers and government payors our ability in the short term to collect from payors often requiring a casebycase manual appeals process and our ability to recognize revenues other than from cash collections on therapeutics billed until such time as reimbursement policies or contracts are in effect until we receive routine reimbursement and are able to record revenues as therapeutics are prescribed and delivered we are likely to continue reporting net losses  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we have generated no revenues since our inception product revenues for our first product our therapeutic for the treatment of obesity are expected to be generated from the projected commercial launch in  and are expected to be recognized on a cash basis because we will have limited collection experience and a limited number of contracts in accordance with our policy revenues for tests therapeutic prescribed will be recognized on an accrual basis when the related costs are incurred provided there is a contract or coverage policy in place and the following criteria are met · persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists · delivery has occurred or services rendered · the fee is fixed and determinable and · collectability is reasonably assured determination of the last two criteria will be based on managements judgment regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectability of those fees we expect to generally bill thirdparty payors for our obesity therapeutic upon the filling of a patient prescription accordingly we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with the thirdparty payor we usually bill the patient directly for amounts owed after multiple requests for payment have been denied or only partially paid by the insurance carrier as a new drug our obesity therapeutic may be considered investigational by payors and not covered under their reimbursement policies consequently we expect to pursue casebycase reimbursement where policies are not in place or payment history has not been established contract revenues are expected to be derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and will be recognized on a contract specific basis under certain contracts our input measured in terms of fulltime equivalent level of effort or running a set of assays through our laboratory under a contractual protocol will trigger payment obligations and revenues will be recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed certain contracts may have payment obligations that are triggered as milestones are complete such as completion of a successful set of experiments in these cases revenues are recognized when the milestones are achieved clinical collaborator costs we expect to enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses we plan to record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms all clinical collaborators will be expected to enter into agreements with us which specify work content and payment terms results of operations comparison of the three and nine months ended november   and november   revenues  there were no revenues for the three and nine months ended november   and november   respectively because we have not yet commercialized our obesity therapeutic  cost of product revenues  no cost of product revenues were recorded in the three months and nine months ended november   and november   respectively because we have not yet commercialized our obesity therapeutic general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses totaled  for the three months ended november   as compared to  for the three months ended november   general and administrative expenses totaled  for the nine months ended november   as compared to  for the nine months ended november   this represents an increase of  for the three months and a decrease of  for the nine months ended november   this increase for the threemonth period was due in part to increased costs for legal accounting and other professional costs in the  period the decrease for the ninemonth period was due to a significant charge due to  of stockbased compensation in the  period research and development expenses  research and development expenses were  for the three months ended november   as compared to  for the three months ended november   research and development expenses were  for the nine months ended november   as compared to  for the nine months ended november   this represents a decrease of  for the three months ended november   over the three months ended november   versus a decrease of  over the ninemonth period this threemonth and nine month decrease was primarily as a result of decreased rd activities interest expense net we recorded  of interest income during the three months ended november   and  during the three months ended november   we recorded  of interest expense during the three months ended november   and  during the nine months ended november   we recorded  of interest expense during the nine months ended november   and  during the nine months ended november   net loss as a result of the fact that we remain a development stage company with no product revenues as well as the other factors described above we had a net loss of  for the three months ended november   as compared to  for the three months ended november   and we had a net loss of  for the nine months ended november   as compared to  for the nine months ended november   liquidity and capital resources since our inception we have incurred significant losses and as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future we expect that our research and development general and administrative and selling and marketing expenses will continue to grow and as a result we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability we may never achieve profitability sources of liquidity since our inception our operations have been financed through the sale of our common stock and issuance of debt through november   we had received net proceeds of approximately  through the sale of our common stock to investors in december of  and january of  we entered into a convertible note agreement with two investors for a total of  on april   we entered

equivalents of  cash flows as of november   we had  in cash and cash equivalents compared to  on november   net cash used in operating activities was  for the nine months ended november   compared to  for the nine months ended november   the increase in cash used was primarily due to increased operating expenses net cash used in investing activities was  for the nine months ended november   compared to  for the six months ended november   we expect amounts used in investing activities to increase in fiscal year  and beyond as we expand research and development activities and establish our proposed commercial laboratory net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended november   was  compared to  for the six months ended november   this is mainly due to proceeds received from notes payable and the equity line of credit with corelli capital ag  contractual obligations as of november   we had the following contractual commitments we are required to make a series of annual minimum royalty payments under the license agreement with albert einstein college of medicine beginning on the first anniversary date or march   the initial payment of  due march

loss market mr lau concluded about nexus biopharma wwwnexusbiopharmacom  nexus biopharma inc is developing a revolutionary new weight loss drug that works by adjusting the bodys metabolism to increase the burning of fat by activating the ampk metabolic pathway the same pathway activated by intense physical exercise the underlying biochemistry was described in an article in the journal cell metabolism by claire c bastie and jeffrey e pessin entitled fyndependent regulation of energy expenditure and body weight is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of lkb cell metab  feb  in completed preclinical trials of the pharmaceutical activation of this pathway test subjects showed reduced fat mass with no loss of lean muscle mass plus a higher rate of energy expenditure increased insulin sensitivity increased fatty acid oxidation improved plasma and tissue triglyceride levels with lower cholesterol upon translation of this pharmaceutical activation to humans these effects are expected to have a significant impact on obesity and diabetes using the most advanced high throughput screening technology nexus biopharma has identified small molecule compounds in a number of discrete chemical structure families that can efficiently activate the pathway the company has filed for intellectual property protection on a selection of compounds in a number of discrete chemical backbones the companys goal is to advance to preind trials in preparation for fda human trials of a drug that will safely mimic this effect in humans cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information

what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients including kidney and lung cancer in fact research from the american association for cancer research shows that for advancedmelanoma patients survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer tweet biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types with  medicines and vaccines in development for cancer  percent of which

tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the
