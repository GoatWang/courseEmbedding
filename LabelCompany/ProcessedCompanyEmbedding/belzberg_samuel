tires  march   the belzbergs they like to kick the tires the three brothers are astute bargain hunters who now control more than  billion of assets friends of the family say their recent million purchase of scovill inc proves they arent greenmailers and cheapskatesbut wall street isnt convinced by stratford p sherman research associate darienne l dennis march   fortune magazine – the three brothers are astute bargain hunters who now control more than  billion of assets friends of the family say their recent million purchase of scovill inc proves they arent greenmailers and cheapskatesbut wall street isnt convinced mysterious controversial and very very rich the belzberg brothers of canadasamuel william and hymanconfounded wall streeters in january with their acquisition of scovill inc for about  million the brothers are widely believed to be cheapskatesthey want to buy a dollar for eighty cents complains an investment bankeryet they paid a price for the waterbury connecticut producer of yale locks and other familiar products that some security analysts consider excessive it works out to around  times last years earnings the belzbergs are also regarded as greenmailers yet they appear perfectly happy not to have been bought off by scovill and to be owners of their first us industrial company despite their reputation the belzbergs appear to be nothing better or worse than successful practitioners of a particularly ardent and unmuddled brand of capitalism family intimates say the brothers learned it as toddlers from their father abraham a polish fishmonger who emigrated to canada in  and died a real estate tycoon in  devoted to one another and deeply rooted in family tradition the brothers have been more consistent in their three decades of business dealings than most people realize like their father they are opportunistic acquisitors who regard their capital as too precious to invest in any but the safest tangible assets they like to kick the tires says a financier who knows their ways they shun risk with a firmness that has won them many admirers but few friends in the us when the brothers were just getting started they could borrow only against personal notes backed by everything they owned so a single really sour deal could have wiped them out as a result the belzbergs carefully consider the downside of every transaction once committed they try to proceed with such caution that a profit is virtually guaranteed sam  the middle brother and the only one with a college education approves most of the belzbergs deals his sense of value is so sure that a belzberg investment almost inevitably attracts the attention of arbitragers and competing bidders several of the latter have bought the belzbergs out at prices the brothers probably consider insane last year in an extreme example the belzbergs bought  million of gulf stock  of the total as part of t boone pickenss now famous investment group seven months later chevron corp then standard oil co of california bought the brothers shares for a morethanhandsome  million and the belzbergs dont seem to mind accepting greenmail from independencemindeda nd sometimes economically irrationalmanagements us industries inc and masonite corp paid premiums to buy out the belzbergs and then were swallowed by other companies managements of no fewer than eight other major us companies including blue bell inc and hh robertson co also fought off the belzbergsperhaps motivated partly by fear for their jobs but when the dust settled the brothers almost always came out with a profit it is a wonder that such conservative financiers end up owning much yet the belzbergs holdings are enormous with a net worth believed to run well into the hundreds of millions of dollars the brothers control a large and bewildering collection of public and private companies their largest which sam serves as chief executive provides a classic example of the belzberg approach to leverage first city financial corp a vancouver bank holding company whose shares trade on the toronto exchange the belzbergs  of the stock was recently worth only  million but it gives them control of first citys  billion in assets the companys minority shareholders are not complaining thanks partly to stock profits from all those failed takeover attempts first city has for the last five years produced impressive returns to investors david ramsay of the toronto securities firm wood gundy estimates that its total returnsdividends plus stock appreciationavera ged  a year through  and return on shareholders equity averaged  the brothers use the same leverage technique as  owners of far west financial corp a publicly traded beverly hills savings and loan with assets of  billion their third major public company is owned first city properties of beverly hills with revenues of only  million a year this real estate development company was the vehicle for the leveraged buyout of scovill whose  revenues totaled  million wholly owned first city capital of new york currently holds minority positions in some  major us companies acquired for an estimated  million including a stake in revere copper  brass an investment banker who knows the belzbergs well argues that the brothers all workaholics are so similar the differences arent worth thinking about the three boys as these grown men are still said to refer to themselves at times are all about six feet tall and curly haired though bill  and hy  are balding they are very direct says a friend they dont kill you with subtleties all are known to feel strongly about their identity as belzbergs and as jews though none is orthodox notoriously tough in business the brothers nevertheless know how to relax sharing an easy affability and a sense of humor that relies partly on droll tales from their youth all are devoted family men and two members of the younger generationsams son marc  and hys son brent have taken prominent positions in the family enterprise the brothers are also earnest and generous philanthropists having lost scores of relatives to hitlers gas chambers for example they are heavy backers of the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies in los angeles the brothers are not clones however although they share their profits equally sam who lives in vancouver is usually the brother who earns them he prefers phone calls to memos and frequently jumps out of his chair to pace as he talks sams in the first turn while other guys are still tying their shoes says an exemployee he makes decisions so fast that some of his subordinates suspect he acts on instinct but investment bankers who have worked with him say sam is a relentless and thorough analyst bill the youngest moved to beverly hills in  perhaps to get out of sams shadow he lives in a spanishstyle mansion formerly owned by actor gene hackman and socializes with tv emcee monty lets make a deal hall and other local notables far west is bills fiefdom he is an accomplished dealmaker in his own right with a special flair for real estate but he is a more emotional businessman than sam and a tougher boss six men have served him as president of far west since  bill has often been criticized for renegotiating apparently finished deals he has to be sure he has squeezed out the last dollar says one observer i think hes trying to compete with sam hy the eldest is the least visible he still lives in sleepy calgary alberta and devotes most of his working time to cristys arcade a thriving furniture store inherited from abraham that is among the belzbergs smallest holdings his quiet life was interrupted in  when three armed kidnappers one a car salesman who had lost his shirt in commoditieshurled him into a rainbowstriped van and kept him handcuffed and blindfolded until sam paid a ransom soon recovered of nearly  million hymans other claim to fame is being spotted chatting on an acapulco beach in  with miami mobster meyer lansky who was reportedly there to carve up the action in atlantic city with some business associates eleven years later the brothers had acquired  of bache group and harry jacobs chief executive of the struggling securities house vigorously opposed them perhaps by coincidence reports of the acapulco encounter found their way into the press around that time the familys reputation in the us never fully recovered although the fbi says it has no reason to believe hyman has links to the mob jacobs lost his title and his company anyway to prudential insurance co of america in the first of a wave of socalled financial supermarket combinations the brothers netted  million if their financial dynasty can be said to have a corporate culture it traces back to radom poland where abraham grew up his neighborhood in radom was by all accounts an insular community many of whose inhabitants spoke yiddish hewed to orthodox traditions and had suffered from the depredations of their christian neighbors in that environment clannishness had more than its usual social utility abraham left radom at  one of hundreds of local jews whose passage was paid by an earlier emigree named bella singer when he arrived in calgary abraham joined a small but growing community of transplanted poles abraham began by working as a farmhand and in the abattoir of a local meatpacking plant but his entrepreneurial skills showed up early one of his first jobs gave rise to a family story that sam still uses to instruct his employees the owner of a small market who employed abraham as a produce buyer gave him a raise but didnt give one to his own nephew also a produce buyer when the nephew protested the owner explained that when he sent abraham to the fields to buy strawberries the young man would buy whatever offered the greatest potential for profit but when the inept nephew was told to buy strawberries he bought strawberries by  hardworking abraham was flush enough to bring his wife hinda and daughter fanny over from poland another daughter lil was born in canada then the three sons fanny and lil both of whom married young and now live in calgary near their mother and hy never caught their fathers enthusiasm for commerce but even as children the boys were expected to take paying jobs on weekends they discussed business over the dinner table with their father and each in his turn joined abraham for years a trader of used furniture on his buying trips learning young how to spot value these lessons had their intended effect as the oldest hy joined the family furniture store after a stint in the royal canadian navy sam left home at  to study commerce at the nearby university of alberta selling used cars on the side after graduation he began buying real estate financed by the capital he had accumulated and a  revolving bank credit cosigned by his father bill went into the dogfood business and bought still more real estate later selling his red top brand of processed horsemeat to standard brands adept land traders the brothers also made killings in western canadian oil leases the familys entry into financial services came in  at the time alberta was isolated from canadas torontobased banking community so sam set up city savings  trust co now called first city trust the principal subsidiary of first city financial along the lines of an sl in the states among its original purposes was to finance the familys real estate deals but it became a completely separate line of business for the belzbergs its investments though skewed toward real estate later included equities giving sam the opportunity to develop his skill as a stock picker the belzbergs made their first big moneyand a bunch of enemiesin  a few years earlier they had brought most of their landholdings together into a company called western realty projects ending up with  of its shares after it went public then they accepted a ashare buyout offer from a british company that offered nothing at all to westerns minority stockholders after that the shares never approached  in public trading under laws then in effect the deal was perfectly legal but it understandably aroused the ire of minority stockholders who felt cheated the deal went through even so and the belzbergs got  million with that stake they began investing in the us their original strategy long since abandoned evidently was to build a second financial services empire in the states in a series of quiet and friendly deals they bought far west financial as well as a publicly traded real estate investment trust and several other companies then in  they began investing in bache this episode profitable but unpleasant set the tone for most of the brothers subsequent transactions in the us harry jacobs apparently feared the belzbergs more than beelzebub himselfperhaps with reason given the poor financial performance of the firm under his leadership the brothers started by accumulating a  stake in bache shortly thereafter sam met with jacobs who made it clear he wanted nothing to do with the belzbergs sam kept buying and eventually asked for two seats on the member bache board jacobs refused and sammotivated now by anger according to family intimates bought still more shares eventually raising the familys stake to over  jacobs went wild using treasury stock he acquired an odd collection of small companies including an ohio smelter which diluted the belzberg holdings he didnt protest when baches clients the hunt brothers of texas who had nearly ruined the firm by involving it in their huge silver trading gamble of bought almost  of baches shares and the press got the story of hyman and meyer lansky in the end jacobs fled into the arms of prudential which kept him on as chairman but replaced him as chief executive after a year the belzbergs big profit didnt erase the sting of the smear from that time until the scovill deal the belzbergs were unable to acquire a major publicly traded company in the us they got scovill only by dramatically changing their tactics however fearsome they appeared in the  past in the end the brothers had meekly allowed managements to drive them away this time they used force after buying their usual small initial stake in this casesam filed a hostile tender offer for the first time in his life explains robert s pirie  the investment banker from rothschild inc who represented the belzbergs having managements continually react the way they did made sam realize there was no other way william f andrews  scovills chief executive quickly announced that the brothers ashare offer was inadequate he organized a private auction of scovill inviting the belzbergs to participate they won with an offer of  a shareand a promise to let scovills present management in for a piece of the companys equity the offer bolstered arguments by family loyalists that the brothers far from threatening managements of takeover targets are financiers desperate to keep the operating experts in place andrewss board endorsed the revised offer with every appearance of enthusiasm they were completely open frank and fair says andrews i was surprised the deal surprised almost everyone but it has not put to rest the controversy about the belzbergs intentions the brothers would probably argue that the scovill takeover proves their claim to be acquisitors at heart but wall street isnt convinced contends an investment banker who once worked for the belzbergs they had to buy one to be taken seriously as greenmailers in the future the truth will no doubt become clearer as the brothers bid for more us companies a key executive at a first city subsidiary indicates that belzberg watchers probably wont have to wait long for more clues we are looking at a couple of opportunities he says right now belzberg is turning reins over to nephew  nytimescom log in register now help home page todays paper

economy energy media technology personal tech entrepreneurship your money belzberg is turning reins over to nephew by alison leigh cowan published march   samuel belzberg a yearold financier who rode the takeover wave to become head of one of canadas foremost dynasties is surrendering daytoday control of the centerpiece of his familys empire he will hand the reins of the company the first city financial corporation to his yearold nephew brent s belzberg first city financial whose shares are traded on the toronto stock exchange is the parent company for most of the belzberg family interests though samuel has run the business as its chief executive for  years he and his older brother hyman and his younger brother william each owns  percent of the companys shares the public has owned the balance since the mids two biggest holdings the two biggest holdings of the company are its  percent stake in first city trustco inc a financial services concern and a wholly owned real estate development arm the first city development corporation the company has had a difficult time in the last year starting with its disastrous  run at armstrong world industries based in lancaster pa that takeover battle invited a spirited defense from the floorcovering company and the pennsylvania business establishment the fight led pennsylvania to adopt one of the countrys toughest antitakeover laws and ultimately cost the wouldbe acquirers about  million in losses the year continued with a second moneylosing run at the asda group plc a british retail chain in addition the company announced last fall that it was taking huge losses on its securities portfolio and would shut down its trading operations then run by marc belzberg samuels son those setbacks have cost the family dearly at recent market prices the three brothers combined stock holdings in the parent company are worth about  million canadian a nice sum but less than a third of what the stakes were worth at the high and according to one analyst in vancouver british columbia tony yue of goepel shields  partners the parent company has essentially given back in the last  months the money it made speculating in takeover stocks in the s the company acknowledged yesterday that the last year had been trying first city financial has experienced a significant erosion in shareholder value over the last year and faces a very difficult year of asset restructuring and debt refinancing brent belzberg said in the statement the transition which calls for brent to assume the title of chief executive from his uncle was decided at a first city board meeting on thursday in toronto and is effective immediately brent will also pick up the chief executive title at first city trustco and keep his titles as chief executive of first city trust the operating unit of trustco and of first city development samuel will remain chairman of the parent company the moves following the companys decision last fall to close the new york trading operation an office that speculated on takeover stocks signal a further retreat for the belzberg family from the takeover business that has shaped much of its dealings over the last decade and an effort to refocus on its two core operating companies it reflects the strategic changes that are going on and just confirms that the company is not going to be involved in takeovers and securities transactions in the future said eric w evans first city spokesman the intention is to be strictly a holding company for those two businesses brent alone of the familys second generation has held significant management positions at both operating companies which may have favored him over other contenders analysts and others close to the family said yesterday a lawyer who graduated from the university of toronto he spent a few years practicing securities law at tory tory deslauriers  bennington a canadian law firm before joining the family business mr evans said sam made a decision that was best for the company and for the shareholders said byron menides a worcester mass executive who has served on the board of a belzbergcontrolled company marc is very good at what he does but for all the time ive known him hes not been used as a manager so brent is the logical successor while brents younger brother murray is expected to continue as an executive in the first city trust marcs future with the company is less clear once he finishes shutting down the new york trading office he wont actively be involved in the business because there really isnt a role given the change in direction of the company mr evans said first city financials stock closed yesterday at  up  cents photos brent s belzberg left to whom samuel belzberg is surrendering daytoday control of the first
