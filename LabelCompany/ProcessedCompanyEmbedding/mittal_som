steelmaking process makes good business sense as well as reducing the environmental impact we try to use all the materials produced during the process of steelmaking whether they are prime steel products or materials commonly seen as waste arcelormittal’s shared services team coordinates sales of byproducts from the steelmaking process with the aim of generating revenue from these products as well as making good business sense making the most of the byproducts of steelmaking is the right thing to do in terms of material stewardship by recycling as much as possible and minimising the impact of steelmaking on the environment through their work on byproducts the shared services team drives collaboration between arcelormittal’s mills and customers byproducts include all forms of slag from both integrated and mini mills in granulated or ground form tar and tar distillates benzole ammonium sulphate mill scales and sludges coke breeze and various dusts collected throughout the various steel production stages we also operate a number of slag dumps which were accumulated before arcelormittal owned various steel plants these may be rich in iron and carbonbearing materials and can be reused in our steelmaking facilities this lowers the need to buy materials reducing the company’s external material and supply chain footprint related information recycling our waste arcelormittal

products include a broad range of flat long and tubular products to serve the automotive construction energy appliance container and machinery markets more than  percent of arcelormittal’s raw steel production in the us is from flat operations which are primarily integrated facilities all of our products are available in standard carbon grades as well as highstrength lowalloy grades for more demanding applications flat products hotrolled all coiled flatrolled steel is initially hotrolled by passing a slab through a multistand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than ⁄ inch hotrolled steel destined for the sheet market can be either shipped as black band or cleaned in an acid bath and sold as pickled band these products are used in noncritical surface applications such as automotive frames and wheels construction products pipe offhighway equipment and guardrails coldrolled coldrolled sheet is hotrolled coil that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel further processing through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves ductility and formability coldrolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures coldrolled sheet is used in among other things steel applications that demand higher surface quality such as exposed automobile and appliance panels coldrolled sheet prices are usually higher than hotrolled steel prices for certain applications coldrolled sheet is coated or painted coated either hotrolled or coldrolled coil may be coated with zinc aluminum or a combination thereof to render it corrosion resistant hotdip galvanized galvannealed galvalume electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steel these are also among the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and usually have the strictest quality requirements coated steel products are generally used in applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings and grain bins plate plate is steel that is generally more than ⁄ inch thick it can be made on either a coiled plate mill up to oneinch thick or a discrete plate mill the coiled plate or discrete plate is then cut into sections for specific end uses commodity steel plate is used in a variety of applications such as storage tanks ships and railcars large diameter pipe and machinery parts more specialized steel plate such as highstrength lowalloy heattreated or alloy plate can have superior strength and performance characteristics for particular applications such as the manufacture of construction mining and logging equipment pressure vessels and oil and gas transmission lines and the fabrication of bridges and buildings quenched and tempered plate is harder and stronger and can be used in products such as military armor and hard rock mining equipment tin tin mill sheet steel is used to produce food packaging and other containers it is available as black plate tin plate and tinfree steel black plate is an uncoated thin gauge coldrolled steel tin plate is black plate electrolytically plated with metallic tin and tinfree steel is black plate that has been electrolytically plated with metallic chromium and chromium oxides both tin plate and tinfree steel undergo a plating process whereby the molecules from the positively charged tin or chromium anode attach to the negatively charged sheet steel the thickness of the coating is readily controlled through regulation of the voltage and speed of the sheet through the plating area long products rail billets and blooms are fed through rollers that form rail rail is produced in a number of sections determined by their weight per yard and relative strengths rail is sold to railroad companies and regional transit authorities for new track projects and for the repair of existing track tubular products specialty steel tubing apart from welded and seamless steel tubes available in a wide spectrum of carbon and alloy grades tubular product solutions can also be tailored to meet the specific needs of customers through an extensive range of services including cutting end finishing heat treating and steel slitting there are also drawnovermandrel dom and cold drawing capabilities available for the most demanding applications tubular products serve a variety of markets including automotive industrial and construction equipment hydraulic cylinders agricultural equipment and mineral mining equipment welded products tailor blanks tailored blanks play a significant role in providing “tailor made” solutions to automotive customers a tailored blank which can be a straight line or curvilinear product is created by laser welding together steels of various grades thicknesses andor different coatings tailored blanks help improve the performance of car parts in a vehicle while reducing weight and enhancing safety
