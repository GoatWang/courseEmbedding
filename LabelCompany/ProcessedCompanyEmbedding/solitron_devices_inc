annual sales and a staff of  employees mr saraf also held executive positions with photofabrication technology inc and measurements group of vishay intertechnology inc technology semiconductor equipment  materials sodiotc bb solitron devices inc  electronics way west palm beach fl  phone    interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfointerviewscom published  november   ceocfo mr saraf solitron has a long history what is the focus and vision today mr saraf our focus is to continue supporting the aerospace and the defense industry   ceocfo would you tell us about your products and what is unique about what solitron mr saraf we are producing power semiconductors and power hybrids that are utilized in the defense and aerospace industries for example our product has been used on the robot spacecrafts that are roaming mars our hybrids were used originally to drive the lunar rover the jeep the astronauts used for traveling on the surface of the moon our products are used in satellites and missile systems like amrram which is an advanced mediumrange missile used by the us air force and many other western air forces it has been used on arrow which is the antimissile missile that was developed jointly by israel and the united states it is used on other missiles like hellfire that is being used by the us air force extensively in iraq and afghanistan our hybrids are also used in the radar systems of the f f f and f   ceocfo why is your product superior mr saraf it is the manufacturing technology we make our products in hermetically sealed packages that withstand extreme temperatures pressure and vibration   ceocfo i know that you do custom work and you have been a pioneer in innovative design what is an example of something you have worked on and what are you able to do to make a difference in the project mr saraf there is a custom product that we are producing for an unnamed major defense contractor for an advanced fighter and what is unique about it is that it is the worlds smallest thinnest lightest dc to dc converter in a hermetically sealed package nobody else has been able to make it in this constrains of the physical envelope   ceocfo what gives you the edge mr saraf the knowhow of the team of people that have been doing it since the mids   ceocfo solitron recently received the as rev b certification would you tell us about the new certification and how that enhances what you offer mr saraf major defense contractors like lockheed martin hamilton sundstrand boeing l and raytheon are requiring the as increasingly and it is used for aerospace applications it demands stricter documentation production and quality control standards it is an offspring of iso which is now required worldwide   ceocfo where do you do the manufacturing mr saraf we do our manufacturing in west palm beach florida   ceocfo what is the level of competition in your industry mr saraf the number of our competitors is shrinking because major and medium size companies have increasingly been leaving the defense and aerospace area this is because the volume of business is not there to justify the cost of the additional certification and quality system in place thus for us it has opened up additional opportunities which have been vacated by other companies   ceocfo so it is a good time for solitron mr saraf yes it is   ceocfo would you tell us about your ten golden rules of premiere customer service mr saraf the rules speak for themselves bottom line is a company can excel and attract new business when its reputation is based on quality of its product and the quality of its service service and quality in many cases are what set companies apart   ceocfo what is the financial picture like at solitron today mr saraf we are financially healthy stable and profitable if you look at our past performance we have a solid record of performance and profitability   ceocfo what do you see the next couple of years down the line mr saraf the fact that because of government plans for the future of the defense and aerospace sectors the number of opportunities large companies are interested in is decreasing because the volume is not attractive to them it has opened new opportunities for small companies like us this affords us the opportunity to move in and fill voids created by large companies leaving the market for example we are now developing custom power semiconductors and hybrids products that have been made by other companies that has obsoleted them stopped making them or gone out of business and therefore created opportunities for us to make these products that we did not make before   ceocfo why should potential investors pay attention mr saraf if they are looking for a company that steadily performs financially they should look at solitron devices they will not find anything flashy that comes and goes with the tide but a company that has a year after year solid performance history and future   ceocfo what might someone miss or not understand when they look at solitron that they should know mr saraf we are small but if you look at our pl and balance sheet and items such as current stock price compare it to our netcash holdings and compare them to market valuation the numbers scream at you that our stock price is under valued   ceocfo final thoughts what should people remember most about solitron mr saraf people should know that we are here to stay and we have supported the defense and aerospace sectors since the s we supported programs like the first trip to the moon now we can see the future trips to the moon mars and beyond disclaimers any reproduction or further distribution of this article without the express written consent of ceocfointerviewscom is prohibited   we

volts the company employs over  types of silicon chips to manufacture approximately  types of power bipolar transistors the company also manufactures power diodes under the same military specification additionally it manufactures power nchannel and pchannel mosfet transistors the company manufactures both standard and custom power transistorshybridsthe company manufactures thick film hybrids which generally contain discrete semiconductor chips integrated circuits chip capacitors and thick film or thin film resistors most of the hybrids are of the highpower type and are custom manufactured for military and aerospace systems some of the companys hybrids include high power voltage regulators power amplifiers power drivers boosters and controllers the company manufactures both standard and custom hybridsvoltage regulatorsvoltage regulators provide the power required to activate electronic components the electronic components include the integrated circuits found in all electronic devices from radar and missile systems to smart phonespower mosfetsthe power mosfets are current controlled and bipolar transistors are voltage controlled mosfets are high input impedance fast switching speed and resistance to thermal runaway and secondary breakdown power mosfets are available in high voltage and current ratingsfield effect transistorsthe company manufactures approximately  different types of junction and mos field effect transistor chips they are used to produce over  different field effect transistor types the company manufactures both standard and custom field effect
