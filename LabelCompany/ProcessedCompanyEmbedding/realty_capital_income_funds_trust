accordingly applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  applicants submit that the proposed structure will not result in the exercise of undue influence by a fund of funds or its affiliated persons over the underlying funds applicants assert that the concern about undue influence does not arise in connection with a fund of funds investment in the affiliated funds because they are part of the same group of investment companies to limit the control a fund of funds or fund of funds affiliate  may have over an unaffiliated fund applicants propose a condition prohibiting the adviser and any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser and any investment company and any issuer that would be an

controlled by or under common control with the subadviser collectively the “subadviser group”  with respect to closedend funds applicants submit that one significant difference from openend underlying funds is that whereas openend underlying funds may be unduly influenced by the threat of largescale redemptions closedend underlying funds cannot be so influenced because they do not issue redeemable securities and therefore are not subject to largescale redemptions on the other hand applicants state that closedend underlying funds may be unduly influenced by a holders ability to vote a large block of stock to address this concern applicants submit that with respect to a funds investment in an unaffiliated closedend investment company i each member of the group or subadviser group that is an investment company or an issuer that would be an investment company but for section c or c of the  act will vote its shares of the unaffiliated closedend investment company in the manner prescribed

result in excessive layering of fees the board of each fund of funds including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the  act the “independent

funds andor underlying uits through redemptions could be deemed to violate section a  section b of the  act authorizes the commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by
