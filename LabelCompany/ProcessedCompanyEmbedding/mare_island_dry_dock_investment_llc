island dry dock llc midd of vallejo california protests the award of a contract to vigor marine llc of portland oregon by the department of the army corps of engineers under request for proposals rfp no wnr for ship repair services midd asserts that the agency’s evaluation of its proposal was unreasonable we deny the protest background the solicitation issued on august   contemplated the award of a fixedprice indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity contract with a year period of performance rfp at  award was to be made to the offeror that submitted the lowestpriced technically acceptable proposal id at  the solicitation established the following nonprice evaluation factors capabilities recent relevant experience safety environmental compliance and past performance rfp at  the capabilities factor included two subfactors pier and wet berth and drydock id the solicitation provided that a proposal would be deemed acceptable only if it was evaluated as meeting all of the minimum requirements specified under the evaluation factors and subfactors see id additionally the solicitation cautioned that “proposals must set forth full accurate and complete information as required by this rfp” and that the “absence of information will be deemed as if no support for that criterion was provided” id at  the solicitation also cautioned that the agency intended to make award without holding discussions id at  under the pier and wet berth subfactor the solicitation listed the following “minimum requirements” a low water level of  feet b  feet between fore and aft tie off kevels c ’” x ’” clear dock working area d documented pounds per square foot load capability e a v ac phase  cycle electrical service with gfci and phase protection rfp at  hence under section d above the solicitation required that proposals include “documented pounds per square foot load capability” for the proposed pier and wet berth the agency received two proposals in response to the solicitationone from midd and one from vigor contracting officer’s statement at  a technical evaluation board teb convened and evaluated the proposals as relevant here the teb found that midd’s proposal failed to include the “documented pounds per square foot load capability” for midd’s proposed pier and wet berth agency report ar tab  midd technical proposal evaluation at   because as stated above this was a minimum requirement under the pier and wet berth subfactor the teb assigned a rating of unacceptable to midd’s proposal under that subfactor id at  after reviewing the teb’s findings the contracting officer who also served as the source selection authority in this procurement directed the contracting specialist to submit a clarification request to midd regarding whether the firm’s proposal included information documenting the pounds per square foot load capability of midd’s proposed pier and wet berth contracting officer’s statement at  thereafter the contracting specialist sent the following communication to midd this email is a request for clarification per far federal acquisition regulation a this e‑mail does not constitute discussions per far b the subject rfp subfactor  pier and wet berth requests for offerors to document pounds per square foot load capability after reading through and evaluating midd’s proposal requested information could not be located for the wet berth pier please identify where in the proposal the information can be found make reference to the applicable tab andor appendix ar tab  agencymidd correspondence at  emphasis in original midd responded by providing a onepage “design memorandum” with the subject line “berth bearing load capacityclarification of appendix i quay wall plans and sections” ar tab  agencymidd correspondence at  the memorandum described the construction of midd’s pier and wet berth including the extensive use of concrete see id the memorandum also provided the load capacity of midd’s proposed pier and wet berth as extrapolated from the “average shear capacity for asphalt concrete” id although it generally referenced appendix i in the subject line the memorandum did not identify any specific information in midd’s proposal providing the pounds per square foot load capability of the proposed pier and wet berth see id after reviewing midd’s submission the contracting specialist informed the firm as follows “unfortunately what has been presented was not in the proposal submitted by midd therefore i cannot accept it” ar tab  agencymidd correspondence at  following these communications a source selection evaluation board sseb prepared a report for the contracting officer ar tab  sseb report the report established the total evaluated price for midd’s proposal as  and the total evaluated price for vigor’s proposal as  id at  however the report designated midd’s proposal as technically unacceptable based on the finding that it failed to meet the requirement for providing a pounds per square foot load capability under the pier and wet berth subfactor id at   vigor’s proposal on the other hand was designated as technically acceptable id at  the contracting officer reviewed the evaluation record and agreed with the sseb’s determination that vigor had submitted the lowestpriced technically acceptable proposal ar tab  source selection decision document at   accordingly the contracting officer selected vigor for award id at  after award was made midd filed a protest with our office discussion midd asserts that the agency’s determination that its proposal was unacceptable under the pier and wet berth subfactor was unreasonable arguing that the agency failed to properly review a drawing in appendix i to the proposal see protest at  comments at  according to midd if the agency had adequately reviewed this drawing it would have determined that the proposal met or exceeded the solicitation’s requirements see protest at  comments at  more particularly midd argues that the drawing depicts the use of concrete in the firm’s pier and wet berth and that concrete “is commonly understood in the commercial sector as providing a minimum of  psf pounds per square foot load capabilities” protest at   comments at  based on this midd asserts that its proposal met or exceeded the solicitation’s requirement for “documented pounds per square foot load capability” of the pier and wet berth for the reasons discussed below we disagree it is an offeror’s responsibility to submit a wellwritten proposal with adequately detailed information which clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency int’l med corps b dec    cpd ¶  at  caci techs inc b‑ oct    cpd ¶  at  a proposal that fails to conform to material terms of the solicitation may be considered unacceptable and not form the basis for an award gordon r a fishman b nov    cpd ¶  at  as stated above the solicitation cautioned that “proposals must set forth full accurate and complete information as required by this rfp” and that the “absence of information will be deemed as if no support for that criterion was provided” rfp at  as also stated above under the pier and wet berth subfactor the solicitation expressly required that proposals include “documented pounds per square foot load capability” of the proposed pier and wet berth id at  the contracting officer explains that the solicitation included this requirement so the agency “could assess the contractor’s knowledge of the load capability of its chosen pier and wet berth” contracting officer’s statement at  the contracting officer further explains that this knowledge is particularly important to determine how to distribute the agency’s equipment when unloading at the contractor’s pier the agency’s equipment is heavy and could be damaged if the pier fails because the weight of the equipment is not distributed properly in light of the load capability of the pier contracting officer’s statement at  it is not apparent from our review of the record that midd’s proposal presented the pounds per square foot load capability of the firm’s proposed pier and wet berth further in its protest and comments on the agency report midd does not cite any specific proposal content that expressly provides the pounds per square foot load capability of the proposed pier and wet berth rather midd in essence argues that the agency should have inferred the pounds per square foot load capability for the proposed pier and wet berth because the drawing in appendix i depicted the use of concrete in the pier and wet berth however the solicitation explicitly called for offerors to provide the pounds per square foot load capacity midd’s proposal failed to provide this information we therefore find the challenged evaluation finding to be reasonable midd also alleges that the agency improperly failed to consider the information provided in the firm’s response to the clarification request protest at  comments at  had the agency considered this information midd argues the firm’s proposal would have been deemed acceptable under the pier and wet berth subfactor protest at  comments at  alternatively midd argues that the agency should have opened discussions with the firm protest at  comments at  we see no merit in these claims as discussed above we find that the agency reasonably determined midd’s proposal to be technically unacceptable on the basis that it did not include documentation of the pounds
