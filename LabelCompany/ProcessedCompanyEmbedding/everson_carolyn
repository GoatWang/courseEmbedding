september  bloomberg women to watch profile and a march  interview in the london evening standard among other coverage like sandberg everson an american who moved to london in december  has a lot to say about women and work she told the evening standard that she has discussed leaning in extensively with sandberg during their years of work together and spoke out about her own views on the subject in the march  interview “i do think women get to a point where they have to love their job and their career everson told the standard it has to be so fulfilling and they have to feel as if they are having impact in order to make the sacrifices they may feel they have to make on the home front women get to a point where if they are not fulfilled in their career the inclination is to stay at home which is totally understandable” in an october  interview with genconnects nancy spears everson stated that her daughters and her husband were her top priority but that its important to teach her children the value of work “i say mommy works because we need to pay the mortgage … i am trying to instill a work ethic in the kids that hopefully will last a lifetime” eversons bloomberg women to

about her professional history and plans for facebooks future everson describes her career more as a jungle gym  a term sandberg also uses  than the traditional corporate ladder if you look back at my career at any given moment i could have stayed on the ladder everson told bloomberg special correspondent and huffington post senior editor willow bay but i actually chose not to do that i chose not to focus on the next promotion or the next opportunity but rather build my toolkit in a  interview with the huffington posts bianca bosker everson revealed that she brings her daughters on at least one business trip per quarter and on the whole aims for worklife integration her rule is to attend every first  first school play first concert or first hockey game bosker reported everson says she is committed to paving the way for women in the workplace and says she hopes that her own daughters will have every option open to them “i want them to believe that they can achieve anything they set out to she told the standard i just want them to know that they have every opportunity to achieve what their dreams are according to her genconnect interview the best piece of advice everson received on having it all came from the senior vp of marketing at cocacola wendy clark who told her think about how your family can be part of your job and vice versa as opposed to trying to divide everything up as for offering her own words of wisdom to other women everson told bosker don’t look at the world as men versus women look at the world as though we’re all on one team everyone has just as much right as everyone else to have a voice to think about career progression to go home and be there for their family including men suggest a correction nina bahadur deputy editor huffpost women more career

branded stories product which lets companies put social activity related to the brand directly into facebook advertisements i ribbed her about how fm has been doing something similar for years but of course fm has about  of facebooks scale there are no shortage of questions to get into with everson including facebooks rumored push into content  something ceo mark zuckerberg implied was inevitable in recent public speeches and then theres the always rumored facesense  a facebookdata driven ad network for third party publishers that would take on googles display business and of course the recent launch of facebook deals a groupon competitor that is super focused on the local advertising marketplace and then theres the question of privacy while zuckerberg has a clear philosophy on the question and most likely its shared by a large percentage of his customers advertisers are usually far more sensitive to how they use data and oddly enough at far larger risk of regulatory backlash and of course privacy laws are not only in flux there are half a dozen or so proposed pieces of legislation in the us alone but they vary greatly from country to country lastly theres the rumored  ipo and with it the pressures of making quarterly numbers as global sales chief that responsibility falls to everson in short there are plenty of things to discuss and thats why ive asked everson to be our last speaker at cm summit so if we go a bit long were not bumping anyone else off the stage let me know if theres anything youd like me to ask her as a reminder well hear from more than  presenters at cm summit  of which will be oneone interviews those include visa cmo antonio lucio our business is digital period the inimitable william embracing brand as an artist googles neal mohan a  billion

scale outlook the company’s top marketing executive describes the social network’s ambitious efforts to forge enduring and meaningful relationships — with employees industry partners and everyone else on earthby deborah bothun and emmanuelle rivet             pdf     photograph courtesy of facebook a version of this article appeared in the autumn  issue of strategybusiness connecting at scale the ability to create meaningful lasting mutually beneficial relationships with a large number of consumers users and employees this business imperative is one of the keys to success and profitability in the entertainment and media world today few companies are forging the depth and scale of connections that facebook is far more than providing a platform for sharing status updates and photos the yearold company has emerged as a conduit for communicating through images instagram  million users and messaging whatsapp  billion users facebook’s core platform where  billion people around the world come together every month has emerged into a vital distribution channel for journalism and a crucial marketing venue for businesses large and small and ceo mark zuckerberg continually pushes the company to replicate and enhance the facebook experience in new realms mobile live video and virtual reality carolyn everson vice president global marketing solutions says connecting at scale is at once a significant competitive advantage a responsibility and a standard to live up to a graduate of villanova with a harvard mba everson gained experience in consulting media zagat primedia viacom and technology microsoft before joining facebook in  her current job has put her at the center of a continuing revolution in sharing connectivity and media consumption and production at facebook’s new york office everson spoke with deborah bothun and emmanuelle rivet of pwc about the unique position facebook occupies in entertainment and media the way its ambitious initiatives serve the company mission of connecting at scale the commitment to help employees lead whole lives and the need to come up with better ways to measure how advertisers and marketers connect with their target audiences bothun facebook has shown an impressive ability to pivot organize and plan — even in an environment that shifts with remarkable speed given the pace of change in the world and in your industry how do you plan on executing on your strategy three to five years from now everson we start almost any strategy discussion with our mission the mission is to make the world more open and connected we believe connectivity is a human right just as much as food shelter and water related stories planning for facebook’s future by peter thies jane stevenson best of multimedia the history of facebook by charity delich advice for facebook that may just help twitter by laura w geller the framework that mark zuckerberg speaks about is increments of time one to three years three to five years five to  years the one to three increment focuses on our existing platforms and improving them that’s where the majority of our resources are still dedicated how do we continue to improve the experience of facebook or instagram every time somebody uses them the threetofiveyear horizon is about getting some of the other platforms to scale and then figuring out a monetization strategy for those that are at scale whatsapp is already at  billion users the fivetoyear period concentrates on our longrange bets which are about increased connectivity although many people are connected we have to realize that twothirds of the world population is unconnected and that part of the world will fall further behind educationally and economically if it remains unconnected bothun what’s the approach for the longrange bets everson we have an umbrella strategy called internetorg which has lots of components there’s free basics which gives people an onramp to the internet at no cost in countries where the poverty line is us per day many people have to decide between feeding their family and paying for data they’re always going to choose feeding their family we want to make free basics available to the billions of people who are not connected about  million people have taken advantage of it we’re finding that within  days many of those who can afford to do so are actually converting to paid data plans once they see the power of the internet bothun how do you market that everson we partner with the local telecommunications companies telecoms are offering free services with the belief that people will become paid subscribers and that is playing out well they’re getting access to very basic services often on g connections see “india’s triple play” by suvarchala narayanan the next billion people who come online will probably do so mostly on feature phones in these markets — simpler phones with very very lowspeed connections we’re also investing in alternative ways of providing connectivity that are less expensive we’re testing an unmanned aircraft named aquila the idea being that it can fly between  and  feet above earth and can beam connectivity down about  miles away and to other unmanned aircraft we plan to launch a satellite in subsaharan africa as well this year bothun but even though this is a longrange bet you’re already working on it everson right it’s not like we’re sitting here saying “we’re going to start that in five years” it is a question of resource allocation and time frames these things could take decades but we’re making a significant bet on artificial intelligence ai and really trying to figure out if machines can both learn and make decisions the way humans do to help facilitate efficiency and allow humans to do higherorder tasks rivet is ai just being used to organize content everson we just announced for example that we now have using artificial intelligence the ability to help blind people on facebook worldwide more than  million people are blind and more than  million have a severe visual impairment when someone who is visually impaired is on facebook ai reads out the compositions of photos like “picture of carolyn with two other people and the sun is shining and it’s a beach” with messenger we’re working on m a virtual assistant it’s early days but we are trying to train m to answer basic inquiries and do things like make reservations order flowers give you information i was in houston for the ncaa tournament and i asked m for information about the space center and it sent me a whole summary there are more than  million businesses on facebook and we have more than  million advertisers that are businesses we could help those businesses answer basic customer service inquiries with m and then there’s oculus the virtual reality unit which offers a different way to experience connectivity but it all ladders to the mission so we are not a company of disparate bets going all over the place rivet yes i want to talk a little bit about oculus where does it fit everson oculus is in more of the fivetoyear bucket right now but the “bucket” framework isn’t ironclad originally for example instagram wasn’t in the onetothreeyear bucket but it developed more rapidly the biggest hurdle to oculus becoming a scaled solution in the market is going to be cost it’s still pricey and the second biggest is that it requires a very powerful pc to run it but as with any technology over time those things will evolve bothun are you looking at enterprise uses for that as well everson i would say that there is probably an application for oculus in almost every industry that you can think of gaming is the one that’s obvious and happening most actively right now the entertainment industry is very focused on oculus and what kind of experiences they could bring to it but we’ve had inquiries from hospitals and physician groups trying to understand if surgeons could be trained in a completely new way it is so realistic i mean you literally feel like you’re being transported into another world you could imagine education applications giving students an opportunity to visit the louvre without ever traveling to france we’ve had a lot of inquiries from retail partners and clients oculus is going to be limited only by imagination bothun when we talk about the company’s overall strategy geographic expansion has to be part of it when you look around the markets where you are not fully penetrated do you have particular focuses for the onetothreeyear or fivetoyear windows everson india is clearly an incredibly important priority about  million people a month access facebook in india and it will become our largest market soon when it surpasses the united states but the population of india is well over a billion and there are a lot of barriers to connectivity there we focus mostly on people we find ways for people to use the platform and the monetization comes later africa is quite important to us again we have north of  million people in africa using facebook on a monthly basis with over  percent on mobile but it’s a drop in the bucket when you consider the population and then of course there’s china and from our perspective we won’t be fulfilling our mission unless we figure out a way to connect people in china bothun and i’m sure you have thought about and considered whether you can partner with anybody there and whether that makes any sense everson we are looking at every alternative and every type of strategy and mark is deeply committed he’s learned mandarin he’s on the board of tsinghua university but there is really no way to say whether or when that’s going to happen bothun it sounds like you have to tailor both connectivity solutions and user experience to different markets — at scale everson right we know that the middle east for example consumes more video than almost any other market and so we are making product changes as a result of both bandwidth challenges and consumer interest in the region we rolled out slideshow which can take a video and consolidate the data usage involved with it and display it almost like flowing images that’s helping us in those markets such as the middle east and india where users are relying on g or feature phones bothun what about people who want to connect with facebook as an employer let’s say i’m a sophomore in college thinking about my major and i really want a future with facebook should i earn an engineering degree should i get a data and analytics background should i make a name for myself at another company before applying everson first facebook can’t hire enough good engineers particularly female engineers and engineers from other underrepresented demographic groups so if i had an interest in engineering and a propensity for that i would pursue that degree regardless of whether i’m trying to get a job at facebook we as a society can’t fill the number of engineering jobs that are open “if we’re not testing for a specific skill like engineering we are very much screening you for our values” at facebook if we’re not testing for a specific skill like engineering we are very much screening you for our values i would say that the things that we mostly look at have to do with impact have you demonstrated a consistent desire are you intellectually curious are you bold are you not afraid of failure are you open and collaborative we need to concentrate on those characteristics because we don’t have a playbook we’re making it all up as we go we take some interns on the business side of facebook but it’s a small group you could start off in a small business team which is mostly in austin texas if you’re in the us or são paulo in brazil without a ton of experience on the team that i’m responsible for we prefer to hire people with five to  years of experience bothun which type of experience everson all different we hire people who have had industry and vertical expertise — travel or consumer products or financial services we hire people from the advertising agency community and from other technology companies we hire people who have done consulting we’ve hired entrepreneurs who have tried to sell or maybe have had success at selling companies if i had to describe an ideal resume it would show some consulting experience some vertical expertise and some technology experience put that all together and then the person has to be really comfortable with rapid pace agility and things changing all the time rivet for the type of people you’ve described there’s a real war for talent so how do you retain people and keep them engaged and continue to be a great destination for experienced people and young people everson we do not make counteroffers right wrong or indifferent we don’t so that means the ability for us to retain people has to be in place before they log off and try to get another offer number one is the mission people who are here and who tend to stay here just deeply believe in the mission and can’t imagine picking up and going somewhere else where the mission seems more trivial or not as clear the environment and the culture of how we operate is another important factor in retaining people we make a list of all the things that people may have experienced in bigger companies and then say “don’t bring any of that in here don’t bring hierarchy don’t bring bureaucracy don’t cover your rear end on decision making don’t bring competitiveness with your colleagues” the third is giving people a real sense of what the future holds we’re  years old some might have said “gee after you go public it’s going to be so hard to recruit people right anyone coming in now has missed the window” and the truth of the matter is by our constant reminder that we’re only  percent done with the journey people know they can join facebook today and feel like they have so much more to do bothun burnout has become a challenge for all companies but particularly for technology companies in this  work environment how do you combat that everson we’re working hard to give people the opportunity to feel that they can have an incredibly successful career at facebook but also lead a highperformance life outside all our jobs are highly demanding we’re trying to avoid burnout average employee retention in companies has gone from  years to five and in technology it’s three we encourage our team members to declare a vision to define what’s important to them within the company as well as personally by doing this we empower people to figure out how to make that balance happen and we hold managers accountable for helping their teams actually live the kind of life they want to lead as a leader i have to care about people having an amazing life outside work just as much as i care about delivering incredible results at facebook bothun that’s a different approach to management and leadership how does it work in practice everson when i do my oneonones every couple of weeks with my team i’m not just asking them about the business i start by asking how they are doing in achieving their vision and what barriers they are struggling with the idea is that once you declare what’s important to you you can prioritize how you spend your day what you’re concentrating on i’ll give you a personal example i had a great conference that i got invited to that was taking place over several days but villanova my alma mater was in the ncaa men’s basketball championship and it was very clear to me that this was a onceinalifetime opportunity for me to experience the tournament with my family i was easily able to make that decision to go to the game because i had outlined in my vision the importance of creating memories with my family someone else’s vision may be that he wants to be healthy and lose weight and exercise more and then when he prioritizes his time he’s clear that if he’s not working out as many times a week as he wanted to he needs to make adjustments i believe company cultures are going to have to dramatically evolve it is because frankly the technology is such that if we don’t modify how we operate in our corporate cultures people will be working  and the burnout rates will be terrible bothun let’s switch gears to talk about mobile facebook’s shift from having essentially no mobile revenues in  to mobile generating  percent of its revenues today has been impressive was that simply a set of tactical moves or the result of an execution of strategy everson the shift that we had to make to mobile was vital for us to survive and stay relevant mobile was that much of a threat it was right around the time we went public more people started using facebook on their mobile device instead of on their desktop and suddenly the revenue lines crossed that was a big wakeup call our mobile product at that time was not good we had made a bet on html for scaling purposes which meant that we did not build really good data for ios or android apps and mark called the company together to do an allhands meeting which he typically does several times a year and declared that we had to be not only “mobile first” which we weren’t but “mobile best” yes the story is true that somebody walked into his conference room and showed him a product mockup on a desktop and mark ended the meeting abruptly everyone canceled their meetings with him for two weeks after that because no one had mobile first but that change was perfectly in keeping with our strategy the first priority in the shift to mobile was to get the consumer experience right there was no discussion about monetization initially we had to retrain all the engineers they had to rebuild native apps on ios and android and rise from very poor ratings in the app store to much higher scores then once we understood what the consumer behavior was — at that time consumers were spending most of their time in our news feed — we made news feed the “real estate” for monetization next we needed to think about how to get an ad into news feed that would feel organic or native and be great for the consumer and drive the business result bothun so even though facebook had an established advertising business for desktop the connectivity and user experience preceded the monetization everson yes we are constantly refining our ad unit offerings within news feed last year we developed carousel which lets people scroll horizontally and opened new real estate and new capabilities for advertisers the next big development is canvas which is more like a door that opens up and offers immersion and interactive capabilities now that doesn’t mean the market suddenly decides to start buying this just because we made it so there’s an ongoing effort to educate and inspire and teach the market how to take advantage of the mobile opportunity i talk about the shift to mobile day in and day out consumers are spending more time on mobile than they are on television these days depending on the demographic they may check their phone  to  times a day a business that doesn’t think about how to build mobile presence will be irrelevant bothun how do you use all the data you’re gathering from this activity to personalize the experience for the user everson we talk a lot about peoplebased marketing and the notion there is simply that the smartphone is the most personal device consumers have ever had consumers’ expectations for marketing are that you show up to be useful to delight or entertain or to create some kind of emotion — but you show up for a good reason so we need to get the most relevant marketing in front of consumers because if the consumers don’t like what they’re seeing they could spend less time on facebook or instagram and that would be detrimental to the whole business so we utilize a lot of data sometimes it’s just our own data how consumers are experiencing facebook where they spend more time what stories are of greater interest i mean thousands of data points go into the algorithm to try to serve up the right content sometimes it is our data combined with a marketer’s data we have a product called custom audiences whether you’re a credit card company like mastercard or american express or a car company like toyota or bmw your customers expect you to know that they are using your products and that means you have to show up with ads that acknowledge that rivet increasingly it seems that the relevant content consumed and discovered on facebook will be video everson as much as mobile was a major pivot for this company mark says video could even be bigger we’ve had a bunch of announcements about live which allows users to stream live video you can afford every consumer — any business any celebrity any athlete anyone — the opportunity to communicate in the most authentic manner possible you can show live to just one person or you can show it publicly to the world live frankly surprised us in both how fast it’s growing and how widely it’s been adopted we saw some incredible data about how people are consuming discovering and engaging with video content pulls out a tablet to show map of where people are on facebookcomlivemap live attracts  times the user comments that normal video gets bothun what in general does facebook see as competitive threats everson the way we answer this question and i really believe it’s a sincere answer is that our biggest threat is ourselves if we don’t execute if we become too complacent then we will be replaced when you leave our campus which used to be the headquarters of sun microsystems you can see the old sun sign it’s a reminder to everyone that if you get complacent you can wind up in trouble — because sun was really a successful company at some point we have things called hard conversations and we ask people all the time “what’s the last hard conversation you had” because our belief is that as companies get bigger people tend to be less willing to have the hard conversation and if you look at companies that fail it’s not like they sat there one day and suddenly said “oh god our business is gone” people knew they were afraid to bring it up for fear of punishment or insulting somebody or whatever reason bothun let’s talk about metrics for a minute because that is such a huge issue today how can the clients who are paying the bills measure the return on investment that they’re making everson we think the metrics have to change dramatically we think the media industry is measuring the wrong things they’re measuring impressions clickthroughs and video views and we believe there needs to be a massive shift to value what i mean by value is actually measuring things that drive business value let’s say you have a really cheap cost per thousand audience members cpm you’re just buying really cheap media but if it’s not driving your business it doesn’t matter i tell clients all the time “don’t give us a single dollar unless we’re actually driving your business” in a simplistic way and i’m really oversimplifying “driving your business” means we’re driving actual sales product off the shelf cars off the lot ecommerce whatever it is or we are driving longterm brand metrics that will eventually tie back to sales if you’re not doing those two things — driving sales and driving metrics that lead to sales — and measuring them i really think you’re doing the wrong thing i think this shift is going to take years the systems that tell us what we buy and sell and how the whole marketing industry and ecosystem works are all in the dark ages and we think that all media needs to be held accountable bothun i want to end by asking you about something that doesn’t have to do with measuring profits but is essential to the company’s culture philanthropy how does philanthropy fit into the company’s mission and its people strategy everson mark’s belief is that we need to deliver more social good in the world than the benefits that we’ve received from the markets what we have done in the last few years i think is start to realize the power of what facebook can do in the world for social good so we don’t have a foundation that writes checks our strategy instead is how can we let ngos nonprofits and so on use the benefit of the platform to potentially raise money that’s one pillar of it another is the way we connect to employees and their interests outside facebook every month facebook’s  employees are given an allotment of ad credits that they can use toward any organization they like that’s really empowering and we do hacks with nonprofits a member of my team in canada is really passionate about alzheimer’s and dementia he wrote in his vision two years ago that he was going to host the world’s largest dementia hack and he rallied the right resources in the company the right external interests and hosted the world’s largest dementia hack at the end of  see httphackernestcomdementiahack so you’ve got everything from employees using ad credits and employees thinking boldly at an individual level to those at the global level thinking about how we can turn the power of having more than a billion people a day on our platform into social good in some way shape or form reprint no  author profiles deborah bothun leads pwc’s global entertainment and media
