of progressive changes in telemedicine healthcare policyjuly    by biotricity redwood city calif july   globe newswire — biotricity inc otcqbbtcy a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative biometric remote monitoring solutions acknowledges the importance of telemedicine by announcing its support of the proposed changes in healthcare policy and its expansion into healthcare practices biotricity believes that the rise of telemedicine at the federal and state levels points to a healthcare shift that promotes remote care delivery this direction could create opportunities for remote patient monitoring solutions that can be integrated within telemedicine the nationwide telehealth coverage bill called the medicare telehealth parity act of  is one of several new federal bills currently under consideration designed to introduce an incremental though significant expansion of coverage for telehealth services under the medicare program the bipartisan act is sponsored by representative mike thompson dca with seven cosponsors to date if enacted in its current form it could modernize the way medicare reimburses telehealth services by expanding the number of qualifying geographic locations and expanding coverage of telehealth services this would all take place in a series of three phases this bill joins a growing list of telemedicinefriendly legislation on capitol hill including the connect for health act of  the chronic care act of  the hallways to health act the furthering access to stroke telemedicine fast act and the telehealth innovation and improvement act at the state level in may  texas was the final state to abolish the requirement that patientphysician relationships be established with an inperson visit before implementing telemedicine biotricity’s remote patient monitoring device platform aligns with telemedicine and can be integrated with telehealth solutions the company’s flagship product the bioflux solution is a remote patient monitoring rpm device for physicians to diagnose individuals with cardiovascular disease the solution could be leveraged through telemedicine to support virtual healthcare delivery for cardiac patients with medically relevant realtime data collection and feedback biotricity has already begun working with dr nayyar razvi an advisor to the company with substantial experience in telemedicine who has seen over  patients using this approach “remote patient monitoring solutions will help to substantially expand telemedicine use cases today telemedicine is limited in scope because physicians lack complete insight into the patient’s condition devices that can transmit medically relevant patient information such as biometrics will help provide a more clinically accurate view of the patient” states dr razvi “delivering virtual care so the quality of care remains equivalent or better than a physical visit will be the holy grail of telemedicine something that will likely be delivered by integrating remote monitoring devices” dr razvi has helped drive progress in telemedicine through his work at sheridan college where he has put together a degree program for individuals to become a certified telemedicine assistant and at bayshore where he helped introduce remote telemedicine for wound care “training environments like sheridan and innovative healthcare organizations like bayshore are perfect places for testing and integrating solutions like biotricity’s bioflux for use in telemedicine” he explains “i look forward to working with biotricity to see how we can leverage their technology in our existing work” “the legislative progress towards telemedicine is an excellent driver of health technology innovation and more importantly improves patient care for all individuals” explains biotricity ceo and founder waqaas alsiddiq “with more freedom integrating telemedicine technologies into healthcare delivery is simplified driving down costs and facilitating widespread access to care—especially remote care” about biotricity inc biotricity is a modern medical technology company focused on

change that will improve patient outcomes and curb healthcare costs more than half of adults in the us suffer from at least one chronic disease and almost onethird have multiple chronic conditions seven of the top ten causes of death in the us are chronic diseases with cardiovascular disease alone responsible for  of all deaths in most cases these conditions are preventable through lifestyle changes however the hard reality with which doctors contend every day is that the effects of these conditions often manifest too gradually for people to recognize it falls to the healthcare system to deal with these diseases after they’ve advanced to a serious stage often at great financial cost it was recently estimated that  of all healthcare spending in the us goes to the treatment of those with chronic diseases us adults with at least one chronic diseasenumber of chronic diseases in list of top  causes of deathhealthcare dollars spent on chronic diseasesit is therefore vital to develop technology that enhances doctors’ ability to detect and diagnose these conditions—and to do so early enough for treatments to have their greatest effect it is also crucial to follow that up with personal devices that provide feedback reinforcing patients’ adherence to doctors’ instructions after diagnosis achieving these twin goals is biotricity’s mission with the development of our bioflux

news service  redwood city calif july   globe newswire  biotricity inc otcqbbtcy a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative biometric remote monitoring solutions acknowledges the importance of telemedicine by announcing its support of the proposed changes in healthcare policy and its expansion into healthcare practices biotricity believes that the rise of telemedicine at the federal and state levels points to a healthcare shift that promotes remote care delivery this direction could create opportunities for remote patient monitoring solutions that can be integrated within telemedicine the nationwide telehealth coverage bill called the medicare telehealth parity act of  is one of several new federal bills currently under consideration designed to introduce an incremental though significant expansion of coverage for telehealth services under the medicare program the bipartisan act is sponsored by representative mike thompson dca with seven cosponsors to date if enacted in its current form it could modernize the way medicare reimburses telehealth services by expanding the number of qualifying geographic locations and expanding coverage of telehealth services this would all take place in a series of three phases this bill joins a growing list of telemedicinefriendly legislation on capitol hill including the connect for health act of  the chronic care act of  the hallways to health act the furthering access to stroke telemedicine fast act and the telehealth innovation and improvement act at the state level in may  texas was the final state to abolish the requirement that patientphysician relationships be established with an inperson visit before implementing telemedicine biotricity’s remote patient monitoring device platform aligns with telemedicine and can be integrated with telehealth solutions the company’s flagship product the bioflux solution is a remote patient monitoring rpm device for physicians to diagnose individuals with cardiovascular disease the solution could be leveraged through telemedicine to support virtual healthcare delivery for cardiac patients with medically relevant realtime data collection and feedback biotricity has already begun working with dr nayyar razvi an advisor to the company with substantial experience in telemedicine who has seen over  patients using this approach “remote patient monitoring solutions will help to substantially expand telemedicine use cases today telemedicine is limited in scope because physicians lack complete insight into the patient’s condition devices that can transmit medically relevant patient information such as biometrics will help provide a more clinically accurate view of the patient” states dr razvi “delivering virtual care so the quality of care remains equivalent or better than a physical visit will be the holy grail of telemedicine something that will likely be delivered by integrating remote monitoring devices” dr razvi has helped drive progress in telemedicine through his work at sheridan college where he has put together a degree program for individuals to become a certified telemedicine assistant and at bayshore where he helped introduce remote telemedicine for wound care “training environments like sheridan and innovative healthcare organizations like bayshore are perfect places for testing and integrating solutions like biotricity’s bioflux for use in telemedicine” he explains “i look forward to working with biotricity to see how we can leverage their technology in our existing work” “the legislative progress towards telemedicine is an excellent driver of health technology innovation and more importantly improves patient care for all individuals” explains biotricity ceo and founder waqaas alsiddiq “with more freedom integrating telemedicine technologies into healthcare delivery is simplified driving down costs and facilitating widespread access to care—especially remote care” about biotricity incbiotricity is a modern medical technology company focused on delivering innovative remote biometric monitoring solutions to the medical and

that requirement there are several additional steps that are required before biotricity can formally begin the process   pursuing a national listing is a critical step for the company because it believes that listing on a national securities exchange will result in greater liquidity a higher profile and a larger following among analysts and the public given the recent submission of the final k application for its bioflux product biotricity believes this is the right time to begin this effort the company has already engaged donohoe advisory to guide them through this process biotricity

diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company dedicated to delivering innovative biometric remote monitoring solutions today announced it has received ethics approval to conduct a study that will investigate and validate a mobile wireless fetal heart rate variability hrv monitor achieving ethics approval to conduct a clinical investigation is a significant accomplishment as the responsible institution must review the entire project from design methodology risk goals and other factors before proceeding the study will be conducted at rockyview general hospital by dr david liepert the director of quality assurance and improvement for department of anesthesia and dr reed ferber an associate professor in the faculty of kinesiology and the director and chief scientific officer of the running injury clinic both are accomplished professionals and members of biotricity’s scientific and medical advisory board dr reed is a worldrecognized expert in sensors and signal processing and dr liepert’s work with wearable technology clinical medicine and patient safety will be invaluable as the company investigates the prenatal monitoring sphere about the studyearly and consistent prenatal care improves the chances of a healthy pregnancy for both mother and child prenatal monitoring helps physicians and other caregivers to better control existing conditions in the mother such as high blood pressure and diabetes and help avoid serious complications in pregnancy from other disorders such as preeclampsia regular monitoring reduces the infant’s risk for complications as well making unforeseeable risks more predictable manageable and potentially preventable mobile wearable systems for fetal ecg recording will allow for realtime and reallife evaluation of both the baby’s and mother’s status an electrical sensing ecg monitor provides a higher sampling rate than conventional techniques this allows for a higher level of heart rate variability processing and automation which can help differentiate artifacts from the heart rates of both the mother and the baby this enhanced accuracy could further help save lives and improve the overall quality of prenatal care “estimating the heart rate variability prebirth is a natural progression for biotricity whose main goal in this sphere is to research future medical devices that are easy to implement in both the physician’s office and the patient’s home that are comfortable and small and that can offer precise remote data and care” said waqaas alsiddiq founder and ceo of biotricity “we are extremely excited to receive ethics approval and look forward to building on the research of our flagship product bioflux which is a highly accurate clinicalgrade remote patient monitoring device

challenge is immense but so is the opportunity for transformative change that will improve patient outcomes and curb healthcare costs more than half of adults in the us suffer from at least one chronic disease and almost onethird have multiple chronic conditions seven of the top ten causes of death in the us are chronic diseases with cardiovascular disease alone responsible for  of all deaths in most cases these conditions are preventable through lifestyle changes however the hard reality with which doctors contend every day is that the effects of these conditions often manifest too gradually for people to recognize it falls to the healthcare system to deal with these diseases after they’ve advanced to a serious stage often at great financial cost it was recently estimated that  of all healthcare spending in the us goes to the treatment of those with chronic diseases us adults with at least one chronic diseasenumber of chronic diseases in list of top  causes of deathhealthcare dollars spent on chronic diseasesit is therefore vital to develop technology that enhances doctors’ ability to detect and diagnose these conditions—and to do so early enough for treatments to have their greatest effect it is also crucial to follow that up with personal devices that provide feedback reinforcing patients’ adherence to doctors’ instructions after diagnosis achieving these twin goals is biotricity’s mission with the development of our bioflux and biolife systems we’re tackling cardiovascular disease we will move forward from there applying our proven expertise in remote medical monitoring to the development of professional and personal systems that will aid in the fight against other chronic diseases as well  hardware k clearance pending return
