will resign from the central bank’s board at the end of march giving president obama yet another chance to leave his stamp on the fedin an unusual move mr warsh  had publicly expressed skepticism about the fed’s  billion plan begun in november to buy bonds to lower longterm interest rates and stimulate bank lendinghe was the only one of the fed governors who are presidentially appointed to voice such doubts though he never voted against the plan a former aide to president george w bush he was the only governor with close ties to republicans in congress and to conservative organizations like the hoover institutionwith his departure the fed board loses that link to conservatives at a time when conservative economists and some republicans on capitol hill are sharply critical of the fed chairman ben s bernanke and his policies advertisement continue reading the main story the central bank looks to be increasingly dominated by socalled doves who emphasize policies intended to create jobs and economic growth equally with fighting inflation rather than those known as hawks for whom stable prices and low inflation are paramount continue reading the main story advertisement continue

awaiting senate confirmation to the only vacancy on the boardmr warsh a former specialist in mergers and acquisitions at morgan stanley helped manage the fed’s response to the  financial crisis playing a crucial role in the decisions to broker the sale of bear stearns to jpmorgan chase to allow lehman brothers to go bankrupt and to bail out the american international group he joined the fed board five years ago after serving in the white housemark w olson a former fed governor who overlapped with mr warsh for several months in  said mr warsh’s departure would leave a gap “one thing the fed needs to understand is the perspective of wall street and kevin brought that in a way that nobody else did at that point” he said “kevin’s real value was to help us understand what the capital

extraordinarily easy monetary policy is justified but some conservatives say that mr bernanke might be setting the stage for future inflation and asset bubbles mr warsh served at times as a liaison between mr bernanke and those conservative criticsin a statement mr bernanke praised mr warsh for “exemplary service” and “intimate knowledge of financial markets and institutions” he added “i deeply

mr warsh has at times tried to keep his distance from mr bernanke five days after the fed’s policymarking arm voted on nov  to buy  billion in treasury securities — the second round of a strategy known as quantitative easing that is intended to lower longterm interest rates — the wall street journal published an article by mr warsh expressing doubtthough mr warsh voted for the bondbuying plan — by fed tradition board members almost never vote against the chairman — he said he viewed the strategy as “necessarily limited circumscribed and subject to regular review” he added “policies should be altered if certain objectives are satisfied purported benefits disappoint or potential risks threaten to materialize”the piece was seen in some quarters as presaging his departureofficials said mr warsh a lawyer would return to new york where his wife jane lauder lives and work in the private sector he declined to comment on thursdayrandall s kroszner who served with mr warsh on the board remarked on the significant shift in economic conditions since they started together“when kevin and i had our confirmation hearing together almost exactly five years ago valentine’s day  neither of us could have envisaged the historic challenges the fed was soon to face” said mr kroszner an economist at the university of chicago business school “the crucial issue at the time was to rein in inflation but a key challenge of the crisis a couple of years later was to prevent a japanstyle collapse and deflation” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page

march   market liquidity definitions and implications thank you to the institute of international bankers for inviting me to speak about liquidity in us financial markets certainly trading activity in recent days has brought additional attention to the subject of market liquidity it is not my purpose however to opine on these very recent market movesa comprehensive understanding of which may depend on consequent market developments and the fullness of time i would only note that while premiums on riskier assets rose some last week markets are functioning well amid higher volatility market discipline appears effective as investors are reviewing their positions and overall liquidity does not appear to be in short supply the balance of my remarks will focus on financial market liquidity from a somewhat broader and longerterm perspective in recent quarters we witnessed very strong credit markets bulging pipelines for leveraged loan and highyield bond issuance and nearrecord low credit spreads structured fixedincome products proliferated and the investor universe expanded to match new supply global investment flows were proven noteworthy for the lack of homecountry bias managers of private pools of capitalin all of its forms private equity firms alternative asset management companies hedge funds and investment banksincreased funding from many sources and through many structures due in no small measure to strong credit markets leveraged transactions increased and the market for corporate control became increasingly robust fund managers of private pools of capital seized upon this opportunity to acquire morepermanent sources of capital extending lockup periods using retail platforms and coinvestment funds to increase stickiness of contributed capital securing greater financing flexibility from prime brokers accessing the private placement markets and selling public shares of limited and general partnership interests to new investors to name just a few key questions remain is liquidity at strong and sustainable levels justified by economic fundamentals what is likely to be the liquidity trend going forward in todays remarks i will first propose a definition of market liquidity based on what i believe is its most fundamental characteristic i will then discuss the primary sources of liquidity in the us capital markets and attempt to interpret signals from financial asset prices in this environment i will conclude by discussing implications for the economy and policymakers liquidity what is itthe traditional concept of liquidity relates to trading an assets liquidity is defined by its ability to be transformed into another asset without loss of value this definition is sufficiently general to encompass many ideas some assets such as money are used to trade goods and services without diminution in value and therefore are highly liquid indeed when different measures of the money supply were established it was with an eye toward determining the liquidity of the underlying assets as an example components of m were considered more liquid than those in m it is in this sense that some observers view the stock of money as a measure of liquidity and changes in these measures as roughly equivalent to changes in liquidity i doubt however that traditional monetary aggregates can adequately capture the form and structure of liquidity many observe in the financial markets today instead market observers are more likely to be referring to liquidity in broader terms incorporating notions of credit availability fund flows asset prices and leverage as noted liquidity in the sense of trading liquidity reflects the ability to transact quickly without exerting a material effect on prices liquidity is optimally achieved when myriad buyers and sellers are ready and willing to trade the trading is enhanced by marketmakers and speculators alike underlying this concept is that while buyers and sellers have different views on the most likely outcomesthat is after all what generates tradingthey largely can agree on the distributions of possible outcomes for which they demand riskbased compensation consider liquidity then in terms of investor confidence liquidity exists when investors are confident in their ability to transact and where risks are quantifiable moreover liquidity exists when investors are creditworthy when considered in terms of confidence liquidity conditions can be assessed through the risk premiums on financial assets and the magnitude of capital flows in general high liquidity is generally accompanied by low risk premiums investors confidence in risk measures is greater when the perceived quantity and variance of risks are low this view highlights both the risks and rewards of liquidity the benefits of greater liquidity are substantial through higher asset prices and more efficient transfer of funds from savers to borrowers historical episodes indicate however that markets can become far less liquid due to increases in investor risk aversion and uncertainty while policymakers and market participants know with certainty that these episodes will occur they must be humble in their ability to predict the timing scope and duration of these periods of financial distress recall the market turmoil related to events in asian financial markets in  and following the russian bond default in the summer of  investors flocked to ontherun treasuries and risk spreads for highyield corporate and emerging market bonds spiked chairman greenspan described these episodes as an apparent collapse in investors understanding of possible future risks despite what appeared to be mild imbalances which led to disengagement by traders therefore i wish to advance a simple proposition liquidity is confidence that is powerful liquidity in the us capital markets is evidenced when the economic outcomes are believed to be benign when the tail outcomes are either highly improbable or at the very least subject to reasonably precise measurement the conditions are ripe for liquidity to be plentiful when fund flows are strong and growing there is little reason to expect trading positions to become inalienable my goal in proffering this proposition is to improve the discourse by reducing the different notions of liquidity to its most fundamental feature this exercise may also serve as a healthy reminder if unmoored from fundamentals confidence can give way to complacency complacency can undermine market discipline and liquidity can falter unexpectedly if to the contrary confidence is justified by real economic determinants liquidity can flourish of course some might disagree with this definition of liquidity they may argue that any excess liquidity in financial markets results from too little capital investment here and abroad which may arise from a lack of confidence in future economic outcomes for example high cash balances at us corporations can be interpreted as indicating a lack of confidence in investment prospects previously however i argued that while the buildup of cash since  has been unusual the most pressing determinant was not uncertainty about the profit potential of capital investment instead corporate cash positions are explained more significantly by profits retained at foreign subsidiaries and a sharper focus by investors and ratings agencies on companies abilities to finance shortterm liabilities internally current sources of market liquiditylet me discuss sources of liquidity of the us financial markets by my proposed definition we must ask what forces have increased liquidity read confidence in the united states over the course of the last couple of decades i will turn first to two key drivers of liquidity rapid financial innovation and strong economic performance a third important source of liquidityresulting from the excess savings of emergingmarket economies and those with large commodity reserveshas also found its way to the united states in pursuit of high riskadjusted returns we must judge the extent to which each of these three liquidity drivers are structural or cyclical more persistent or more temporary understanding the sources of liquidityand the causes thereofshould help inform judgments about the level and direction of market liquidity in so doing we may better understand its implications for the economy and policymakers alike first liquidity is significantly higher than it would otherwise be due to the proliferation of financial products and innovation by financial providers this extraordinary growth itself is made possible by remarkable improvements in riskmanagement techniques hewing to my proposed definition we could equally state that financial innovation has been made possible by high levels of confidence in the strength and integrity of our financial infrastructure markets and laws moreover remarkable competition among commercial banks securities firms and other credit intermediaries have helped expand access toand lower the allincost ofcredit interest rate risk and credit risk exposures are now more diversified look no further than dramatic growth of the derivatives markets in just the past four years notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps and options tripled and outstanding credit default swaps surged more than tenfold these products allow investors to hedge and unwind positions easily without having to transact in cash markets expanding the participant pool syndication and securitization also lead to greater risk distribution commercial and industrial ci lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices allowing credit risks to be spread across a greater number of participating banks and nonbank lenders perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of ci loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations closspecial purpose entities that buy ci loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures clos allow loans to be financed primarily with highrated debt securities issued to institutions like mutual funds pension funds and insurance companies indeed in recent years the share of syndicated ci term loans funded by institutional investors is estimated to have exceeded that funded by commercial banks for clo structures to be effective they invariably must include a more risky equity tranche even the most sophisticated financial products are not immune to the physical law of conservation of matterthe risk must rest somewhere hedge funds reportedly have served as willing buyers of these riskier positions and we are all aware of their phenomenal growth now more than  hedge funds hold assets of about  trillion as important as the participation of hedge funds the derivative products themselves allow credit risk to be hedged which has the beneficial effect of further increasing the pool of other investors as well the increase in financial product and provider innovation appears to be quite persistent future trends however are likely to be significantly influenced by legal regulatory and other public policies the second factor perhaps equally persistent supporting strong investor confidence in us markets has been our economys strong macroeconomic performance researchers have documented the socalled great moderation in which the us economy has achieved a marked reduction in the volatility of both real gross domestic product gdp and core inflation over the past twenty years or so in theory reduced volatility if perceived to be persistent can support higher asset valuationsand lower risk premiumsas investors require less compensation for risks about expected growth and inflation in this manner confidence appears to beget confidence with recent history giving some measure of plausibility to the notion that very bad macroeconomic outcomes can be avoided the great moderation however is neither a law of physics nor a guarantee of future outcomes it is only a descriptionan ex post explanation of a period of relative prosperity if policymakers and market participants presume it to be an entitlement it will almost surely lose favor let us look closer at the correlation between confidence and outcomes asset prices do appear somewhat correlated with volatility associated with the real economy and inflation for example equity valuations for us corporations increased more in the past twenty years than in the two decades prior to the great moderation the priceearnings ratio for sp  firms averaged  from  to  and rose to an average of  from  to  in addition term premiums on longterm us treasury securities are estimated to have declined substantially since the late s moreover this decline is significantly associated with a reduction in uncertainty about longrun inflation and about shortterm interest rates third liquidity in us markets also increased significantly in recent years due to increased international capital flows these flows to the united states from global investors lead to higher liquidity by increasing capital available for investment and facilitating greater transfer and insurability of risk a recent report by mckinsey  company estimated that aggregate international capital flows amounted to  trillion in almost triple the volume a decade earlierand that onequarter of the worldwide volume flowed through the united states part of the increased international capital financial flows is a result of excess savings in some emergingmarket and oilexporting countries relative to domestic investmentthe phenomenon chairman bernanke referred to as the global saving glut rapidly aging populations in a few large countries such as china germany and japan generated high savings also some of the fastest growing economies especially in asia pursued exportdriven growth strategies thereby accumulating large reserves of foreigndenominated assets in addition high prices of oil and other commodities in recent years shifted income from importing nations to exporters and research suggests that the bulk of these windfalls has been saved rather than invested on net the savings of less developed countries has been deployed to purchase substantial volumes of financial assets in markets in the most developed nations most notably the united states and the united kingdom estimates from the international monetary fund indicate that the group of the most advanced economies in the world swung from being net purchasers of foreign financial assets on the order of  billion in  to being net sellers of domestic financial assets to foreigners of about  billion in  it is no accident that international excess capital flowed primarily to strong and stable economies and those with highlydeveloped financial markets in a world of funds increasingly without borders we would expect investors to seek out the best riskadjusted returns sound transparent regulatory and legal frameworks in the united states united kingdom and some other advanced economies have helped contribute to the attractiveness of these markets in addition topnotch infrastructure allows for efficient clearance and settlement procedures for transactions in the most sophisticated financial markets all of which promote investor confidence and continued sources of liquidity implications for the economy and challenges for policymakers generally high levels of liquidity offer substantial benefits to our financial system and overall economy through higher financial asset prices and a more efficient means to channel funds between savers and borrowers strong liquidity may also help to prevent imbalances in certain markets from spreading because of the greater dispersion of risks the us economy continues to demonstrate extraordinary resilience no doubt supported by the ability of financial markets to absorb substantial shocks financial markets have been buffeted by a number of significant events including a spate of corporate accounting scandals the bond rating downgrades of ford motor co and general motors corp to speculativegrade status the failure of refco at the time the largest broker on the chicago mercantile exchange and the imposition and pullback of capital controls in thailand but the effects on broader markets appear to have been remarkably contained even the episode last year involving the hedge fund amaranth which accumulated losses of  billion in a few short weeks seemingly had little impact beyond its direct stakeholders it is hard to know with certainty when investors confidence will be stirredbut not shakenby these events it is harder still to know precisely why i have argued that solid fundamentalseffective and dynamic products and markets to disperse risk stable economic performance and robust and attractive market infrastructuresare key underpinnings for strong liquidity and correspondingly strong investor confidence surely policymakers must be vigilant to maintain output stability and low and anchored inflation expectations in addition policymakers need to encourage sound risk management by private participants as the first line of defense against financial instability in particular we should promote policies that encourage stakeholders to engage in ex ante practices protocols and principlesincluding those recently set forth by the presidents working group on financial marketsto accomplish that objective of course investor confidence and liquidity can shift in the aftermath of a financial shock if buyers and sellers of credit can no longer agree on the distribution of possible outcomes their ability to price transactions will be severely limited while we cannotand often should notprevent all shocks or predict how they will reverberate through the financial system we can attempt to create conditions that would lead investors to most quickly rebuild their confidence that is most likely to occur when underlying fundamentals are solid monetary policy is no less challenged by the level and prospects for liquidity we policymakers must ask whether liquidity conditions are obscuring signals from financial asset prices that we would otherwise use to gauge the performance of the real economy liquidity conditions could in theory lead to lowerthanjustified risk premiums that stimulate aggregate demand or otherwise generate excessive inflationary pressures of course inferences from market prices are always imprecise because prices depend on expected growth the variation surrounding that expected path and investor risk aversion none of which we can precisely observe market liquidity may further confound the inference challenges allow me to comment nonetheless on a few key indicators look at the current configuration of treasury yields across the maturity spectrum typically investors require compensation for the greater exposure to interest rate risk from holding longerterm securities leading to an upwardsloping yield curve since about mid the yield curve has been about flat to downwardsloping currently the twoyear rate slightly exceeds the tenyear treasury rate which stands just above  percent a negatively sloped yield curve has in the past served as a reasonably good predictor of economic recessions but there are compelling reasons to suspect that level of liquidity is affecting the slope of the yield curve and lessening its predictive power the same factors that are contributing to liquiditylow uncertainty about inflation and outputare also driving down term premiums and hence longterm treasury yields thus to the extent that low longterm treasury yields and the negative slope of the yield curve reflects a lower term premium rather than a lower expected short rate it is less likely to signal future economic weakness high liquidity could also obscure some information we glean from corporate bond prices what if the current level of liquidity caused lower risk premiums than could be justified by actual credit risks might a misallocation of resources result many commentators have pointed to the low spread of corporate yields relative to treasuries as a sign of investors reaching for yield due to perceived excess liquidity risk spreads however appear less exceptional given the remarkable strength of the corporate sector we can decompose risk spreads for corporate bonds into a series of forward spreads over a sequence of time periods forward spreads include compensation investors require for expected credit losses and a risk premium and it would be reasonable to expect that investors would have a stronger conviction about expected credit losses in the near term than at future horizons currently forward risk spreads one to two years ahead are quite low by historical standards consistent with very liquid balance sheets multidecade low leverage ratios and robust profitability in sharp contrast oneyear forward risk spreads five or ten years ahead are higher relative to their averages of the previous ten years i take some comfort from these implied forward spreads to suggest that investors may not be unduly sanguine about potential credit losses beyond the nearterm of course too much precision cannot be put on assessments of risk premiums this is an area worthy of continued analysis some market participants tell me that the very low bond default rates seen recently realized and expected are themselves a reflection of liquidity that is excess market liquidity may have allowed less than creditworthy firms to refinance their obligations thereby only deferring their financial difficulties other observers note the rise in the second half of last year in the share of new bond issuance that is rated highly speculative and an increase in purchase and debtmultiples for leveraged buyouts suggesting some pickup in risktaking that may be indicative of overconfidence this possibility cannot be ruled out others have pointed to the low levels of stock market volatility in recent months prior to last week as indicative of pressures from excess liquidity naturally one would expect that high levels of liquidity would lead to lower volatility as investors quickly force asset prices back to their fundamental values but recent levels are not unprecedented they were equally low during much of the s and of course volatility itself can be volatile there may be good fundamental reasons for risk and risk premiums to be relatively low and for liquidity and confidence to be reasonably strong even so the pace of change in the capital markets by credit buyers and sellers reminds us to constantly revisit assumptions underlying the financial and economic environment if liquidity conditions and risk premiums of the last several quarters were the sole basis by which to judge the stance of monetary policy it would be hard to conclude that monetary policy has been restrictive of course the assessment of the stance of monetary policy also depends on a variety of other important factors conclusionin summary liquidity has risen significantly with important benefits to our financial system and economy an important source of strength has been financial innovation and while we have yet to see how some new products will play out in a more stressful environment there almost certainly will remain a greater dispersion and insurability of risks stable output and price stability have also been important contributors to liquidity and investor confidence by helping to anchor views about longerterm economic outcomes and solid fundamentals may help to ease any changes in liquidity should they occur hence job number one
