approximate  season  episode  characters featured dickle sfinkter ian previous video im not racist next video my grandpas dirty secret the harry potter pill is a smosh video uploaded on july   the release date of the final harry potter film brief synopsis we bring you the final solution to get over your harry potter depression the infomercial an infomercial spokesperson dickle sfinkter ian and jk rowlings pool boy asks the harry potter fans if they felt like their life was over because the harry potter movie series was over instead of writing crazy fan fiction or buying all their merchandise and waiting for harry to rescue them from their pathetic life they can use the potter pill  a single dose of the potter pill will end all suffering from the black hole that harry potter left in your life it consists of  simple ingredients enriched wheat flour white half vitamin b red half and a leathal dose of cyanide black lightning bolt in the middle it also makes a great gift the scene changes to a pink tie salesman named mike hawksmall he had a coworker that just wouldnt shut up about harry potter so he gave her the potter pill and he hasnt heard from her since then dickle explains how the potter pill works to a paramedic anthony on how it works  place it in your mouth  dont forget to swallow thats what he said and  goodbye cruel world since some kids hate taking pills theres potter pill chewables timmys mother from rejected videos feeds him a potter pill chewable and while timmy starts choking his mom tells him to sleep it also comes in a suppository fashion but you really have to be a really hardcore fan to want one of those its technically fda approved according to fda sr administrator dr drew peacock played by anthony who states with a gun held up to his head and brusies all over his face this product is fda approved most doctors can relate to the effects of the potter pill which is death so a toilet hating doctor dr splashbottom ian says that he just cant endorse this product and instead tells potential custumors they should obsess on another book series and gives an example the twilight saga but gets shot in the head then dickle says and if you dont believe the potter pill will work for you just listen to these satisfied customers the scene changes to a living room full of people the customers who are all dead all order information appears and dickles voice warns to not use the potter pill while operating a motor vehicle or in conjunction with viagra it also states that if you order within the next  minutes you will recieve a fan fiction about harry  dumbledore and dumbledores greatest pickup lines script the harry potter pillscript gallery the harry potter pillgallery triviagoofs in the potter pill chewables scene timmy from rejected videos appears taking the chewable pill when dickle sfinkter says that doctors can relate to this his background is upside down when dickle sfinkter explains to the viewers to listen to their customers one of the hog statues head is replaced with one of a trex during the warning not to use the pill with viagra ians erect penis is censored with bob barkers head a reference to how in the censored version of how to hide a bner in public anthonys erection is similarly censored just like smoshs other fake infomercial videos like easy step easy poop runbrella just like link and others the text that appears at the lower half of the screen during the order infomation has strange details that have very small if not no relation to the product just as the harry potter fangirl imagines harry potter coming into her room you can see a scott pilgrim gets it together poster on her door a split second before it opens dr drew peacock in this video is played by anthony however in im possessed dr drew peacock is played by ian and is an exorcist it is unknown if the dr drew peacock in both videos are the same person despite the different actors playing as him mike hawksmall one of the buyers of the potter pill sounds like my cocks small subscription ending “ click the subscribe button to get a free potter pill and uh whatever you do dont look at that asterisk i cant say asterisk

work for the ultimate finish i would also advocate ians paintwork as an additional service as the quality of his work is great many thanks for your work bryan lightbody kawasaki zx tank     above a happy customer from brussels i have now done  tanks for this customer below a letter to real classic magazine jan  from a happy customer the tank in the picture is not the one i repaired     hello ian just to let you know the sealant worked great on the sunbeam tank and with  applications its all out i used an old hairdryer pointing through through the filler neck to dry the tank out after it had been flushed out with the tpwater  tp i have written a short article recommending your products  given your contact details for a future issue of the sunbeam mcc club news hope this is ok regards robert smith   ian i very reluctantly went down the diy  route with sureseal because of your massive backlog to do the tank for me this was compounded by the fact that my wife had threatened to leave me because of the constant smell of petrol coming from my  t petrol tank that resided in the garage in addition  the local fire crew were constantly turning up to investigate a reported  petrol spillage the instructions were read and your videos studied then the chosen day dawned and the process was executed  it was so simple i used a hot air gun to get the tank up to temperature and the microwave to heat the sureseal wife was out and  days later filled the tank and no leaks  result thoroughly recommend having a go yourself regards jeff   if you would like to share your experience in using the products on this site and other restoration products you have used please email them to me and i will add them to this page please email me at tankcareproductshotmailcom or telephone  monday

producers standard liquid litre price to ppl wwwmilkpricescom     ppl milk price increase for suppliers paynes dairies  from august st    st july  this takes producers standard liquid litre price to ppl wwwmilkpricescom   ppl milk price increase for arla members  from august st   st july  this is actually a  euro cent per kg increase which equates to ppl and results in a standard liquid litre price of ppl and a standard manufacturing litre price of ppl  arlas organic price is a stand on at ppl   ppl milk price increase for suppliers to dairy crest davidstow  from september st    st july  this ppl increase will be a big disappointment to  producers who are now firmly well off the pace  the reality is that dairy crest and the producer group dcd reached an agreement in april  for  further price drops in june and july and then having assessed the market decided to agree to a price hold until st october   dairy crest could have held firm until st october and refused any price increase but the lesson for dcd to learn is the difference between a price hold and a price floor  had dcd agreed that the july reduction would have been the last reduction then further increases would have undoubtedly have flowed because a flaw would not prevent price increases   the situation leaves dcd and dairy crest with much head scratching when it comes to negotiating the st october price at the end of august  the increase for st october will have to be significant and if it isnt agreed our understanding is that deadlock would mean that dairy crest producers could leave on  months notice and that would be a situation that mark allen and his team will not want to take a chance on    in the latest addition of dairy industry newsletter barry wilson has described dairy crest and its price movements as shameful especially given the profits in the cheese business are up  to almost łmillion for the year to march   wilson says that operating margins at this level are both the highest in the uk cheese sector and probably in dairy crests history  for august it seems that dairy crest will be at the bottom of the milk price league tables and wilson goes on to highlight that mark allens salary for  at łmillion with share options worth łmillion  wilson then closes his article with a very hard hitting statement that if he was a davidstow supplier he would be looking elsewhere if this is how he was being treated   it remains to be seen how tough dcd are in the next round of negotiations but for sure if dairy crest dont play their cards right they could be in for a bruising   arla unanimously vote to move to  months notice period   st july  at a meeting this week  of arla representatives voted for uk members to be given a  month notice period option with only  voting against the resolution   first milk price contract changes   st july  first milk have decided to abandon a and b pricing following the lead of several other milk purchasers  this decision is one of several  outcomes of a pricing review which started in march    while some farmers will understandably criticise the move on the basis that b pricing now should be very high it has to be balanced by the fact that first milks b price for july is only  ppl and off the pace  the reason for this appears to be that first milk dont have any  surplus milk with all their members milk required for their core business contracts  in fact when questioned first milk claim that they are now buying milk from third parties for short term opportunities  far more often then they are selling surplus    the coop believes that the one price offering will be welcomed by the majority of members especially now that it is accompanied by a simple ppl production bonus paid on all litres if the amount produced in one month is equal or greater to the corresponding month  months earlier  this is simply a statement by first milk that they want to encourage members to deliver more milk   another change is that the individual transporthaulage charges have been removed from st september   first milk have also stated that during the course of next week the expectation is that they will be announcing another  price rise    new board members at muller    st july  at tuesdays farmer forum meeting there were  farmers put forward for  positions on the muller farmer board   roddy catto as chairman and board member lost his position as did chris willis  grant hartman was the only one of the  candidates to retain his position and he is now joined by john hocknell and stephen foster    other places taking it to a total of  are up for election next year   at the next meeting in august the farmer forum will need to elect a chairman vice chairman and finance officer and the odds on favourite to take the position of chairman must surely be david herdman who is the current vice chairman of the group and former chairman of dcd   ppl equivalent milk price for july deliveries paid by friesland campina   th july  having announced a july farm gate price increase of  euro cents per kg wwwmilkpricescom have calculated that at current exchange rates of  euro  ppl and converted to our standard liquid litre results in a price paid of ppl  this represents an increase of ppl compared to  months ago   using the same numbers the friesland campina organic standard liquid litre price equates to a farm gate price of ppl   arla members are encouraged to discuss the proposal to move to a  months notice period    th july  arla members have been given the minimum required  working days notice to consider and express any views on the proposed resolution for the immediate removal of the  month notice to leave period to be replaced by a  month period as proposed and promoted by the ukaf board    several arla members have contacted ian during the week questioning the move with some suggesting that an immediate jump from  months to  months should have been staged with a  month interim notice period  it was the ukaf board who made the decision to go in one jump   the main bone of contention appears to be the minimum short  working day notice period which for some is leading to speculation and suspicion which clearly will be a disappointment to arla  this is especially the case given the fact that if this is voted through next thursday th july the  month notice period will take effect immediately   some farmers believe the option for a farmer to leave a milk purchaser in  months keeps that purchaser sharp and focussed on the real market place  as it stands today all of the main gb milk purchasers who do not comply with the voluntary code are on a  month notice period as are some of the code compliant purchasers  only muller dairy crest and parkham farms currently operate a  month notice period on a price change   notices for arla farmers in denmark and sweden vary from  months to  months depending on when the farmer submits his notice  note arlas plan is to standardise notice periods across all countries during the next  years   one thing is clear in the event a number of arla farmers were to leave having given only  months notice it potentially results in the remaining members having to plug any hole with the business often having to acquire expensive spot milk which ultimately reflects on the milk price paid to the remaining members   arla farmers are urged to raise any concerns and discuss the implications of the resolution with their local area representative at the earliest opportunity and ahead of thursdays vote

where he pointed to a reduction in milk production coupled with the move from spreads back to real butter following confirmation from scientists that eating butter is not responsible for clogging up

that one or more of the interviewers was told by the nfu that arla were scaremongering in relation to suggestions that butter and cream will be short   according to current wholesale market prices butter and cream are already short and very soon retailers will have to pass on increases to consumers   for the nfu to comment like this smacks of an industry where its left hand doesnt know what its right hand is doing achieved nothing and looks to be a case of negatively counteracting arlas message just for the sake of it   the division comes at a critical time when the industry needs to be

negotiations   commissioner phil hogan spoke in the evening and gave very positive signs that he wanted to work with the uk dairy industry to ensure a soft brexit  yes the cynical will likely comment that hogan will want a soft landing given his irish roots but he had the perfect opportunity to deliver a hard hitting warning to the uk dairy industry and he chose to deliver the opposite message of wanting to work together   chairman of dairy uk david dobbin was very clear that trading with the eu without tariffs and barriers must continue and that now is the time for the industry to hammer home the significance of dairy   dobbin went on to highlight that the uk food and drink industry is bigger than the car and aerospace industry combined with  uk families depending on the  billion

  however the nfu england  wales appear to have arla in their sights and turning almost a blind eye to making any meaningful comment on the practices and milk price reductions of other milk purchasers especially county milk  see last weeks bulletin with ppl retrospective producer price cut   as the biggest milk purchaser arla should expect to receive adverse press coverage when they drop the price however numerous people are questioning why the nfu havent done a press release lambasting county milks ppl backdated price cut which effectively waves two fingers to the dairy industry voluntary code of best practice and firmly takes the industry back to the dark days pre the code   so whilst the nfu claim farmers are asking whats going on reference the arla ppl cut ian can confirm others

to ppl having risen from around ppl in less than  weeks    despite all the efforts of the nfus and others to introduce a code of conduct its hardly fair to hear back dated price cuts are still

be grounds for farmers to insist these to be immediately rescinded to demonstrate fairness and transparency  the alternative is some purchasers risk being tagged as opportunist robin hoods especially

crests liquid division    whilst morrisons are unlikely to go to a segregated pool they are moving towards what some would call a nominated pool with specific farmers nominated with whom morrisons will presumably want to engage in return for which additional funds will be paid to the retailer   the loss of such a large quantity will be a blow to muller as it would be to any processor   more

so following on from ians current dairy farmer article the two awkward squad farmers are the ones with a big call and a potential problem unless they have decided their future is in not supplying

limited suppliers  from april st   producer notified     th march  this is the second consecutive ppl price drop by county according to its farmer suppliers  however according to one source county are exposed to the ingredients market via yew tree dairy which has certainly crashed back especially given the fact the smp price is now close to intervention level  the likelihood of spring milk going into intervention stores to add to the existing  tonnes of old stock is now almost inevitable for april   county were unavailable to confirm what their st april standard liquid litre price would be following the ppl reduction which we will endeavour to report next week   ppl  euro cent milk price drop bombshell from arla  st april        th march  around  arla members owners  have been notified that from april st their milk price will reduce by  euro cent equal to ppl  the reduction will not apply to arlas uk organic suppliers although arlas mainland europe organic suppliers will feel the full force of the reduction   of some comfort is the fact the currency smoothing mechanism will provide a ppl increase resulting in a net reduction of ppl  the reduction reduces the st april standard liquid litre price including the currency smoothing adjustment to ppl and for the standard manufacturing litre to ppl   its a big blow to arla members and regrettably if arla sneeze others will catch a cold  pretty much everyone in the industry had expected or prayed for a stand on price for april and may which with the filtering through of the currency smoothing would have seen farm gate milk price increases  this cut will hurt   there are strong rumours that a similar reduction is already in the pipeline for may st coupled with the belief that arla have overpaid producers for milk especially the recent th payment  if another cut happens on may st arla will struggle to deal with their farmer communications to justify a second cut   the arla cut could easily kick start a trend which others seize if it does it will be the final straw for a number of dairy farmers who havent even begun to recover from the last slump in prices   meanwhile the arla brands have been named as recording the largest growth out of the top  uk grocery brands achieving growth of łm in    arla members are already questioning whether achieving such headline grabbing brand growth is actually delivering a better milk price to the farmer owners given that in cheese some of its competitors are now paying ppl for milk which is going into branded cheese   gdt average up   th march    the most

cheese   smp intervention tenders halved as interest plummets   th march  the latest eu commission smp intervention stock tender resulted in just two bids for only  tonnes compared to bids for almost  tonnes in december   the current two tender windows each month will be reduced to one and there seems minimal prospect of any product coming out of store unless the eu commission significantly reduce their minimum price   first milk add to their trophy cabinet   th march  last night first milk won nestle uks supplier of the year award as well as a nestle quality award both collected by mike gallacher  both are viewed as further ringing endorsements that the coop and its members are on the right track with its major customer    muller suppliers to battle it out for  forum places    th march  healthy competition is the order of the day in some of the muller farmer forum regions with  candidates competing for  places  ballot packs will be sent to members next week with the elected board to be insitu next month when their task will be to represent  muller suppliers  lets hope the  selected have ability to represent their area and its not noisy ones with confidence but little ability   two dairy ceos step down within days of each other    th march         mike gallacher steps down as first milks ceo  turnaround job done    th march  mike gallacher is to step down as first milks ceo and turnaround guru in april and into his shoes will step shelagh hancock   its a near as damn it  years to the day since gallacher was parachuted into first milk and at the time the coop was on life support and at best only weeks away from the life support machine being turned off  it wasnt quite as bad as dfob but it was looking like a sick dog which needed putting out of its misery  the dairy industrys vultures were circling all eager to pick over the carcase but none wanted to be first to swoop in  it was a badly run business and the one thing the first milk board did get right was to reshape regroup and give gallacher a free hand   as gallacher leaves he hands over a very different business and whilst it will still have to operate profitably in a challenging environment its a fact today there are other uk dairy businesses in worse shape than first milk   its unusual to see dairy ceos involved in a smooth planned succession but this is one such case  normally its a sacking dressed up with lots of spin    gallachers successor shelagh hancock has  years of experience having been involved with the first milk business for almost  months  she has previously worked for glanbia been a key figure in milk link until the arla takeover and latterly medina dairies   shelagh is essentially a coop person and will steer first milk on the same course gallacher has set with little if any need for a change in direction  there is already at least one new opportunity on her desk for her to explore and plenty of stuff to keep her occupied   its almost  years to the day since gallacher took charge and he certainly can claim to have turned around the first milk business much to the relief of its members who have seen their coop go from life support to being discharged and sent home in less than  years   next week the two commence on a gb member meeting tour to inform members of the turnaround results direction of the business current milk field issues especially the tesco field connected to the haverfordwest factory farm contract developmentsideas and the opportunity to meet their new ceo        ronald kerrs to leave muller   th march  the departure of ronald kerrs as ceo of muller and the arrival of uwe sommer doesnt appear to have been on the cards for months and part of a smooth succession plan   kerrs came to muller in  initially as head of muller uk before taking the position of group ceo in   he has certainly made his mark so far as the uk dairy industry is concerned having been involved in the dairy crest liquid business takeover as well as building a new butter plant at market drayton  on may st sommer steps into one of the most important dairy roles in europe having left his role as head of international marketing at lindt chocolate   gdt auction price crashes back     th march  tuesdays gdt auction results were very sobering with an average all products drop of  to average  tonne on top of the  fall only two weeks ago so heading towards a  fall in two weeks   key prices were all in us not nz   smp                 down      to average  tonne wmp                down      to average  tonne cheddar            down      to average  tonne        traders anticipated a further weakening of prices particularly for wmp and smp but the double digit drop came as a shock  the auction prices were the lowest recorded for over  months and for many new zealand dairy farmers the price for wmp is now at or below their breakeven cop if the auction price is a good barometer   total tonnage traded was up  to  tonnes which undoubtedly contributed to the dramatic drop especially given the fact the quantity on offer at the same auction in previous years has declined   ppl february retail supplement for muller nonaligned farmers     th march    łm investment programme by medina   th march  the łm investment programme has already commenced at medinas watsons liquid dairy facility in hampshire where  farmers supply milk to a factory employing  staff plus an additional  or so new jobs to be created during the coming  months as a result of the upgrade   first milk extend its nestle supply contract    th march  first milk has confirmed it has concluded an extension of its exclusive nestle liquid milk contract   the contract has been in the custody of first milk for more than  years  and not doubt there were numerous resident cuckoos keen to kick first milk out given half a chance because they appear to be raiding other nests with feathers flying as ian writes this piece   arla confirm the th payment  ł per gb farmer member   th march  arla have confirmed that its  gb members will receive a th payment averaging ł into their bank accounts this friday   unfortunately the arla press release referred to the ł million distribution as a windfall and a cash bonus which has certainly prompted an instant response from several arla members  as one said this choice of words windfall  cash bonus suggest that this is money for nothing    the payment is actually a return on farmers investment in the coop and the straight forward facts appear to be as follows   average fully paid up arla

money invested and a benefit of being a member  thats the simplified message and lets hopes that   we sincerely hope that defra and ahdb ensure last years fiasco is not repeated last year in early april ian described the joint effort involving ahdb and defra as irresponsible and misleading when the february average farm gate milk price was published as rocketing up by ppl   this was achieved because defra allocated the entire łmillion th payment to arla members to februarys milk price rather than spreading it over the  months as arla do it was a move which was lambasted by both ian and the tfa   ppl milk price increase for arla directs  from march st     th march  this takes producers standard liquid litre price to ppl wwwmilkpricescom   ppl milk price increase for first milks

march    new cheese plant on the cards for north wales     th march  ronald akkerman aka the flying dutchman is back on the uk dairy industries radar this time to design build and operate a  million litre a year capacity state of the art cheese factory in north wales on behalf of a group of around  spring grazing farmers who intend to form a cooperative   the initial plant is expected to be up and running by spring   with plans to expand towards  million litres   the output from the plant will be focussed on domestic consumption rather than exports with all sales through bradburys  who have an unrivalled  years experience in selling cheese  further details are anticipated in the near future   muller to offer futures contracts   th march  a muller ingredients contract is to be launched to suppliers this summer to its  or so nonaligned farmers   the contract will give farmers the opportunity to lock into a margin on up to a quarter  of their milk production by fixing their milk price based on the wwmilkpricescomfc stone published pricesuk milk futures equivalent ukmfe    volumes available will be limited to the physical quantities muller can secure back to back contracts with its ingredients customers  in other words all mullers farmers contracts will be backed off with reciprocal contracts with customers   asda launches a free range milkpasture promise branded milk    th march  asda is the first of the uks big retail giants to launch a branded free range milk with the promise that the milk comes from herds which spend at least  days and nights grazing   asda has launched with an initial  litres week going into more than  asda stores priced at ł for  litres   rabdf outlines its future focus and industry event    th march  following the disappointing decision in october last year by holstein uk when it rejected working with rabdf with a view to holding one national dairy event rabdf has reviewed and regrouped and today announced its plans for the future   there will be no livestock event at the nec on september th  instead there will be a smaller annual dairy technical event at stoneleigh park in february   there is no disputing that technology is transforming our lives and changing all businesses worldwide including dairy farming  the rabdf event will focus on new technology with technology themed seminars and speakers from across the world  the event will examine the potential of new technologies and how dairy farmers might take advantage benefit and profit from the latest developments and innovations  rabdfs focus is to transfer the latest technological ideas to grass roots dairy farmers with an event in central england   in addition rabdf will continue its influencing and lobbying role utilising its links to politicians policy makers and the trade as well as focussing on encouraging youth into the industry  to this end a youth board will be formed and rabdfs work with women in dairy initiativeand its conference will continue  there is even a rumbling that the once sold out and popular rabdf farmer conference might emerge from the ashes in middle england where there is currently nothing similar available in england or wales   medina declares improved financials for year ending th april     th march  revenue łm łm  profit łm ł loss in  in addition medina will be utilising around  of its  million litre toll processing facility with muller once its additional litreage to iceland starts at the end of this month   this world isnt big enough for the both of us  theres only milk thats going to win    th march  the australian dairy industry has declared war on nondairy alternatives to milk such as soy almond coconut and rice stating they should not be called milk because they do not have anything close to the nutritional health protein or vitamin benefits of animal milks   they claim its mislabelling and that these alternatives should be labelled and branded to ensure consumers know exactly what they are putting in their shopping baskets or whats going into their almond plant liquid lattes   its time there was a crack down  come to think of it whats all the nonsense about vegetarian sausages vegetarian burgers and vegetarian rashers of bacon   studies show soy milk can destroy your thyroid     th march  soy milk is recognised as coming almost exclusively from gmo which are high in pesticides and an alarming list of properties leading to claims that you simply should stop consuming it   in a recent study its claimed soy milk causes severe health problems including colon cancer ulceration gastrointestinal inflammation etc   wanted by a mate  all must be in good condition and ready to go to work       th march      land rover defender   td pickup with or without a

the processors supply contract and its clear that muller have taken on board producer feedback from last novembers farmer meetings and revised the offering   there is no doubt one single contract for all its suppliers is the way forward and whilst the new offering will see some farmers win and some lose it is claimed the overall package is cost neutral to the business   the forecast accuracy tolerance has been increased from  to  prior to any penalty  that relaxation should be welcome news however mullers intention is for the few farmers who fall outside of the  threshold to have one to one support from mullers agriculture team to help ensure all  farmers are under the penalty threshold  surprise milk volumes are certainly not an issue confirmed to muller   the butterfat penalty has been reduced from ppl in version  of the contract to ppl for every  less than  and identical payment of ppl for every  above    the contract notice period is only  months following a price change or contract variation compared to the old dairy crest  month notice period   if a farmer wants to expand by more than  he simply needs to have prior that means prior to spending any ł early engagement with muller so both parties know when the extra milk will materialise   milk payments into the bank will be around the th of each month and this is a midway point between the current muller and exdairy crest payment dates   finally individual farmers can utilise the online modelling software to check how the contract affects their individual production   the new contract starts on may st with the target sign up date of april st   overall ian has failed to find any trip wires or traps and the likelihood is most producers will sign the new contract if they feel it is fair and they want to join muller on its ambitious uk journey and are inspired by mullers vision  if any muller farmers believe ian has overlooked any key points please email him   arla hunting for milk but arlas ceo claims rising milk supply keeps prices in check    th february  arla has written to its uk members stating it requires more milk initially from existing members  the letter has produced a very mixed response from arla members who have contacted ian today  in summary most state they have not even started on the road to recovery following almost  years of low milk prices at below cop and have minimal appetite to ramp up production in case prices ease again    its certainly a confusing message from arla with its ceo pedar tuborgh stating   milk prices are currently at a level that is sustainable for the whole business including our farmers he said   and according to one report he has also stated   a rising supply of milk on world markets is likely to rein in further gains in prices that have increased nearly  percent since a slump last year   its certainly a mixed and confusing message from arla hq and arla uk which members are trying to sieve through   thats an individual decision but from arlas point of view if they do require extra milk existing members must be offered the chance to fill the gap  failing that arla will presumably move to stage  and open the door to new recruits to see what the appetite is   arla uk sales and revenue down    th february  arlas largest market the uk has seen its  calendar year results weigh in with a  drop in revenue to łbillion billion down from the  numbers of łbillion billion   within the numbers arlas uk branded products saw sales volumes rise by an encouraging  with branded liquid milk growing by    morrisons milk for farmers accounted for  of sales within its competitors on the shelf and arlas yoghurt sales were up  more than double but from a standing start in    arla foods as a european coop saw net profit grow by a healthy  to m     nfu launches a new contract checking facility     th february  the nfu in conjunction with its panel of legal firms has launched a contract checking service for members in the hope they use the facility prior to signing a new contract   the service comes in three stages   ˇ         a free initial discussion with the nfus callfirst specialist advisers team available to all nfu farmer members ˇ         an initial report produced by an nfu legal panel solicitor considering members requirements reviewing the contract and explaining what it means ˇ         a more detailed review with advice on how to renegotiate the contract terms   the service covers areas such as milk contracts grazing licences and tenancy agreements  its an opportunity for nfu members to seek professional help and guidance prior to signing on the dotted line  its not free but the first  las subscribers who take up the offer will be given a ł voucher towards the fee   at this weeks dairy breakout session during question time ian suggested that given the fact  muller farmers are about to receive a contract to sign and that the nfu dairy board chairman had commented that it seemed to be a reasonable and fair contract and agreed that it demonstrated that muller had listened to its producers would the nfu  consider putting out a press release specific to this contract rather than having dozens or possibly s of farmers individually contacting them for an opinion  the idea is understood to be under consideration and the nfu are expected to give some help to the muller farmers with their general view of the new contract   nfu conference     th february  brexit dominated this weeks nfu conference and whilst those negotiating on behalf of uk agriculture will battle for our industry to receive the same level of support post brexit as we receive today most are bracing themselves for a haircut and a sea change in who receives help and how its delivered   the environment secretary andrea leadson was keen to point out that   there will be support for our vital food and farming industry after we leave the eu   but she didnt confirm what sort of support how much support or for how long it would last   with  farmers receiving bps payments and these payments representing  of the average farmers income its a near certainty that such payments will not continue at this level going forward in the next decade  the cap payments were worth łbillion to the uk in  and will be very challenging to defend post brexit   the loss of these payments would trigger significant consolidation at farm level as many farms become unviable and unsustainable  there were a number of reasons to view the post brexit dairy industry with enthusiasm and optimism especially for those who are low cost milk producers wanting to expand because if the bps payments are cut or even axed more land is sure to become available  some were privately licking their lips at the prospect   rabdf future announcement    th february  the rabdf have called a press briefing on monday th march to announce the future of the organisation and presumably the future

statement  to st december            th february         in its latest trading update the additional costs experienced by dc particularly the increased farm gate price it paid for milk  has led to

mullers new farmer representative structure is in train and the elections are set to be very competitive    th february  having taken on board feedback from a nationwide series of meetings last november muller has launched its new farmer representative structure ahead of confirming any changes to its single contract launch   democratic representation appears to be what all parties want and to that end these are the nuts and bolts of the structure   a muller farmer forum of  supplying farmers will be elected by its  or so farmer members which will be roughly  per  farmers  this is split in proportion to the aligned v nonaligned farmers as follows    nonaligned farmer forum representatives  aligned farmer forum representatives  organic farmer forum representative    the positions will be for a year period by rotation  the forum will have complete responsibility for deciding the future representative structure with nothing ruled out and they could even consider setting up a dpo  basically the  farmer members start with a clean sheet of paper   on the subject of annual subscription to fund development training and independent advice it will be up to the newly elected  forum representatives to decide on what level this should be set at if any although its clear if independent advice is required it needs to be funded  muller has confirmed that initial start up funding will be provided by muller until additional funds flow into the forums bank account   once in place this forum will elect a board of  mmg board representatives to work closely with the muller management   for obvious reasons of continuity an interim board of  will be put in place and it will take  years before the forum can say all board members were put in place by the forum  however  of the existing mmg board members will immediately by rotation stand down in june of this year followed by  in  and  in    the eventual outcome should be much better communication from grass roots farmers to senior management   its time for muller farmers to put up or shut up and those interested in standing need to throw their names in to the hat by march rd for a nomination form to be returned by th march and by early april the forum members should be in place  whilst muller is tight lipped over the number of nominations they have already received they have confirmed that there will be elections in several regions which is a healthy prospect and bodes well for the future   code of conduct with advance notice of interest rate changes needed for bankers spelt with a b    th february        the uk dairy industry has committed a lot of effort and energy into ensuring all milk purchasers abide by a voluntary code and give advance notice of price movements and move away from discretionary milk pricing   the same does not appear to apply to our bankers following the recent decision by investec bank to retrospectively cut its deposit interest rates  in fact in their terms and conditions it states interest rates may at our discretion change   and we all thought the banking world has cleaned its act up   ppl milk increase for arla directs  from st february    rd

everyone admires a strong seller especially when its someone like the european commission  however their recent third tender involving  tonnes once again resulted in no sales of intervention smp and it looks as if they could have completely misread the market   during three tenders the commission have only succeeded in selling  tonnes out of a total public stock of more than  tonnes   ian has been informed that there is a shelf life for the smp and that significant quantities will have to be sold shortly and if that combines with a levelling off in smp prices or even a dip the commission could quickly turn from being a strong seller to an emergency seller which will result in most exfarm gate milk prices catching a chill including those in the uk   not to mention that its not impossible that there could be calls for further intervention this spring if the market suddenly dives   dairy markets have passed  oclock with spot prices down to  to ppl     th january  following a period of rapid upward movement in dairy trading prices spot milk prices and futures contract prices its clear commodity prices are at best levelling off and potentially about to head south  spot milk

currency and the fact cream is struggling to find homes   freshways have confirmed a rumour that one or more of its producers under notice to leave them on february st has at the th hour contacted freshways in a bid to rescind his their notice within days of ceasing to supply the firm   it will be very interesting to follow whether farm gate milk prices continue to increase in coming months  several milk purchasers gave reasons why there was a lag in prices moving up so will the same lag apply to prices levelling off or coming down  a levelling off and period of stability for all involved will be no bad thing at this stage especially if that stability comes with a farm gate milk price around  to ppl  the biggest fear is that we get an early spring with oceans of milk which will exert serious pressure on farm gate milk prices  where this market will end up is anyones guess but on todays evidence its easily passed  oclock and looking like it could be about to head south  you

board meetings  he was instrumental in dairy crests adoption of a dpo and the dairy crest formula contract both of which have been axed by muller   meadow results are impressive   th january  meadow foods limited have published their annual report and financial statements for the year ended st mach  and the financials are impressive in a year when the majority of meadows  supplying farmers and most nonaligned producers were unable to cover cost of production having to eat into any available cash reserves   given the worldwide collapse in dairy product values there is no surprise in the fact that meadows turnover was down  from łmillion to łmillion however profit before tax was only down  from łmillion to łmillion ł per meadow supplier   however meadows profit margin increased from  to  which is some achievement to maintain your margin in a collapsing market   the dividend payout to shareholders of łmillion means md simon chantler for the second consecutive year or more appears to be the best paid person in the uk dairy industry with a total payout for the year of łmillion slightly down on the previous years packet by ł  no one could confuse him with the nursery rhyme character simple simon   these results no doubt encouraged paine  partners to make their significant investment in meadow in september    details will come out in future published accounts however based on these numbers one knowledgeable bean counter is speculating the total value of the meadow business at the time of the paine  partners deal could have been in the region of łmillion     simple cost

profits before tax were up to ł million compared to a loss of łm in  bank debt had fallen to ł million vs łm in the prior year   once appointed gallacher immediately got his surgical instruments out and sold first milks loss making side lines and subsidiaries including glenfield dairy cnp professional and its stake in westbury dairies to focus on making quality cheese  thats what first milks future depends on because the big hit items have been dealt with and its down to the day to day work in which any cheesemaker with a batch of down graded cheese costs serious money  having said that in times of shortages like today rejects in the cheese world will be scarcer  according to first milk and others the quality of cheese first milk are producing is consistently high and long may this

meetings and have received some thought provoking feedback on its proposed new milk contract and farmer representation particularly from its non aligned farmers   the turnout has been around  of the  farmers supplying the company and some of the views have been described by muller as strong and for sure muller are now more in touch with the views of their suppliers  consequently they have taken note and have decided to delay introducing the new contract until into the new year with the expectation that farmers will sign from february onwards some non aligned clearly wanted muller to pull back but at least a pause and reflect means changes might be factored into the final version   there are still numerous important questions to be answered and addressed both with the proposed new contract detail and the new representation structure which will hopefully become clearer during this month   undoubtedly one of the issues muller has faced has been the timing of the two changes given the fact the non aligned muller farmers are rather frustrated and aggrieved at the slow pace of upward movement in their milk price which for december is a standard litre price of under ppl ppl

price contract assuming they dont rescind their notice  clearly during  and at the earliest opportunity freshways intends to abandon a farm gate milk price set by a basket of competitors some of whom today are dragging their feet big time   this approach is nothing new and was taken by first milk in  when then chairman bill mustoe stated we should recognise the value of committed volume and therefore future price increases will only apply to members who are not under resignation   at that time there was lots of talk about discrimination unfair trading practices and it being unreasonable but according to ians notes nothing came of it and to be fair mustoe had a point reference loyalty and commitment   the fact those who rescind their notice will be offered the extra money is

 ireland business in  and in  those losses have increased to łmillion   note the additional losses cannot be attributable to the acquisition of dairy crests liquid business which didnt complete until only  days from the year end on th december    many are now pointing the finger to the suspicion that theo muller understandably wants a return on his investment and has sharpened his teeth   there will be limited scope for mullers much loved retailer aligned contracts to reverse the losses given they are effectively toll processors for the supermarkets   so that leaves the poor nonaligned farmers fearing they will be the weakest link and the ugly sister who will face further downward pressure including significant contract changes currently on the table   some farmers are

large number of gb farmers currently facing new contracts andor significant variations in their contractual terms as well as those on low milk prices should try to find time to read the report or at least the opening  page executive summary   it looks at the realities of the new post milk quota world which is labelled as a more marketorientated cap  it goes on to flag up and confirm the well known fact there is a concern that farmers  are becoming the main shock absorber in the supply chains as regards market risks such as price volatility or prolonged periods of low prices   a number of nonaligned liquid producers would say they are the last domino in the pack and first to fall over   the report also highlights what it calls the fear factor farmers face if they wish to complain about a milk purchaser and the suggestion that victims of unfair trading practices dairy farmers should be able to lodge anonymous complaints  if that happens ian wont receive all the juicy

week from muller nonaligned farmers who were very keen to report back from  of the first  regional producer meetings  rarely if ever has ian received so much feedback in fact given the fact there are several more meetings during the next  days ian has decided to wait to see what comes in next week and will discuss the comments and mullers proposals in the next bulletin so please continue to send in your comments   the meetings have certainly welded opinion in the muller nonaligned producers and several have subsequently hit the keyboard literally several will now have big holes where the letters mule and r once were   the muller staff and board members present at the meetings have certainly been given some very direct messages the general view from the emails received is that the nonaligned see the contract changes as being nothing more than a price cut heaping further pain and unfairness upon them    ian will also comment on the proposed new producer representation structure and whether it is a step forward particularly with reference to the nonaligned producers representation within the group of  and whether they will be represented which the board of this group will select   the grocer magazine online has summed up the situation with a very forthright article written by kevin white with the headline muller facing frothing in its nonaligned milk pool the article points towards muller pushing more of its own risk on to its  nonaligned farmers with the new contract with muller purchasing  of britains milk this is a big issue and there will be many column

attributable to fonterras confirmation that milk volumes have plummeted during october  and november   notable movers cheddar             to average  tonne smp                  to average  tonne wmp                 to average  tonne   ian potter grahams dairies and the a  b deduction scheme   th november  during the past two of weeks i have commented on the a  b contracts in particular in relation to processors who make milk price deductions to producers who for various reasons fail to deliver their full a litre allocation in a particular month  with the decision by freshways to abandon a litre deductions the focus moved north of the border to grahams dairies in scotland in late october i was quoted in the scottish farmer saying that grahams suppliers were given no notice of the a litre deductions grahams has asked me to clarify that it did give notice that there could be a litre deductions when they introduced the scheme in  and the fact that a deductions were on the cards was also mentioned in a letter to producers dated th august  i accept this point and have offered my apologies to the company for inferring otherwise   my comment regarding the lack of notice centred on the information that grahams suppliers were not notified that a litre deductions were on the cards for october deliveries until a letter was posted in mid october however i have now been told that there will be no october deductions this is excellent news for grahams suppliers and a very positive step forward   i also stated that the grahams b price was cut to ppl which was what grahams told me it would be in july  however having made enquiries i am now informed that the lowest price paid was actually ppl   as part of grahams robust defence of the business in the face of negative publicity i was provided with milk pricing figures from the company the figures stated that the net average paid out to its farmers including a and b prices from october  to september  was ppl compared to its main scottish competitors arla muller and first milk who according to the numbers i was given ranged between ppl and ppl i duly had these other figures checked by independent dairy analyst chris walkland who has confirmed that the grahams figure is accurate and the arla and muller figures while not an exact match to his are close enough he did not analyse the first milk figure   thus grahams have overall paid what appears to be the highest  month average nett payout to dairy farmers in scotland   even with the b scheme grahams claim that the a  b scheme has succeeded in protecting their farmers milk price does therefore have merit   however i believe that despite this the a  b scheme has not been well communicated by any of the companies who adopted it including grahams and that the scheme has too many negatives attached to it this is especially the case when compared to the simplicity of other companies who pay a single price for all of the litres even if their headline price is not be as high as the a price would be the effectiveness of the a  b deduction scheme can also easily be disproportionate across different farmers with major unintended negative consequences on their businesses again not helping the image of the scheme   a  b contracts were believed to be groundbreaking when they were first conceived in  but back then no one envisaged the current scenario whereby a litre deductions of  to ppl or more could be applied a lot of time and effort went into the development of the new contracts but i believe that it is time to evaluate the pros and cons and either refine them significantly or revert to alternative mechanisms the risk of bad press and farmer discontent on an a or b price deduction outweighs the value grahams have today confirmed to ian that they are reviewing their a and b contracts on a one to one basis with producers to canvass their thoughts which is a positive time consuming move by the company which will give farmers the opportunity to have their say   the bottom line is grahams like all other milk purchasers have to balance supplies against sales and in the space of  months the spot price has varied from p to p making balancing extremely challenging for grahams the variation for them in that period has been from   million litres of milk above the a volumes aka b milk to now where production is   million litres plus below a volumes   it is a priority for the industry that a longterm solution to these swings must be found but it is my view that the a  b system requires further reform if it is to have a role in that going forward   dairy farmers in northern ireland vent their anger  th november  an estimated  or so dairy farmers in northern ireland have had enough and have agreed to strike  part of their frustration is the lack of upward movement on farm gate milk prices in addition to anger at the stances taken by dairy uk in connection with its decision to cease engagement with the ulster farmers union   the group stated after the news this week that dairy uk ni have blocked future engagement with the uister farmers union over their criticism of the failure of coops to pass on better milk market returns to farmers the contempt and arrogance that milk coops now have for their producer members is totally unacceptable and should result in coop

all a litre under supply penalties will be cancelled and they have backdated this to st october which has been extremely well received by its  or so farmer suppliers and its customers note this is not a temporary amendment to the contract but a permanent change   freshways have recognised that when the a  b contract was introduced a situation whereby some farmers could suffer huge financial penalties was never planned or envisaged the move to scrap it has sent a clear message to freshways suppliers that the firm is listening to farmers and keen to retain their supply by supporting them good on freshways   according to our records this leaves grahams dairies of scotland as the only uk milkpricescom listed milk purchaser who from october st is penalisingdeducting significant amounts of money from any of its farmers who fail to fulfil their a litres by what is currently an eye watering several pence per litre figure there is a real possibility that there will be more on this story as the issue is sure to run and run with a lot of questions being asked by grahams suppliers competitors who wish to seize on the controversy and potentially try to mopup any disaffected suppliers and

producers claim the goalposts have been moved   th october  grahams dairies scotland were last featured in this newsletter when they dramatically dropped their b milk price to only ppl and in doing so sending a very clear message to its suppliers that it simply did not want any b litres  farmers instantly responded by culling cows cutting feed and cutting milk production  in the past week some have claimed that they also signed up to the eu milk reduction scheme which started on st october  and now another shock has come because grahams producers have received a bombshell letter  after the st october   informing them that from october st any producer who failed to fill their a litres would be financially penalised   for some it appears to be the final straw who are still getting a litres at p which is below their cost of production  some were furious and arranged a get together to meet fellow suppliers and to send a clear message to the graham family as to how they feel about the treatment they are receiving   freshways are struggling with angry loyal producers    th october  according to numerous emails ian has received freshways also have significant numbers of dissatisfied suppliers many of whom claim to have already handed in their notice  in summary most if not all claim they are not being treated fairly and are being held to ransom by a combination of their milk buyer and their contract   most claim they are selling a litres at below cop however freshways will not allow them to cut their losses and exit the industry with dignity instead insisting they must give a minimum of nine months notice   so irrespective of whether its ill health poor profitability old age or simply that the farmers have had enough of what they call exploitation its producers cannot stop milking  no longer apparently can the freshways farmer decide when he can sell his cows and even a tb breakdown is not a valid reason to exit dairy farming and yet freshways can serve notice when they like as happened a few months ago   in addition along with grahams dairies see above freshways are one of only two dairies we know who penalise farmers for failing to fulfil their a litres    one claimed that when his a price penalty was added to his a milk price he is still receiving ppl for october deliveries   its clear that freshways are approaching a crisis and that they will not retain their current  suppliers and could find it very challenging to attract new replacement producers    nonaligned aggrieved producers  what can they do    th october  the discontent among nonaligned farmers is growing significantly but what can they do about their position in simple terms they can bite the bullet and resign and thats possibly the only language some processors will understand  they shouldnt pay lip service to their neighbour threatening to resign if things dont improve they should resign themselves and resign now   if you feel you are being exploited andor treated unfairly by your milk buyer take charge of your own destiny and do something about it  please dont let your milk purchaser demoralise you and your family any more  dont let them cripple your business further and under no circumstances let them promise you jam tomorrow   if the trust has gone and the relationship broken down change buyers or get out  even if it means you have to sell your milk for a slightly lower price for the time being to a milk purchaser who you trust and thinks is fair   its jaw dropping that individual hard working honest dairy farmers who are considered the backbone of the countryside cannot chose whether they exit the industry  even some of those who opted for the eu milk reduction programme now find that the money is simply going to their milk purchaser in the form of a litre penalties which is surely not as the eu commission planned and from a moral and ethical point of view has to be questioned   we are in yet another crisis and as i have said before dont fall for promises of jam tomorrow or little tweaks to your contract because its gone beyond that with some buyers   its demoralising and its exploitation if some milk purchasers are now concerned over their future milk supply then i have no sympathy  they have made their bed and need to be made to lie in it   one farmer has even informed me that his milk purchaser suggested that his single farm payment would soon be in the bank suggesting that that would be his saviour  little did he realise that all of that money is already spoken for   its time the government got stuck into the tactics of some gb milk buyers and looked in to their contracts in detail  whether its a job for the groceries code adjudicator or for someone else is one for the future but some producers need urgent help to ensure fair play and that requires a referee in one form or another   australias milk production continues to plummet   th october  australias milk production

 a group of enterprising and active muller nonaligned farmers have kick started a campaign based on the fact sooty and his three friends on the mmg board all on aligned contracts are failing to

email mullernonalignedgmailcom   as one industry leader commented to ian this is a smart move by muller nonaligned who are taking their own initiative due to the complete absence of consultation andor leadership from sooty  friends   minimal cooperation from holstein uk   th october  negotiations to merge the rabdfs livestock event and uk dairy day into one national dairy event identical to the one rabdf ditched have sadly ended in no resolution after  months of discussions   the fact two of our dairy organisations have failed to agree on a way forward to hold one national event is damming  as one industry leader emailed to ian what hope is there for the uk dairy sector when even out own internal organisations are unable to cooperate   from the evidence presented to ian holstein uks board slammed the door shut in rabdfs face last tuesday  statements made by holstein uk as to the reasons they have terminated discussions are rather limp and at best good excuses   for example its a bit rich for holstein uks ceo richard jones to detail one of the main reasons for holstein uk pulling out being concerns about rabdfs financial position given holstein uks former ceo was found guilty of pocketing ł of its funds and sentenced to  years in prison   the rabdfs planned september event is likely to need life support but it will be exhibitors who have the final say as to which event if either succeeds  will they support the rabdf at the nec or will they support the aggressive upstarts in holstein uk  it seems inevitable we will only have one september dairy show and to that end holstein uk may be successful but its a very sad state of affairs the two organisations couldnt agree   nick everington exits as rabdf ceo with no retirement party   th october  there was no surprise at the announcement that nick everington had left his position as ceo of rabdf after  years however the notice to members was jaw dropping and contained more spin than a childs spinning top   according to rabdf mr everington has retired but the announcement allegedly came some time after he had left his desk for the last time  few if any will believe this is retirement and most will be convinced that his determination to move the very successful dairy event to a july livestock event date which spectacularly bombed is the main reason for his sudden retirement    had rabdf stuck with a national dairy event in september there is little doubt former events coordinator richard evans would not have gone to holstein uk to set up a rival dairy day   one area nick everington can claim to eclipse holstein uk on is the matter of show fixing  everington was shoulder to shoulder with the great yorkshire show on the matter whereas holstein uk appear to bow to pressures from breeders with serious financial interests in showing and insisting on the ability to fix and cheat at shows both home and abroad   the image of the uk dairy industry will be seriously damaged one day if holstein uk continue to turn a blind eye to fixing and fail to police their own show rules   ridiculously cheap milk   th october  spa shop on cowpen road blyth has  litres of

for producers to apply for the first window which closes on wednesday next st september at am and will be for a  month reduction period st october to st december  with other windows to follow until the money is fully subscribed  according to dairy market weekly any farmer who applies for the first reduction period may also apply for the fourth period assuming there is still money in the pot   with many producers facing an october milk price of under ppl if they do qualify it looks like a case of less  more  less milk  less work  less invoices  less pain and more money   the total ł million

ppl and rising but arla say no to ppl winter premium  th september  there are really only two forces in the current extremely hot gb spot milk market  the two buyers who are hoovering up virtually all available spot milk are muller and arla   both deny they have any short or medium term supply problems yet both are buying up spot milk like it was the last in the world   to farmers supplying either of them at ppl to ppl this will be a big disappointment to learn that both processors find it economical to fill any shortfall with spot milk as opposed to paying a higher winter milk price to encourage existing suppliers to churn out more milk   spot milk is currently around ppl and tipped to hit ppl by the end of september   so far as arla members are concerned it is now confirmed that its farmer bor put forward a proposal in july for the coop to pay a ppl winter supplement on the additional litres a farmer delivered over and above the litres delivered in the corresponding month last year   this was done in the full knowledge arla were on course for a winter milk supply shortage  guess what  the idea was thrown out by the arla board on the basis one countrys producers could not be seen to receive such an incentive and that it was better to deal with supply problems via high prices in the spot market   as several arla members are calling for national pricing convinced the one size fits all with a single arla farm gate milk price is unsustainable   yew tree dairy aka woodcocks launch their farmers milk futures trading  th september  ian has been involved in discussions concerning the benefits of dairy futures contracts since  and its taken until this week for a farmer futures trading contract to be made available   out of a crisis usually comes some good and solutions and there can be no doubt that the woodcock families dairy farming experience  the fact they have milked cows and their close relationship with many farmers who have turned to woodcocks to save their dairy farming business has spurred them to look for alternatives  remember when many farmers were dumped by their existing milk purchaser and had nowhere to go woodcocks pledge was to offer a home for their milk   thats part of the woodcock family offer  they have alternative outlets for milk from retail to commodity and ingredient outlets and now its supplying farmers have the option to lock into a margin and trade a percentage of their milk on futures the bulk of the work to get to this stage has come from a team  effort involving stephen bradley of wwwmilkpricescom   fc stone and  carl woodcock   this week farmer suppliers listened to presentations from both stephen and carl and the opportunity for farmers to trade and lock into a margin  is expected to commence in early october the meetings were well attended particularly the one in ayr which was standing room only and stephen bradley commented that it brought back memories of the huge interest generated when the dcd  formula contracts were launched some farmers may be large enough to take out single contracts however it is expected that the majority of yew tree suppliers will see woodcocks group farmers together into squadrons in order to fill futures contracts  all contracts will be backed off at farm level in order to protect a farm margin it is recommended a futures feed contract is taken out   farmers decide what percentage of their milk they forward sell and its clear that doing nothing and making your dairy business suffer the pain of recent months is a huge gamble but trading futures and locking into a margin is a safety belt for some this way of doing business could potentially be a life line   now its a case of ensuring the yew tree farmers who are keen to trade are futures ready and thats in hand  we believe it will work and the likelihood is that other processors will be forced to offer similar schemes to help insulate their farmers from some of the price volatility extremes   its a big project but the woodcock family are never phased by the size of the project and only focus on the outcomes  all eyes will be watching how their famers get on as we move into  with what is a new exciting and different way to lock into a margin for future monthsyears   in the us dairy farmers have to use these risk management tools to justify expansion and investment and to demonstrate they are globally competitive     vote for the female who takes control of farmers for breakfast th september  when i was livestock auctioneer i worked with a young girl called meg

have purchased the  shareholding owned by the pickering family plus part of the chantler familys  shareholding  the deal has taken around  months to conclude following an initial approach to simon chantler from paines   for the staff management and executives at meadow foods its business as usual with all staff retained under the same managerial control  for the meadow foods farmer suppliers its also business as usual    for the business it will be a major game changer because meadow foods are now catapulted into the big boys playground when it comes to acquisitions and expansion given the capital backing and fire power paine  partners bring to the table    it will be interesting to see where the new business makes its first big move but for sure meadow foods and paine  partners are going to figure in the uk and european dairy news frequently from now on as the business grows and possibly at a rate few had previously contemplated   the challenge for paine  partners meadow staff and executives will be to try to maintain the personal one to one family relationship meadow have cultivated with their  producers whilst embarking on its ambitious expansion plans  in addition to continue to pay a leading exfarm gate milk price to retain existing loyal suppliers and attract new recruits and not give the impression that the new private equity investors want more than a fair return on their capital at the expense of farmer suppliers   paine  partners website wwwpainepartnerscom is agriculturally impressive and claims current assets of  billion ł billion having been set up

immediate price increases and frequently they are quickly kicked back with words like but arla and muller havent increased farm gate prices yet  well come next wednesday arla are expected to take the lead on muller with a member price increase for september following which muller will have to follow                 milk supply is dropping worldwide and has tipped the supply and demand balance upside down in a matter of months and processors need to realise it will only continue to fall irrespective of any delayed upward movement in exfarm gate milk prices  some have overcooked it and robbed producers blind   is this all fair or is there evidence of tactical moves  th august  some processors are claiming they work on basket prices which include the likes of muller and arla and until they move their farm gate milk prices up they cant move theirs up  its what is called hanging on the shirt tail  muller know that their refusal to lift prices in september catches out a number of their smaller competitors because their farmers are screaming for more money and customers are resisting until the likes of muller move on price   on top of that some liquid processors are guilty of packing milk for customers at ridiculously low prices  they were desperate to retain volume so they dropped their trousers and pants to keep existing customers and to smash and grab new ones at unsustainably low prices   the problem here is they did it using a milk into powder price of p so the odd penny more and they thought they were slightly better off   but those cheap contracts are still running and they could cripple the processor alternatively the processor cripples their farmer suppliers with low or nonexistent milk price increases  either way the farmer pays for the fact some processors have completely misread the market and are now under serious pain just as their farmers are  the worry is whether all processors can weather the storm and still retain their milk field  notices to leave some buyers milk should now be flooding in because they understand that language  sadly it will be a miracle if all survive and some farmers need to remember processors who

  ppl milk price increase for suppliers to pattesmores  from st august producer notified    th august    muller defends their corner  attempt to dig themselves out of a pr grave  th august  ceo of muller uk ronald kers has responded to mounting criticism on his firms refusal to move non aligned farm gate milk prices up with a letter to his producers  it states the case for the defence and in bold letters once again claims he is building britains biggest and best dairy business    the letter is clear that muller prices will not go up until we actually realise these higher returns within our business  clearly muller havent achieved that for august or september which is a worry and some believe this is because muller have forward sold quantities of milk which now look vey cheap and could be holding prices back   where the letter is silent is with reference to the question asked by michael oakes nfu dairy board chairman last week which was for muller to explain why farmers have received some of the extra cream money see above    however analyst and journalist chris walkland has commented he does not blame muller for not moving the price up in september  he points the finger to the incredible lack of lobbying of milk buyers like muller sooner which if it had happened might have persuaded muller to move its non aligned price for september st  the evidence points to a very limited number of complaints about the muller no aligned milk price from its own farmers   to be fair the letter does make some valid points several of which were mentioned in this bulletin last week in addition there are a couple of irritating ones  no matter what the defence is the reality is that heading into winter on a farm gate milk price of  to ppl is painful unstainable disappointing and will not promote additional production   finally the letter should ideally have gone out at the end of july with the announcement that milk prices for muller non aligned were frozen  at the same time it could have addressed where the extra cream returns money muller has received has gone   arla farmer milk brand broke the  million litre barrier in two weeks   th august  arlas farmers milk sales

from ppl   muller under attack for announcing no price increase before october st   th august  this weeks dairy news and chatter has been dominated by mullers announcement its non aligned suppliers will not see any increase until at least october st  there was talk of a possible mid september rise however muller have subsequently ruled this out   the announcement attracted widespread criticism particularly from nfu dairy board chairman michael oakes who certainly sharpened his teeth and let go with both barrels in a press release   his language was unusually strong for an nfu press release but his frustration was understandable   in the nfus release michael oakes refers to mullers ppl retailer premium with a hint that muller could be using this as a reason not to increase producer prices in september  he commented   müllers nonaligned suppliers will no doubt be dumbfounded by müllers decision to hold the decision is an insult to its suppliers and is completely out of line with recent positive market movements which are bringing some confidence to the industry at last   im sincerely hoping that müller isnt hiding behind the retail supplements paid by lidl aldi and morrisons rather than reacting to the market realities we are seeing in cream incomes wholesale prices and volume reductions cream incomes to a liquid retailer have increased by a whopping  since müller last increased its base price and current daily deliveries of milk are down  on this time last year this stand on milk price also makes a mockery of the support retailers gave and continue to give dairy farmers in minimum farm gate pricing   similar comments came from graeme kilpatrick chairman of nfus with   i can think of no justifiable reason why muller has chosen to ignore the market and leave their nonaligned suppliers languishing with an unsustainable milk price  i sincerely hope that muller isnt hiding behind this retailer supplement and using it as an excuse for not lifting prices now   farmers for action are equally ignited and protests are on the radar see below   the muller milk group chairman and former board have come under attack with the group collectively described as impotent as well as muller messengers rather than negotiators  in addition the fact it doesnt affect most of the muller farmer board because they are on retailer aligned contracts has not gone unnoticed   did this group prepare their case for an increase if so why did they agree to the stand on or were they simply told thats the position they claim to represent  plus farmers and will know that muller have pocketed money on the cream price alone   muller have certainly received additional income particularly from cream and questions are being asked whether they have retained it or given part or all of it away to retail customers rather than passing it back to farmers   to be  balanced it has to be remembered that like arla muller have paid one price for every litre and not introduced a and b pricing with which comes the opportunity to create chaos in the liquid market  by playing smash and grab with competitors customers using b milk bought for as little as    or ppl muller have had to defend those predatory prices and retain customers  in reality they cut prices slower and by smaller amounts than they could have and thats perhaps one explanation as to why upward price movements arent coming as quickly as some producers desperately need it to   the move leaves muller nonaligned farmers on only a ppl standard litre price and the exdairy crest producers on only ppl  note when muller do decide to move up on milk prices they will equalise both the muller milk group ppl and direct milk exdc ppl milk prices which is undoubtedly a factor in their equations and decision to hold producer prices   the nfus release concluded with müller is throwing its support to the british team at this years olympics and its about time it showed similar support to its nonaligned farmers who deserve improved milk prices all eyes now point towards arla and whether their member milk price increases for september st  if it does increase by a useful amount it wont help muller in its bid to be both the biggest and best gb milk processor  if arla dont move the nfu will have to sharpen their teeth for the second time in a month   farmers for

milk prices particularly those who are paying market related or ab prices  this has to be welcome news however we are concerned that some milk purchasers are introducing penalties for under supply and are encouraging increased milk production direct from farms  the uk is not short of milk and milk buyers should be careful and diligent in encouraging producers to increase supply if we are to see a sustained recovery   the final sentence should be studied by all dairy farmers   no change for arla members milk price for august at ppl  th july  one must surely come for september   spot milk  ppl  if you can find it   th july  the ppl spot milk barrier has been broken but it is very scarce in march some milk buyers told suppliers they wanted less milk and had no home for all the milk they were receiving consequently farmers responded and cut production in some instances turning cows into meat   however whilst spot milk price headlines are sensational the total amount of spot milk traded in gb accounts to a maximum of  of total production  it is however an important barometer of daily supply  demand    according to wwwmilkpricescom if farmers deduct ppl from the headline spot price it will give them an approximate farm gate equivalent milk price    milk prices are moving up but no news from the big guns yet  th july  price increases are coming through but there is still no positive news from either of the two gb liquid big guns namely arla and muller other than the fact both have declared that their member milk price will not increase before st september   gb milk production is now down almost  m litres a day compared to the same weeks in  and gb in  has seen the biggest fall in production compared to the other  eu member states in holland the corresponding  months of  has

the likes of the nfus should be doing some analysis to see who went down quickest and who is hanging back and slow to increase   is the freshways a  b system working as it should  th july  freshways have written to its farmer suppliers and confirmed to ian that farmers who produce below their agreed weekly litres are likely to be penalised  freshways do regularly trade in the spot market and will now be facing a ppl price for any top up milk they require they do however anticipate that their july b milk price is likely to be heading towards ppl which if paid leaves a huge gap between themselves and the likes of meadow foods whose estimated b price for july is only ppl   if freshways do pay a b price in the region of ppl they will be able to claim that their operation of a  b pricing is exactly how it was designed   note in reality some milk buyers could say they will pay ppl or ppl for b milk in the full knowledge that their producers are unable or unwilling to produce any b litres in that particular month   unless some processors start to operate the a  b pricing mechanism as it was designed its image is likely to be tarnished for life   m dairy aid package has

  of the m a total of m will be allocated in the form of a national envelope handled by each member state with the uk down to receive łm m the commission say that member states can match fund this taking the total compensation for the uk to łm  but if anyone believes our treasury will put łm into dairy farming they are likely to still believe in the tooth fairy   the remaining m will be paid as an incentive to producers for cutting milk production based on milk they do not produce in a  month period compared to the same  months period production in   exact details are still to be confirmed however the rate is expected to be around ppl for each litre not produced and rather surprisingly the payment will be available to retired farmers as well as on farm processors  this extra money takes the total paid by the commission to over  billion during the crisis   holstein uk statement on dairy day for the decoded version see below   th july  following the disastrous livestock

down  on the weekly statistics equivalent to a  million litres a day drop on the amount produced last year   arla brand to pay more money to farmers  th july  following the extremely successful launch  months ago by morrisons of its milk for farmers brand comes the arla farmers milk brand which has been initially rolled out in  asda stores this week in those asda stores consumers have the choice between standard asda discounted milk at p for  pints or to pay an extra p for the new brand note the morrisons success is such that volumes sold are almost  times the amount budgeted   as well as coming on the back of the morrisons success its launch will have been spurred on following arlas recent research which confirmed that  of consumers care about dairy farmers and are willing to pay more for dairy products if they know the extra money actually goes back to dairy framers   so all eyes are waiting for the tweets and interviews from the small vocal family of grim reapers who quickly came out when the morrisons brand was launched all of whom either supplied another retailer or were a tiny processor with an arla axe to grind from arlas point of view these people were described as

been allowed to continue too long and needs arresting given the numbers and facts we doubt even the first milk magician mike gallacher could pull a rabbit out of the hat if he were to be parachuted in not withstanding the fact he has plenty to keep him occupied at first milk   for  rabdf budgeted to make a loss of ł but the actual deficit was ł and this loss came on top of a  loss of ł houston we have a problem and we are almost stranded   ppl milk price increase for suppliers to the fresh milk company aka lactalis th july  this is another two stage price increase of ppl from august st and ppl from september st   previously fmc had declared a  month price holding guarantee which like others it has decided to bin by announcing a price increase which comes in addition to the previous ppl july

prices are only an indication of supply and demand on a daily basis and come with a wealth warning   however wwwmilkpricescom have recorded daily spot prices during june and the average months spot price they calculate as ppl having started in early june at ppl and ended at ppl   during the first week of july spot prices have traded at ppl and possibly more   livestock event  was like a sick dog on life support needing to be put out of its misery th july  ian only attended the first day of the event which was poorly attended and the dairy exhibitors he spoke to were extremely disappointed at the number of farmers attending and the enquiries apart from the farmers the number of company absentees was staggering take the feed sector alone no for farmers no carrs billington no nwf no devenish no mole valley and why because having a show in july is just a crap month   there is no way rabdf can run a successful oneday event in  in direct competition to uk dairy day the exhibitors ian spoke to all claimed that if there was no agreement on merging the event they would only either attend the uk dairy day in  or alternatively would boycott both events there is talk of the two events amalgamating but the truth is if rabdf had consulted and listened to exhibitors and not moved to july in the first place we wouldnt have two events the disastrous date change and loss of direction by moving the name away from dairy to livestock left the door wide open to uk dairy day and holstein exploited it very well indeed   but as personalities battle for positions its quickly heading for a knockout in which holstein uk are favourites to win but it shouldnt come to that if the uk can negotiate an exit from europe then two dairy organisations should be able to negotiate over trade shows they will both be laughing stocks if they cant its a miracle heads havent already rolled over the rapid demise of the rabdfs flagship cash cow event the profits of which are used to fund the whole organisation one dairy farmer emailed ian to simply state the livestock event was rubbish another described this years twoday event as resembling a sick dog that needed taking to the vets and putting out of its misery michael king rabdf chairman peter alvis vice lord curry president and others within the rabdfs council are desperately trying to shake things up and turn the ship around but its now much tougher than it was earlier this week   sean marmite rickard to chair first milks member council th july  sean rickard is well known to farmers and is best described like ian as marmite some love him whilst others hate him however both groups tend to listen to what he has to say and talk about it   sean is to immediately take the chairmanship of first milks member council who will oversee the coops strategy and represent its farmer membersowners   sean is sure to ruffle some feathers with his rather blunt straight talking style  which occasionally gets very serious when he wags and points his finger at you saying let me tell you my friend  he wont be every farmers cup of tea but he will call it how it is no matter how

tonnes at a fixed price of  tonne approximately ł tonne  this ceiling is unlikely to be reached this year given the current direction of travel of markets   total tonnage in store has reached almost  tonnes of which  are at the fixed price and  tonnes via tender   in the space of weeks smp intervention storage has gone from  tonnes to  tonnes and the  tonnes of product in store will have to come out and be sold which will hamper any recovery  its a huge tonnage and a big black cloud   now dairy prices really have turned the corner   st july  ahdb dairy this week has a headline titled wholesale prices move off the floor  this surely officially confirms what others have been stating for the past  to  months that prices have bottomed and are on the up    cows in the worlds biggest robotic milking farm   st july  a farm in chile will install  robots and become the biggest robotic milking farm in the world   rabdf does a uturn abandoning its livestock event in    st july  in  the rabdf broadened the scope of the two day dairy event and once again renamed it to be the livestock event   in  they switched the event from september to july a move which was heavily criticised by a number of exhibitors who felt they should have had prior input and consultation   at the time of the  move eyebrows were raised at the press releases from rabdf with claims that the date change had been a huge success and that the main trade halls buzzed  last year one industry leader commented to ian he had seen more customers at his local car boot sale than were present on day two and that most of the people wandering around were in fact bored trade stand and cattle exhibitors     well next weeks two day event will be the last livestock event and in  the rabdf will revert to a one day event called the national dairy event on th september  at the nec   clearly with the now firmly established holstein uks dairy day show there simply isnt room for two specialist dairy events in england let alone two within only  days of each other  with the announcement that next years rabdf one day show will not include any cattle showing its a near certainty which of the two will be the first choice of dairy farmers   the two organisations are already in negotiations with a view to holding one joint event each year  if those negotiations fail one of the events is likely to be axed by  at the latest    given the rabdf event has had so many name changes in the past decade or so we reckon its at least five we are tempted to run a competition for the name of the  event    ppl

triggered a flurry of interesting emails to ian   the bulk of them came from suppliers to meadow foods who were keen for ian to highlight that the ppl increase only applies to the a deliveries which amounts to  of deliveries  a number of suppliers were keen to highlight the fact meadows b price during april and may has been under ppl  however the b price is expected to up around ppl to over ppl for june and rising    in addition a couple of readers questioned ians claim last week that meadow announced a ppl increase in   having checked our records and compared them with wwwmilkprices com the meadow price was increased by  ppl over a seven month period split as follows may ppl aug  ppl oct ppl and nov ppl  total ppl in the  month paynes dairies axe b litres  is that fair   th june  producers supplying paynes dairies have been informed that their b litres will be abolished and become  a litres with immediate effect from th june  some producers have rightly questioned whether this is how ab milk pricing is designed to operate  the reality is what should happen is the b price should lead the a price up and on occasions overtake it   charlie payne is coming in for some criticism with this latest surprise move having recently paid only ppl for b litres and as soon as the spot price is rallying today ppl he intends to buy all milk at a standard litre a price as well as require production profiles from producers   as stated in this weeks ahdb dairy market commentary b prices should be the first to move upwards  assuming they work as they were intended to  now it seems the ending to that sentence should be  work as they were intended unless the milk processor suddenly scraps alphabet milk pricing   arla and muller make the top  league   th june  the

will make its final collections from its  supplying farmers next thursday june th after which its doors close   recently the business has failed to pay its farmers anything more than what is almost certainly the lowest milk price and the final straw was a nett milk price paid to producers of ppl when the milk was delivered into yew trees new drier in lancashire at ppl  it is claimed that  if not all  sorn producers tendered their resignation because they simply couldnt take any more pain   the loyal producers some of whom have been with sorn for almost  years since it started wanted owner david shaw to share the pain and take a haircut on his margin but it didnt happen   ironically many of those sorn producers from july st will be supplying yew tree direct achieving ppl and trending upwards whilst some have joined first milk   one of the major problems sorn encountered was when their relationship with arla irretrievably broke down  had that situation been handled differently particularly in terms of a sorn margin haircut the closing of the doors next wednesday would likely not have happened   sorn farmers have been quick to alert ian to the fact that david shaw has stated that he is not selling his milk tankers and that they are bought and paid for  thats led at least one sorn producer to discuss the matter with his lawyer because he claims that earlier in the year a ppl milk price deduction for  months was taken by sorn to finance the purchase of a new lorry   lets all hope it all ends amicably peacefully and financially fairly for all involved in the shut down   milk price news flash     ppl milk price increase from meadow foods breaks the log jam early   th june  last week in this bulletin ian made it abundantly clear that the uk milk market is on the move and even suggested the possibility that the odd milk purchaser might announce an august producer milk price increase   well once again meadow foods have come up trumps by today announcing a ppl producer price increase split over two months with ppl from st july and the same from st august   this is a very important signal to other milk purchasers to step forward and pay farmers a fair share of what they are entitled to especially those involved in the liquid and spot market   back in  meadow shook the industry when they announced a whopping ppl price increase  they had correctly read the market signals then and only a fool would suggest that the bean counters in meadow have got it wrong this time   some milk purchasers will be desperate to rebuild their own balance sheets and would love to be able to delay producer milk price increases by a month or more well meadow has once again broke rank and announced that they will pay producers any extra as soon as they can now all eyes will be on who follows suit its a certainty that the two price drops for july st from cheese makers dairy crest and wyke must be the last and there will even be pressure on them to rescind part or all of their july cut its time to cut out the spin and for the market to follow meadows lead which ian believes is not only a uk first but possibly a european and world first price increase following this serious milk price crisis   simon chantler chief bean counter at meadow commented   we are starting to see the green shoots of recovery in the price we are able to pay for our milk and wanted to pass this on to our producers as soon as it was possible    although there is still some way to go before the pressure is lifted from producers we feel that the slowdown in eu milk production over the flush period a general tightening of supply are offering a better market outlook  these developments are the most positive we have seen for a number of months and this has led us to adopt a more optimistic position for the recovery of milk prices in the medium term     we know the last two years have been incredibly difficult for producers across the uk europe and the world and meadow foods hopes to be writing again soon to producers with further positive news on the market and milk price   ppl milk price reduction for dairy crestdavidstow producers  from

this means the net outcome to producers allowing for the extra ppl will be the following june st price cuts   ppl price reduction for haverfordwest lake district arran  campbeltown cheese suppliers ppl price reduction for the scottish mainland pool ppl price reduction for the midlands pool the resulting wwwmilkpricescom standard litre prices are still under ppl for liquid and ppl to ppl for manufacturingcheese so there is a lot of work to be done to lift member milk prices out of the relegation zone into those of the main pack  however just over  months ago most first milk producers knew they were staring down the barrel of a very large gun which would see the coop fold  things have changed since mike gallacher took to the helm and he knows he still has a lot of work to do but he should be over the worst part of the turnaround work or should we say what was on day one a rescue plan more signals that the bottom of this crisis is well and truly behind us   th june  a few weeks ago ian said we were at the bottom and since then all of the signals are pointing north commodity prices are moving higher and quickly they are moving a lot not that anyone would get this from ahdbs latest market bulletin which drably states in the headline that eu prices picking upa bit in the commentary it says that average monthly prices still showed little change although the feeling seems to be that the market has hit the bottom no ahdb wrong the market hit the bottom seven weeks ago and has been climbing ever since now prices are shooting up there are good reasons to talk the market up for your levy payers so come on get with it this is not what you would call cutting edge market intelligence ian has also stated that when major processors start to talk about holding prices for two or three months to give stability to their supplying farmers it would be a clear signal that the bottom had passed dairy crest have announced a ppl price drop for july with a guarantee that no further deductions to farm gate milk prices will take place until at least the end of september  well the reality is they and others know that the next move will be upwards and dairy crest along with others will soon be looking at a september milk price increase b prices should be moving up and are highly likely to overtake a prices within a few months until processors push the a prices up  ians best guess is that at least one of our major processors will go for a september price increase and possibly even an august one but thats perhaps a bit optimistic some of the july milk price cuts are a combination of needs as well as the fact processors know this is the last cut they can get away with ian is hopeful that arla and muller will not have to cut producer prices further and that their next move will be up farmers will need to have good memories as to whether their processor treated them fairly during this crisis and if they didnt the next  months will present opportunities to change processor thats certainly the case with sorn milk whose processors are leaving david shaw like rats jumping off a sinking ship as soon as they possibly can there are now a number of producers who were under notice from their current milk buyer to leave who are now receiving letters saying the notice is rescinded the next move will be a recruitment drive which could come by the end of the year there is a long way to go in what will be a long haul but at least  we have passed the bottom of the crisis smp volumes smash the intervention ceiling  th may  its a little over a month since the intervention door opened to a doubling of the tonnage it would accept a tonne ł  the new tonnage capacity of  tonnes was filled on th may and moves are already afoot to add more than  to a new ceiling of  tonnes  that sounds good but its a ridiculously high tonnage which still has to be sold out of store and will certainly check any recovery   milk production up   th may  according to ahdb dairy eu milk deliveries for the  month period to the end of february are up an eye watering    ppl milk price reduction for waitrose suppliers  from june st   th may  this takes producers standard liquid litre down to a healthy ppl   ppl milk price reduction for arla members  from june st   th may  its a  euro cents litre reduction equating to ppl for  arla members which takes their liquid standard litre price down to ppl including the current forecast th payment of ppl wwwmilkpricescom   will this be the last arla member price reduction   th may  its a hefty one at ppl and given the comments made at the din conference last week by peter giortzcarlsen head of arla europe its clear arla are successfully moving large quantities of milk from commodities into higher value branded products and there was more than a slight hint of optimism from the very positive looking carlsen that prices had reached the bottom  there was no doubt that carlsen is acutely aware of the financial pressure his  members are under   ians bet is this is likely to be the final arla member price cut but that does not mean prices will start to increase soon   all eyes will be on other processors next week to see who sticks or chances a further farm gate price drop  this market is fragile but privately virtually all processors who are in the real world acknowledge commodity prices have certainly passed their low point   sainsburys tender results in processor changes and swap shop for farmers  th may  when muller announced its plan to acquire dairy crests liquid business ian posed the question whether sainsburys would be comfortable having virtually all of its liquid and cream business in the hands of muller  the no answer comes as no surprise   it was a near certainty the retailer would bring in a third wild card processor to mix things up but few if any anticipated the introduction of two processors   the sainsburys farmer merrygoround will see medina south of england and tomlinsons dairies wales  cheshire area supplying milk to three sainsburys regions from july    its easier to get the popes mobile number than to get information on how the new arrangement is likely to pan out but the following will be very close to the reality of the new split   sainsburys have around  producers in its aligned sddg supplying circa  million litres of which more than  are currently under the muller umbrella with the remaining   farmers with arla   from july  muller will surrender four of the regions they currently service with two moving to tomlinsons one to medina and one to arla  this gives arla  regions    simple maths means an average region is circa  million although at least two of the switched regions are understood to be larger than  million litres and one is bang on  million   it is believed there are  sainsburys regions which leaves muller with  or   million litres and still the main supplier having lost four regions and close to  million litres   the  or so sddg farmers in the four regions will not be affected in terms of milk price but they will be requested to do a bossman transfer from muller to one of the three successful processors   in the case of the  or so who are involved in the bossman transfer from muller to arla they will be given the additional option to become arla directs or full arla members  conversely a handful of the existing arla sddg farmers will transfer to muller  for most of the former dairy crest sainsburys suppliers they will have been transferred from dairy crest to muller and now to medina or arla in less than  months   this could perhaps be interpreted that sainsburys support the dairy cooperative model more than their rivals tesco do   whats next in the liquid retailer merrygoround   th may  all eyes will now turn to the outcome of the ongoing lidl liquid milk tender and the coop ctrg liquid tender    muller currently supply almost  of the liquid milk to the coop ctrg and the lions share if not  plus to lidl  sods law says these tenders will result in more chaos and destruction as processors once again knock seven bells out of each other   fonterra raise its forecast farm gate milk price   th may  fonterra has increased its st june milk price forecast for the new season by  cents to nz  per kg milk solids which converts to ppl   many analysts had hoped predicted the opening price forecast would have been at  but understand why fonterra are airing on the side of caution   defra meeting to discuss the current crisis   th may  liz truss secretary of state for environment food  rural affairs was congratulated for hosting this weeks dairy industry meeting but she quickly realised whichever muppet or organisation who briefed her is not to be trusted in future    the meeting was held at nobel house in london involving representatives of the main processors dairy uk ec and european investment bank farmers and the nfu   unfortunately lizs opening comment was that the reason that dairy gb farming is struggling is because there is not enough processing capacity and investment in gb processing has been adequate   jaws were heard to hit the tables at which point dairy uk informed her that during the past  years a total of ł million had been invested in uk processing and that an unprecedented increase in global milk production was at the heart of the crisis   ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to dale farm   th may  this takes effect for march deliveries and reduces suppliers standard liquid litre price to ppl and for

th may  glanbia has written to producers to inform them that the previously notified ppl price cut for may st will be reduced to ppl   this takes producers standard manufacturing litre price to ppl as opposed to the planned ppl wwwmilkpricescom   in addition glanbia has capped its seasonality deductions at ppl reduced from ppl as additional help to its hard pressed suppliers  a rebate will be paid on april deductions to those who were deducted above the new ppl cap   the move has been interpreted as glanbia sensing a glimmer of light that commodity prices have passed the bottom see below   intervention stocks are rocketing  th may  when the commission doubled the smp intervention limit from  tonnes to  tonnes most believed that would comfortably get the eu dairy industry through the flush   well the way its going the new ceiling could be hit before the end of this month and last week a staggering  tonnes was placed in to store taking the total to  tonnes leaving only  tonnes which could be filled in less than two weeks  at this weeks din conference tom tynan from the eu commission confirmed that if the new ceiling is reached the commission will continue to support the dairy market but he didnt say at the same level   note the intervention price for smp is tonne or ł   world dairy markets have passed the bottom   th may  whilst few if any processors and traders are informing the town crier the conversations ian had at this weeks dairy industry news conference reinforced his belief that the world dairy commodity market has already passed the bottom   all the signals are pointing north especially the upward movement in dairy futures and the fact the dutch dairy board have this week raised all of their dairy commodity prices up  new zealands farm gate milk price pay out is also moving upwards  spot price in gb is not in single figures as some suggested and is ppl plus and we are now just past peak daily production  throw into the mix the increase in cull cow slaughtering and worldwide especially eu production cuts and it looks to be a certainty that the positive talk is fully justified   its positive news but its certainly not recovery and any road to recovery is set to be a long one  several are predicting average prices around ppl to ppl for the next  or even  years with most if not all believing ppl plus could be a once in a lifetime experience   anyone banking on recovery equating to ppl is likely to be very disappointed but miracles do happen like leicester winning the premiership   dairy industry conference din  th may  ian has attended most of the din conferences but never one where the room was packed to capacity with the majority of europes big hitters in the dairy industry keen to listen to the speakers   there was a positive buzz in the air at this weeks event tempered by the acknowledgement that farmers cannot continue at current farm gate milk prices and processors are also under the cosh   more on the conference in ians next dairy farmer article but for the  conference it looks like either a larger room is required or the ceiling on attendees could be reached well ahead of the main event   omscos claim to be the first into china is under attack  th may  omsco issued a press release this week which in its opening paragraph claimed   following a historic international partnership between leading global organic cooperatives organic valleycropp and the organic milk suppliers cooperative omsco the first shipment of uk produced organic uht milk has been delivered to china under this collaboration   according to ian this is factually incorrect because daioni from south wales have been exporting organic uht milk to china for at least four years   rather cheekily omscos pr spin doctors responded to ians request for clarification by claiming that the wording refers to the fact its a first for omsco since the collaboration with organic valley   daioni have subsequently confirmed that they have already raised a complaint with omsco and are seeking a correction and apology having read the press release as ian did   all eyes are now on other claims made by omsco to check for accuracy and possibly even a correction and apology from its pr spin doctors   its great news that omsco are continuing to find new markets outside the eu but they need to check they hold sufficient evidence to back up any claims   arla to incentivise farmers to convert to gm free feed  th may  arla believe they have a consumer driven market opportunity for milk and dairy products produced using gm free feed for which consumers will pay a premium   there will inevitably be some segregation and logistical issues to resolve but from work in germany it is believed its a commercial marketing opportunity which arla intend to capitalise on   the expectation is to pay invited farmers an additional  euro cent ppl a litre for gm free milk to defray the on farm cost of conversion for those who are interested   the money will also be paid to members who currently produce gm free milk for arla particularly those in sweden where all milk is produced with gm free feed   note arla are the biggest organic milk processor in the world and along with the other gm free milk it collects translates to  or arlas total milk intake as gm free     as the status quo  lyrics go

significant tonnage rumoured to be circa  tonnes of its own label cheese from arla in favour of scc which will be a major boost to the west wales coops expansion plans   currently the factory is geared to produce around  tonnes of cheese a year with further expansion plans in the pipeline  an orderly switch in suppliers is likely to be completed towards the end of this year or early  by which time arla will have emptied their stores of all cheese made on behalf of sainsburys so hopefully no surplus stocks to be offloaded as feared by some   up until last year scc supplied own label cheese to tesco on a time limited contract which was not renewed however it is believed that the tonnage involved in the sainsburys deal eclipses that of the tesco deal and in addition it is better quality

is in addition to the ppl paid by arla to enable members to fulfil the tesco supplier requirements   suspension of the ability to switch was instantly implemented by arla in early february when the news broke that arla had lost  million litres of tesco liquid business to muller  the argument put forward to the arla board was that immediate suspension was unfair without giving prior warning and that the right thing to do was to reopen the window to give producers one last opportunity to make the switch  however given the ppl bonus the likelihood is that very few will actually make that

april  in last weeks bulletin we highlighted the bizarre and irresponsible claim by defra that the average uk farm gate milk price for february had increased by ppl  compared to that recorded in january due to the arla th payment well it gets worse because the average farm gate milk price paid to dairy farmers in northern ireland in february was ppl when you do the maths this means defra are stating that the average february price paid to gb farmers was a staggering ppl or as near as damn it ppl   during the week defra have resisted all complaints and dug their heels in and stand firm on their figures   dairy industry journalist chris walkland has received an acknowledgement that his official complaint to the national statistics office has been received and is under considerationinvestigation   he like most others believes the reporting of the increase fails to meet the high quality standards required by defra   questions have also been asked as to the reaction from ahdb dairy whose remit is supposed to be to deal with market failure on behalf of its levy paying farmers its chairman gwyn jones has commented that ahdb dairy has no influence whatsoever with defra in this area meanwhile the nfu dairy are on mute which is very unusual for them they usually issue a press release if they change their toilet roll brand   the big question is are defra the big bad wolf they are all afraid of   the matter is now bringing into question defras credibility and its unlikely to disappear until defra hold their hands up and issue revised figures which reflect the real situation     big changes in new tesco cheese model  th april  tesco have completed their review of their cheese model and a new tcg  tesco cheese group model will be operating from th april    the new model will involve a market tracker based on a basket of cheese processors milk prices which are transparent and easy to calculate plus a ppl upliftpremium which is partly attributable to the farmers compliance with tescos farm assurance and welfare standards   the  farmers supplying parkham farms have enjoyed a tesco cost of production model for almost four years and have now been given  months notice that this ends on the th april  when the new tcg market tracker model will be used   first milks haverfordwest producers move onto the new model almost immediately in  days time on th april  note between september and april tesco have paid first milks haverfordwest producers a winter supplement which ends this month   the changes will not be welcome but looking forward the cost of production cop cheese model was unsustainable and its hoped the new model will be sustainable for all involved not just the farmers   put simply the supplement and the cost tracker were good whilst they lasted its a big cut for parkhams farmers but both first milk and parkham will want to remain on the tesco cheese bus   the likelihood is that the tesco cheese model would pay a farm gate price in the earlylow ppls including the ppl bonus today   the new model will instantly breed competition amongst first milk farmers because in  months time tesco plan to operate the model with a dedicated group of haverfordwest suppliers   that gives first milk a  month transition period to work out the detail and decide which of the  or so members will be on the tesco bus only the selected dedicated tescos farmers will receive the ppl bonus in  months time post the transitional period   the penny will drop very quickly with the realisation that the tesco cheese model is not one which automatically encourages production but one which pushes farmers to cut cost to be the best tesco by nature will want the best farmers and thats their direction of travel with their cheese and liquid models and those who dont want to listen or deliver will be dropped tesco have confirmed that they anticipated in excess of  dedicated producers from first milk and parkham will be involved in the cheese group by april  including all  farmers currently supplying parkham farms   the new cheese model will cover all tescos british hard cheese   note one of tescos competitors lidl are out to tender for cheese at the moment and thats making grown man cry   correction  apology  th april  ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to waitrose  from st april producer notified the resulting

according to defras latest uk average farm gate milk price calculation the average february milk price soared by ppl and  from  to a whopping ppl   ian and others have challenged both ahdb and defra over what they believe is a wholly irresponsible and totally misleading calculation but to date defra is digging their heels in and refusing to explain the numbers or back down while ahdb seems to be sitting back putting absolutely no pressure on defra whatsoever to review the figure in an email received by ian from defra they basically stand firm on the numbers   the ppl uplift predominantly originates from arlas th payment to members amounting to ppl the bean counters in defra have allocated all ppl around łmillion of arlas th payment to februarys milk income as opposed to spreading it across the whole year to the tune of around ppl at least arla and wwwmilkpricescom allocate the ppl across each month   frankly this is just ridiculous and irresponsible and paints a far far rosier picture of the dairying situation than is the case and sends completely the wrong signal to everyone at ppl the industry would not be in difficulty although losses would be made by many farmers still let alone be in crisis   so lets consider the implications  ffa held a march in london a few days ago and delivered a letter to the prime minister outlining the crisis the industry faces  david cameron will respond but if he sees the average uk milk price paid to farmers for february increased by ppl he will say whats the problem handley  ffa and farmers stop moaning and it doesnt look as if ahdb dairy wants to do anything about this absurd portrayal of the reality of the current crisis situation get a grip ahdb can you not see how serious this could be   once again first out of the traps and onto the case was george dunn and the tfa whose input and pressure is very professional and visible the farming press and media have also jumped onto the story   the issue is one of a number of dairy statistical errors defra have recently been pulled up on only this one puts its credibility firmly on the line as well as the market intelligence at ahdb in terms of its potency or impotency to persuade defra to issue a correction defra have now stated that they hope to produce a february average milk price excluding bonus payments by th april this is a very poor show given to obtain this

its farmers exactly how it is   th march  german dairy coop milchwerke berchtesgadener has circulated a very blunt flyer to its members which amongst other things features two highway stop signs   the poster basically instructs its members to   a   stop producing additional unwanted milk b   stop using milk powder to feed calves and to use raw milk   the flyer states that the coop has its back against the wall and all they can do with the extra milk is to sell it on the spot market for  cents ppl  it also states that the coop has seen deliveries from members increase by  and continuing to grow resulting in our dairy is now close to collapse and in the name of all members of our coop we request you reduce the milk supply   meanwhile gb production is on target to be up  for the year ending st march  with cow numbers up   first milk announce plans to convert around ł million loan capital into tradable shares   th march  first milk under mike gallacher have taken yet another bold step in a bid to reshape the business and this time its a complete reshaping of its capital structure   the move comes almost  months to the day since gallacher took up the challenge to turnaround the fortunes of the business and it is perhaps his biggest and boldest decision   total member loan capital is estimated by ian to be in the region of ł million and one of the key points is that by far the lions share belongs to existing supplying members  it is clearly the interests of those supplying members and the future of the business that gallacher and his new board decided to make the change   unless they were numerically naďve by february  at the latest all first milk current and former members had psychologically written off receiving any capital repayments  in early  the talk was that first milk were sinking quickly and most farmers were worried whether they would lose both capital milk cheques and be forced out of dairying with nowhere to go  a number feared the writing was on the wall and there was no one banking on capital repayments   gallacher surprised most by taking on a huge turnaround challenge and on this occasion had a straight choice  do we do whats in the best interests of the current supplying members and the business or whats in the interests of those who have ceased to supply   the capital restructuring announcement was made on the th march a week ago and ian has had a few enquiries from members but no complaints because most seem to understand the situation that the ł million loan capital is set against minimal nett asset value which could easily be in the region of p in the ł  put bluntly the situation whereby first milk continued to pay out the capital ł for ł was unsustainable   trading in the shares is some months away but if gallacher his team invest wisely in the business it should by default increase the share value   intervention ceiling is doubled   th march  the european commission has doubled the volume of smp which can be placed into intervention at the full price tonne to  tonnes  simultaneously it has lifted the quantity of butter which can be placed into store from  to  tonnes    the aim is to stabilise the market particularly through the imminent spring flush however the more product which goes into intervention stores the more drawn out any recovery will be because it has to come out of store on to the market within a relatively short time frame  hopefully the intervention price is at a level which will dissuade most if not all eu dairy farmers from producing more milk and ideally less   ahdb backs

excess of  of the uk trade in dairy and pigment but its in dairy where those involved in the uk dairy industry regularly appreciate its forward thinking regular updates alerts and market predictions   its dairy predictions and market outlook simply eclipse and dwarf the very basic outlooks produced by other organisations   for example in its latest edition it calculates that  of the milk cheque money goes to  of the dairy farmers with the expectation those   farmers will soon take  of the money the  farmers are those on   retailer aligned contracts tesco sainsburys coop waitrose ms nestle etc   in scotland the figure is closer to  going to  of dairy farmers    on a more amusing but never the less serious note there is an opening article in the ptfs latest dairy update headed             our father who art in heaven reporting that  representatives of the european milk board  members met his holiness pope francis in late january at the vatican where they were blessed and all prayed for divine intervention             hats off to them for doing something that doesnt involve tipping milk in the streets or burning tyres given that the almighty hasnt got much on his plate these days the job should be sorted quite soon commented walkland in the ptf bulletin   the author of the ptfs dairy report is chris walkland who will make a guest appearance at the nfu agm dairy break out session at its conference in  days rd  th february time where he will provide a dairy market outlook  update its sure to be hard hitting with no primary school basic analysis as to where the uk dairy industry is and what the outlook for the rest of  and beyond is    first milk pricing changes see the a litres increased from  to    th february  first milk has written to members confirming a schedule of pricing changes which take effect from april st   the key changes include the following   a the current a literage will increase from  to    b  a new milk price index will be utilised to track first milks price against its main competitors and will be independently audited by wwwmilkpricescom and reported to members on a quarterly basis   c the current complex matrix of milk price schedules will be cut and this will be simpler for first milk to manage and      easier for members to audit and monitor   d for members supplying first milks haverfordwest and lake district creameries there will be a transport charge ranging from zero to ppl according to the distance between the factory and the supplying farm   e move money will be paid for quantity and less on hygiene  there are more details on this to be circulated to members and whilst there will be winners and losers the nett overall effect to first milk are basically cash neutral  in other words its not a sneaky price cut but a re jig which is market related and visible      another disastrous gdt auction  tuesday nd february  todays gdt auction results were nothing short of a disaster with the

commitment to arla until at least   th february  there were concerns that following the tesco decision to switch around   to  million litres of their arla supplied milk to muller that other retailers would jump on the merrygoround piling further pressure on non aligned milk prices   whilst such pressure from asda cannot be completely ruled out they have at least reaffirmed their commitment to source all its circa  million litres of  fresh liquid milk from arla until    in addition asda has confirmed it will continue to support and promote the arla quality mark landed last year with a minimum price guarantee of ppl   given this commitment it must surely be fair to assume that as part of the new  year deal a minimum price at a similar level of around ppl will be part of the package

following several requests ian has decided to publish his response to the ahdb business plan  click on this link ian potter response   in addition kite consultancy have published their response click on httpwwwkiteconsultingcomgetattachmentcafdcdkitecommentsonahdbcorporateplanaspx   a couple of kites comments jump out at readers they kites clients think it ahdb dairy produces far too much information that is relatively basic focused on average operators   also many also believe that some of the intelligence work ahdb dairy carries out is a waste of time and resources  there is no need for market intelligence to report on general dairy news which is more than adequately covered by the general farming media industry websites and social media   in ahdb dairys news article published th january the commentary read   a recovery in prices to more sustainable levels for the whole supply chain is needed but when this will happen and how quickly relies on a combination of three key events a reduction in milk production the sale of excess stocks and a rise in demand this supports the view that it is indeed teaching grannie to suck eggs if a dairy farmer doesnt understand those fundamentals there is no hope   another comment in a previous report from ahdb diary stated that one of the really important findings in the report was that there is a big gap between current farmgate prices for aligned and no aligned fresh milk   as one farmer emailed  no shit sherlock and we pay levy money for this sort of commentary which is about as much use as tits on a bull   from emails ian has received there appears to be a significant number of levy payers who want to see ahdb dairy bin its  year plan and rewrite it in particular with an emphasis to support domestic dairy promotion assist with an export strategy help farmers in these unprecedented times to make tough decisions and big changes as well as up their game on communication and what is currently below average market intelligence commentary   ahdb states that  ahdbs dairy staff and board have been out meeting and listening to levy payers in scotland england and wales  well they might be claiming to listen but the jury is out as to whether its board will take any notice or change   one things for certain they are going to have to overcome their genetic phobia of associating themselves as the messengers for bad news when attempting to inform farmers of what they term as news   nfu vs ahdb   th february  in robert forsters excellent beef newsletter he recently referred to a disagreement between the nfu and ahdb which appears to be spearheaded by the high heels of presidential candidate minette batters her stance is evidently in contradiction to the position adopted by both the current and former nfu presidents meurig raymond and peter kendall  the snippet reads as follows     if meurig wants to calm the waters in the run up to the nfu presidential election by supporting his old mate kendall it could be his ultimate downfall  farmers across all sectors want someone who will stand up for them and make a difference   as a famous quote goes anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm   that sea is far from calm now so far as the uk dairy industry is concerned or ahdb and its three year plan   note minette batters semex conference comments feature in ians response to the ahdb dairy business plan click on the link ian potter response   ahdb dairy price reporting back on the radar   th february  din has highlighted the decision by ahdb dairys market intelligence analysts to cease publishing an average wholesale cheese price whilst continuing to publish the mcve price   given the fact anyone with any idea of how to add up can calculate the cheese price from mcve its a puzzle as to why publication of a key price like wholesale cheese has ceased   din commented that it is believed that ahdb dairy are not publishing a mild cheddar quote because they dont trust the market reports they are getting   ian questioned the cheese price quoted by ahdb in his october dairy farmer article he questioned ahdb over who they contacted for prices tonnes traded and how the average was calculated  alas the response was its commercially sensitive information  it appears that since that article no cheese price has been published   its likely that in obtaining their prices either ahdb analysts asked the questions in the wrong way leading to questionable answers or simply took shortcuts  similar concerns have been voiced over ahdbs bulk cream prices as to what questions are asked and to whom in arriving at the published prices   dairy uk publish its export strategy th february  dairy uk have published uk exporting dairy to the world where they highlight whats required to allow the industry to unlock the potential in international markets   in the report is a list of actions and recommendations that will boost our exports including creating a onestop shop for dairy exporters   farming minister george eustice commented exports are a crucial part of growing and strengthening the dairy industry and a key part of our plan is to see new markets opened so that the sector can become more resilient competitive and profitable   now how do the ministers words of encouragement fit with ahdbs three year zero budget to help exports and this strategy as it stands they dont and a revolt is brewing    jobs axed at arla  th february  arla has announced its global restructuring including a  head count reduction  staff involved are expected to all be consulted and notified by mid march   its a sad fact that across the world dairy processors of all sizes are cutting back on staff in order to remain lean and competitive   in addition to announcing its plan current head of arla uk peter giortzcarlsen will take on the new position as head of europe and his uk role will be taken by thomas pietrangeli who is currently in

shock surprise by britains biggest retailer tesco to switch up to  million litres of its tesco aligned milk from arla to muller has now been confirmed and its piled on the negative pr the tesco comms team will have to wrestle with   ian has exchanged emails with tesco and had several conversations with them as he attempted to obtain answers to basic questions for example   is the litreage involved circa  million when does the switch take effect whats the reason eg money quality service   all three questions are currently commercially sensitive and a secret however the switch will not take place until after the spring flush  so on the basis tescos track record is not to do anything for free one has to assume that money is changing hands as usually happens when big milk volumes switch          for gb milk its neutral for the chosen few in muller its good news for the rest it will further fuel the argument that the non aligned the have nots are subsidising the chosen few   many in the industry believed that mullers take over of dairy crests liquid division effectively making  liquid processors become one would be good news for the industry but following this move the jury is out   what it means for arla   st february  tesco have stated that the arla tesco direct farmers will be protected and continue to be aligned directly to tesco translating this must mean that if the  million or so litres arla retain of the tesco liquid business the tesco arla directs are protected  this means the  million or so litres arla has lost is a loss to arla coop members at the tesco price  more evidence that the non aligned are paying for the chosen few   this sounds very much like a deal has been struck to favour arla direct tesco producers which is certainly not one of the core foundation stones a coop is built on of working of working for its members   in addition tesco arla directs look likely to be one of the last dominos with the announcement of a ppl price cut and the real possibility that in  months time their milk will need to find another home unless this market turns north before then     arla now need to find a home for an extra  million litres of milk in addition with immediate effect no arla member can switch to become an arla directs or vice versa  this means whatever happens to the tesco arla directs they will not be able to join arla as members   lets hope the tesco move doesnt energise the liquid merry go round where the only people who cant afford the ride are dairy farmers   john beckett     st february  it is with great sadness we announce the passing of john beckett after a long and distinguished career in the agricultural industry   john was a highly respected director of belton cheese and recently retired as chairman of the family business   away from belton cheese john has been a champion for the dairy industry  he has been a past president of the royal association of british dairy farmers rabdf chairman of cheshire county landowners association and in  he became the chairman of nwf group for  years   in  john was presented with the royal association of british dairy farmers princess royal award  the honour was made for his outstanding services to the industry the following year john received the national agricultural award from the rase   the transformation of genus is probably one of johns greatest achievements in  john was appointed chairman and  years later the genus business became the biggest breeding company in the world trading in  countries  despite wearing many hats johns passion was to help young people acquire the business knowledge that he felt was lacking in some parts of the industry believing that if farmers are to compete on more equal terms they need to fully embrace the science of management   to this end john established the mba agrifarm charitable fund administered by the worshipful company of farmers which would enable enterprising farmers to study for an mba alongside executives from other sectors at the cranfield school of management  this is an initiative that will pay dividends for generations to come    john was also past chairman of the  cow club farmhouse cheesemakers ltd goodwins cheese ltd and m k richmond ltd john deere dealership he was a liveryman of the worshipful company of farmers and honorary fellow of royal agricultural

adjudicator gca christine tacon has today published her report into her investigation into tesco plc in terms of how britains biggest retailer has failed to comply with the supply code of practice her conclusion is simple tesco have seriously breached paragraph  of the code in her report she states she found evidence that tesco deducted or deferred payments owed to suppliers for goods with some payments taking up to two years to be paid by tesco in addition she saw instances where tesco overcharged or underpaid supplies without rectifying the matters it was clear from the evidence that a major focus of the tesco commercial team during the investigation was on hitting budgeted margin targets its a report full of examples about tesco charging extra fees delaying or failing to pay and for its buyers leveraging ie leaning on suppliers she concludes her report with five recommendations and i guess if she could add number six it would be for her to fine tesco for its breaches legally she cant tesco could be fined łm   th january  this comes on top of an ongoing serious fraud office investigation into the ł million tesco accounting scandal one city analyst has warned that tesco could face a ł million fine for the scandal the big question will be who will drastic dave lewis get to pay the tescos fines do leopards change their spots we shall see but they certainly dont change into pussy cats at the moment they look as if they have the morals of an alley cat     th january  britains biggest retailer but far from being its favourite tesco are having a pr kicking on a scale never seen before in the uk with any retailer drastic dave lewis ceo will be scratching his head with his bean counters as to how he can prop up his margins and pay the fines whilst turning in a healthy profit its a near certainty tesco will find a way for suppliers to pay for its errors and mistakes because that how the track record reads we had better hope pray and be ready to ensure that tescos dark forces dont try and recoup their fines lost margins and lost routes to margins by pickpocketing hard working dairy farmers in an already crippled dairy industry thats apart from its pampered directs whose bonus money indirectly comes from nonaligned farmers if they do the industry will have to put differences to one side and stand shoulder to shoulder to take them head on no

batters won over most of the audience with her measured professional presentation at the semex conference two weeks ago president meurig raymond will get his main chance at the nfu conference at the end of february who will have the nerve to go head to head with tesco because that is what is required and what will make or break the presidential bid career defining speeches beckon and the reputation of tesco and its allies in the supply chain are hanging in the balance will the next nfu president wear black lace up shoes or high heels either the way as the nancy sinatra song goes the

all milk processors have already decided to announce price reductions for st february or st march   there is simply no light at the end of this tunnel in fact the tunnel is getting longer each day  a group of farmers in scotland are reporting a current brutal ppl milk price and post st april it could easily be lower when they are forced to change the destination of their milk   add to this rumours of one or two extremely aggressive liquid processors one xl and one medium raiding existing contracts by offering eyewateringly cheap milk to attract new and existing customers and the end result is simply lower exfarm gate milk prices  its grim and its going to get a damn site worse   ahdb dairy market intelligence raises eyebrows  nd january  ahdb dairy attracted the attention of two eagle eyed potter bulletin readers with their news item produced by the market intelligence department   the top story was headed dairy market recovery rests on three key facts   it went on to explain that a recovery in prices to more sustainable levels for the whole supply chain is needed but when this will happen and how quickly relies on a combination of three key events a reduction in milk production the sales of excess stocks and a rise in demand   as one reader commented is this the sort of peter  jane market analysis our levy money pays for  heaven help the famers who hadnt

facility for an undisclosed sum  for first milk relieving itself of the burden to pay half the cost of running the westbury plant with a one off payment to arla of a few million will be good business and further evidence that mike gallacher is determined to turn the business around    westbury dairies limited is now  owned by arla along with the site which arla acquired in december    arla are now free to further develop the  million litre a year site where it currently produces anchor butter own label butter for retailers as well as powder   its a certainty that first milk do not require circa  million of balancing capacity with a maximum  billion litre member milk field only to lose money on every litre of milk processed through westbury  actually some might claim in doing so first milk were carrying a balancing charge and running half a plant to benefit the rest of the uk dairy industry   note going forward first milk have negotiated preferential access to the facility during the spring flush and at other times   the exit from the westbury joint venture is another smart  move by gallacher in connection with his  turnaround plan the savings from the exit form westbury should unlock milk price moves for members in the coming months   ian has also been reliably informed that first milk are now on the front foot and actively looking for additional milk in cumbria west

ceo of wt foods golden wonder and homepride foods and former nonexecutive director of duerrs jams and tangerine confectionery as well as his current role as chairman of peters foods which he retains   looking at his track record he certainly appears to know his way around the food industry and hasnt previously shied away from challenges he is badged as a selfmade down to earth man with experience and buckets of energy  on paper it should be considered a coup for first milk to get someone with sharpes pedigree and experience     meadow foods under attack th january  the nfus dairy

meadow foods will change how they pay suppliers from april st with the a price paid on  of producers  a quota allocation with any remaining production paid at the b litre price   is this a price cut a price adjustment that will be more or less neutral or will producers never know the truth   the reality is just like most if not all milk processors meadow simply has too much milk on its hands and a limited number of resignations andor farmers quitting  with this move meadow have decided to spread the risk across all producers making those who produce any b litres plus  off the a litres take the pain   if meadow are paying the a price on only  of the milk it should mean that the a price improves  if that happens the adjustment will be neutral and if the b price is say p those who produce the extra litres bear the pain until prices turn the corner and head north  at this point the b price will be the first move and will drag the a price up with it   only time will tell whether meadows a

a bizarre sexual attraction to tractors has been banned from the countryside and forced to sign the sexoffenders register ralph bishop  was found by police with his trousers around his ankles interfering with a tractor parked in a field outside saxmundham   he was arrested on suspicion of outraging public decency and admitted to having had sex with around  tractors all over the suffolk countryside   when officers searched his terraced home they found a collection of more than  tractor images on his laptop   the photos showed bishop had a special desire for john deere and massey ferguson tractors particularly green ones   a police insider said we couldnt believe it when we found him in the field he was wearing a white tshirt and wellington boots and very little else he was clearly in state of high excitement at the rear of the machine thankfully nobody else was around but the field is close to a village primary school so we had to arrest him and educate him about the error of his ways he told us he was particularly in to axle grease and the presence of this around the back of tractors was all too much for him bishop twice divorced was released without charge on condition he sought psychological help he was put on the sexoffenders register he is also banned from the countryside and is now not allowed to go within one mile of a farm the police insider added so he has to live and remain in the middle of ipswich to comply with that however we are watching him because we are worried about the safety of several streetcleaning machines another policeman added hell also need to keep away from the towns gardens  if he takes a fancy to a lawn mower he might find he loses more than just his liberty     real complaints to councils  you

commercial board   th december  at a special general meeting this week members unanimously approved first milk governance shake up which will see only two farmers on the board   the day of enthusiastic amateurs believing they have the necessary skills to help run first milk by sitting around the board room are finally over   for continuity its likely one of the two farmer positions will be filled by one of the existing farmer board members and the hunt is on for the second who could come from the existing board or could be a new face  whoever it is he or she simply has to come with a proven track record in the commercial world and not just in milking cows  gallacher has to have a very commercially focussed board and he is almost there   it is late for first milk to realise the serious damage its governance and management team has done in the past  to  years but as they say its better late than never and its time to turnover a new page for          what next for first milk   th december  the announcement of a new commercially experienced chairman should come in january   the goal for  must surely be for gallacher to significantly close the gap between first milks lower member prices and its competitive set  if signs of that appear in the first half of  the talk will no longer be whether first milk can survive but more that it will have turned the corner which some may claim has already happened in    there are signs of glimmers of hope for first milk but sadly in this environment they will come too late for some members     ppl milk price reduction for dairy

southern irelands november milk production     th december  this was the headline in an irish farmers journal article where estimates claim an additional  million litres of milk were processed in southern ireland in november compared to november   the range extremes used were  for the processor aurivo to  for dairygold   note in november  over production resulted in many dairy farmers cutting production and drying off cows early which a factor is contributing to the seismic increase   milk price prospects do not look great between now and  at  to ppl  th december  the european commission has published a report prospects for eu agricultural markets income    the report predicts the world will increase milk production by  million tonnes a year of more concern is the prediction that the eu is expected to be the area which will see the highest production increase and the highest world exports increase with around  of the extra milk produced in the eu going into powders for export whilst  will go into cheese this all means that the eu will account for almost a third of all dairy product traded on the world market so effectively as if we didnt realise it before the extra dairy products will have to be exported   of more concern is the expectation that for the next four years plus to  the average eu milk price will run between  to  euro cents kg or  to ppl at todays exchange rate with very slow recovery  from the current lows   arlas vision to  th december  arla has published its  growth strategy in which it anticipates its  members will increase milk production

values are expected to be  in europe and  outside of the eu   consultation is open on ahdb dairy business plan  to   ian urges dairy farmers are urged to have your say th december    ahdb including ahdb dairy has launched a consultation on its  year business plan and budget to  in which they are particularly interested in answers to the following questions   do you agree with the proposed activities for the dairy sector if not which activities will make the biggest difference to improving the competitiveness of dairy and why    what levy funded activity ies in your view could be stopped and why   do you agree that levy rates should remain unchanged for    any other comments you have on the plan   ian has studied the plan and was stunned to learn that if dairy farmers assume ahdb dairy is facilitating exports of surplus dairy products they can think again their current budget to help dairy exports is a nice round jawdropping zero nothing and nowt   it is the only ahdb sector that fails to have a budget to assist exports the other five ahdb sectors eblex cerealsoilseeds horticulture pork and potatoes all show an average łm a year allocated to export development until  yes thats a total łmillion a year compared to the black sheep of dairy which hasnt allocated so much as ł   in the  year ahdb dairy received total nett income of ł million and spent ł million levy payers are urged to send even a brief email with your thoughts as to whether you believe ahdb dairy will invest the levy tax to deliver the maximum benefit to you based on the plan and budget   the dairy board and its chairman have to be challenged as to whether their plan is the best way of spending the money and with increased milk production they should surely be asked why they have decided not to allocate any funds to promote dairy consumption domestically or to exports if invested professionally and correctly this is very likely to enhance the profitability of all british dairy farmers there is no demand creation plan at home or abroad but presumably the ahdb dairy board have good reasons for this   i am beginning to question whether the ahdb dairy board fully understand the implications of having a strategy to produce more milk ie the current one without having a strategy one to actually deal with it  at least we all know they have a strategy to ensure they spend all of the extra levy money they collect  do they actually know which direction the uk dairy industry is heading   instead processors are having to explore exports in their own whilst farmers produce milk at  year record levels   back in  northumberland sheep farmer graham dixon took on eblex on behalf of group of sheep farmers when he stated we want more say in how our levy money is spent  we must direct more of the levy money towards a new marketing and promotion campaign the result was a joint attack by eblex to bolster both exports and promote consumption of lamb by our own domestic consumers   ian also believes ministers should be looking at the budget and plan before they sign it off  the secretary of state claims she stands behind exports but there is no real substance to her claims both defra and ahdb are keeping their hands firmly in their pockets   its ironic that ahdb have declared that they are picking out the best bits from each sector and rolling them out across the piste yet this doesnt appear to have affected the dairy sector where they have ignored export development completely   alternatively you might have a view on the necessity or not for ahdb dairy to continue to spend significant amounts on genetic and genomic evaluations when a number of competent private operations are already at the cutting edge of this field is this a case of using levy money in areas which are already been adequately serviced by others   as one person commented to ian this week ahdb dairy needs grabbing by the scruff of the neck on this issue and it needs some real leadership   ian will be making a submission to ahdb on its dairy business plan and hopes all of you will too even if its only a few lines by email  he has tried to contact both its chairman gwyn jones and its strategy director on the export issue both opened the email a week ago but neither has found the time to respond   this consultation closes at  hours on wednesday  january   responses can be submitted by email to ruthashfieldahdborguk or via post to ruth ashfield ahdb stoneleigh park kenilworth warwickshire  cv tl   allegedly feedback from this consultation will be considered when the plans are finalised in january before submission to ministers for approval   a copy of the ahdb dairy business plan is available at

it stated that the business had continued to be loss making to the end of september  the coop has announced that it has made a small profit in the same period it made an operating profit of łmillion compared to a loss of łmillion in the corresponding  month period in the previous year  it has also declared that it anticipates its full year end results will return a profit at st march  the reason for the difference in the two versions is that in the end of year accounts they included figures for the exceptionals whereas this latest announcement is restricted to the day to day activities excluding the one off costs   during the same six month period debt excluding member capital contributions has reduced from łmillion at st march to łmillion at the end of september   ahdb appear to have grown some hairs and dare i say balls with a refreshing up front analysis of  first milk financials   they have pointed out in their news section that its effectively the farmer members who have taken the pain which has resulted in the six month profit declaration in other words its the significant farm gate milk price cuts which are the main reason for the turnaround   ahdb estimate that in the six month period april to september  the milk price paid to first milk members was ppl plus adrift from its competitive set  note the set does not include retailer aligned cop milk prices   this ppl figure compares to the same period in  when the gap was less than ppl the difference to the half year financials of a milk price gap of ppl to that of ppl amounts to ł million so in effect if first milk had continued to maintain a ppl or less difference between its paid out milk price and that of the competitive set it would have shown a łm loss but as it is that loss has been shouldered by the members in the form of a much lower milk price   ahdb comment it appears that from april to september  a big part of fms turnaround in fortunes was achieved by passing lower prices onto its farmer members   for the story click on this link httpdairyahdborguknewsnewsarticlesnovemberfirstmilkturnaroundprogressvlcgyknym   first milk sells kingdom foodsglenfield dairy business   th november  first milk has agreed to sell its struggling glenfield dairy business aka kingdom cheese as a going concern to rapidly expanding scottish family business grahams for a yet to be disclosed sum   the business was acquired by first milks ceo kate allum in may  for łmillion which included łmillion towards an outstanding loan   at the that time the employees numbered  and when the sale is completed in the next few days the staff head count transferred to grahams will be  which is a big chunk of first milks  head payroll when it reduces to     the business predominantly produces cottage cheesesoft cheese and quark and has some key retail customers for example ms  asda   the venture has archived next to nothing for first milk during its ownership and is estimated to have lost in the region of łmillion a year   its no secret that the plant requires significant investment to remove some of the labour intensive operations on that score either grahams will attract some funding to make the improvements or alternatively they will surely be weighing up the costs of moving some of the useful kit to their new greenfield site project   in terms of milk supply from the day that grahams take over they will utilise their own milk leaving first milk to find a new home for their extra milk which is unlikely to be an exciting profitable prospect for the first half of    first milk what next    th november  the fact that the finances show a small profit is perhaps the first real evidence that after almost  months at the helm ceo mike gallacher is starting to visibly demonstrate that his mission is to turn the business around this will undoubtedly be encouraging to first milk members and the expectation is that further positive news will be forthcoming very soon and likely next month  this includes an announcement on a new chairman who must surely be very commercial a different board structure with less farmer involvement and more commercial experience the outcome of the refinancing deal with the barclays and lloyds and further divesting of interests allowing gallacher to focus on his core business of making quality cheese for adams to sell these are just some of the announcements members are  waiting for   at the same time as all of this is going on he desperately needs to deliver a significantly improved member milk price  for sure all of these deals take time to put in place and time isnt a luxury gallacher has on his side however for those who were circling like vultures believing there would be some first milk easy pickings to be had they will now realise gallacher may have come to the table late but he is setting his stall out to slim down and turnaround the business rather than let it sink during his watch  he has a lot of work to do and a long way to go but the indications that he both has a plan and will execute it   only  lucky farmers are set to receive their bps payment next week  th november  the rpa has announced that

 with farmers for action once again giving retailers a beating to try and get them to pay more money to farmers comes news this week that morrisons has had a beating for wait for it paying more money to farmers via its successful milk for farmers brand   and starting the beating was none other than the magazine which says it is working for your farming future ie  the farmers weekly in an article on the th november philip case wrote that a supermarket shopper has accused morrisons of misleading the public over its premium milk brand  note only one complaint from a so called consumer  he went on to write about something every arla farmer has known all along in that the additional money raised goes to all arla farmers across europe and not just to uk ones   what he didnt say was that all of arlas product revenues such as the brand giant lurpak was also spread across uk farmers and not just with danish farmers where the product is made he also printed on line the extensive exchange of emails from the shopper who is mr brown from derby who has since confirmed he has lodged a complaint with the advertising standards authority   the story was then pickedup by the sunday telegraph on the th november and subsequently by other news outlets including the farmers guardian   thus in one fell swoop through a wholly irresponsible piece of journalism that does nothing for any dairy farmers future the farmers weekly has potentially compromised not only the morrisons milk brand but other such schemes as well which could have put more money in farmers pockets   with regards to the article in todays farmers guardian it is more balanced than the very one sided view printed in farmers weekly  however i do take issue with their claim the chain has received a barrage of criticism from farmers who said consumers had been duped into thinking the extra money would benefit only uk producers  i dont believe the farmers guardian hold sufficient evidence to back up the use of the words a barrage of criticism because one complaint is hardly a barrage  also is the use of the word duped correct   morrisons have  million customers a week one complaint   of its weekly shoppers and the farmers weekly made a story out if it shameful   no doubt all of this will give ffas protestors much to talk about as they wait on the picket lines in the cold until the early morning hours  a sponsored coach trip and picket line outside fws hq at quadrant house surrey is now under consideration     whats good for the goose is good for the gander  th november  on the th october this bulletin reported on the onset of dirty tactics against morrisons milk for farmers brand and reported on the twitter activity from the midlands milk company nemi milk made by the feed company independent feeds ltd it accused the morrisons brand of misleading consumers and posted tweets comparing the brand and arla to fifa and even sending liz truss messages about someone milking british public emotions and the uk dairy crisis the milk is shameful the marketing illinformed and arla is a coop who deliberately misleads it is a scandal   since then a richard brown from derby who has a lifetimes experience of farming has admitted on facebook that he has submitted a complaint to the advertising standards authority over the milk see above story with friends like these who needs enemies although it has not been proven yet there is a strong suspicion that there is a link between richard brown and nemi milks  independent feeds boss andrew henderson who denied on twitter that he contacted trading standards whether they know each other or not really doesnt matter however both clearly have a gripe that milk for farmers is misleading the asa will no doubt rule over time whether the brand or the marketing is or isnt   misrepresentation or elaboration of any facts surrounding a product would of course be the last thing that anyone in the industry would want   to that end therefore ian is now questioning the credentials on which nemi milk is marketing its milk as britains first natural antioxidant plus milk and milk that is naturally enriched with selenium   under eu rules all health claims on food products have to be approved by the eu of course currently claims for antioxidant properties are notauthorised which makes nemis claim somewhat er suspect for selenium a claim may only be made where the increase is at least  compared to a similar product   needless to say the necessary investigations have been out in train to make sure that the claims nemi milk is making also do not mislead consumers if they do then that will naturally also have to be a matter for the advertising standards authority or trading standards to investigate after all whats good for the goose is good for the gander     with friends like these who needs enemies   th november  with farmers for action once again giving retailers a beating to try

to łm loss in    tesco reviews will result in casualties and opportunities   th november  the tesco sustainable dairy group tsdg have completed their review of the milk purchasing scheme the result means opportunities for the best and casualties in terms of the loss of their tsdg contract for the poor performers   one of the key outcomes is that in future all tsdg producers will be core producers with no seasonal producers and all will be measured and rated annually on a traffic light system   those who fall into the bottom  as the worst performing suppliers in terms of animal welfare standards milk quality environmental management carbon foot printing and generally engaging with their customer tesco will be given six month notice of contract termination   once notice is served there will be a three month period when tesco will support these farmers in an attempt to improve their performance and score rating if after that period they have not achieved the required standard they will be axed three months later   conversely the top performing  will received an extra  base litres of production allocation which will be an annual award with the extra literage predominantly coming from suppliers who exit as tesco suppliers either voluntarily or who are axed   tescos two key liquid suppliers arla and muller wiseman will now compile a waiting list for the  new core producers who are required the list will be evaluated on a combination of geographical location and a score card whilst current tesco seasonal producers estimated to be circa  have a slight advantage in getting onto the waiting list many will fail the geography test and the expectation is that completely new tsdg suppliers will be required to make the numbers up in addition a tesco youngnew entrant reserve pool will be created   participation in promar costings could be considered optional in terms of if you dont want to participate in the costings you are free to supply another buyer but not tesco  so its compulsory for tesco suppliers and whilst the ppl payment towards promar will be stopped it will be replaced by a standardized paymentsubsidy per farm   cop budget prices will change from twice a year to four timesevery quarter so far as the three fs are concerned   tesco utilize a qvis quality value innovation and service score card as a transparent measure to rate all its suppliers and now it will be tailored to dairy   finally the processor price matching clause is to be removed from the contract in the event the non aligned price eclipses the tsdg price   the idea is to bring the bottom up for those who want to engage it wont all kick off overnight but  will be when the starting whistle is blown by tesco and a league table of producers will be created those in the relegation zone after one year will drop off unlikely to be offered a second chance as will those who refuse to provide promar with their costings    overall most farmers will realise its time to put up or exit as tesco suppliers if they cant achieve the standards we have asked a handful of key questions about the new ideas to tesco to which we await a response which we will report back on    hours in the life of david handley from praise to police  th november  farmers for action founder members david  marilyn handley have been threatened and intimidated by a  year old staffordshire dairy farmer who also claims to be a spokesperson for breakaway group united action for real farmers   the threat came by text message and whilst it was a long text the relevant sentence read    i will be in your yard within hours to ram them where the sun does not shine the threat was in relation to retired ffa committee member paul rowbotom who it appears is central to the breakaway groups organisation   during recent weeks the handleys have been the subject of a number of playground taunts on social media from the breakaway group but now at least one has turned to threatening behaviour   its similar to the s when in football we had small groups called firms who were convinced they were the best supporters and anyone who got in their way got a good kicking   only  hours earlier the handleys were a topic of conversation around a table of dairy industry leaders where marilyn handley was once again referred to as the unsung hero of the  uk dairy industry and david was congratulated for what he and his ffa team  committee had achieved with retailers in recent months lets be honest if you were david handley you would be asking do i really need this sort of aggro from a handful of mavericks who by their own admission were not very long ago staunch supporters and admirers of his efforts many would say stuff this and walk away   we have the contact details of the farmer whose mobile phone was used to send the text as do the police and we are hoping it was sent without thinking we contemplated exposing the details but at this stage it would only fire up more trouble for those involved    if you have any comments email us so we can gauge the responses because threats of violence we believe cross the line  in addition we understand the farmers   milk purchaser is likely to be questioned as to whether it condones this behaviour and whether such threats are a breach of his milk contract  if the farmer involved wants to communicate his thoughts   we are happy to listen to his version alternatively consideration of an apology wouldnt be out of place if he feels one is appropriate retailers will be laughing their heads of at the fact our most passionate dairy farmers who want to make a difference are squabbling and posting inappropriate messages on social media about the handleys come on lads handley surely cant be the enemy its a sad state of affairs   scottish dairy farmers to give their views on repatriation of ahdb dairy levy  th november  following on from a lively well attended dairy meeting organised by mole valley and snfu in coylton this week the suggestion to poll farmers views at the agriscot event on th november regarding repatriation of scotlands producers ahdb dairy levy is on the card   northern irelands dairy farmers do not pay the ahdb levy however they do pay a levy for milk promotion which is topped up by milk processors  whilst ahdb would argue that repatriation of the levy money wouldnt raise enough money the fact is in northern ireland they still succeed in raising and spending more money for milk promotion than ahdb do in the whole of great britain   speaking at the event industry journalist chris walkland emphasised the great story there is behind the scottish dairy brand and believes scotland should sell its brand by adopting the ni model with money coming from either a new separate promotional levy or by having promotion money coming out of repatriated ahdb levies where the money comes from is one for scottish farmers to decide on he said   a straw poll by the meetings chairman of the dairy farmers in the room showed that when asked how many of you believe ahdb do a good job and are value for money not one hand was raised   gaff of the week goes to oliver mcentyre barclays bank national agricultural specialist   th november  thank you to the readers who were keen to alert ian to a quote in the latest holstein uk journalnewsletter   the barclays national agricultural specialist stated    from high input high output systems to low input low input milk from grass systems large herds to smaller ones from the uplands to the lowlands the cost of production reaches towards plitre in some cases   so with the current tesco cop over ppl is this not simply and extremely unhelpful comment  was this ppl a typo or for real   chinas ending of its one child policy is big news for world dairying  th november  china has announced its one child policy will end and with it comes the expectation that up to  million extra babies will be born every year leading to an estimated  to  boost in chinas demand for infant formula as produced by the likes of dairy crest and arla  the move from the one to two child policy will happen in march      ppl milk price reduction for glanbia suppliers  from december st   th october  this is likely to result in a standard litre price of ppl glanbia have also announced a review of their volume bonus schedules to apply from april st one or two emails to ian have suggested that in the current environment a review means a negative adjustment this is a bold and negative assumption and is by no means automatic   ppl milk price reduction for dairy crest davidstow suppliers  from december st   th october  this takes producers standard litre price to ppl wwwmilkpricescom  note this reduction comes with a guaranteed

tonnes from france and lithuania   the uk has placed  tonnes of the total  tonnes put into intervention with the last consignment from the uk in early august  eu wholesale commodity prices are gradually trending north which will be the key influencing factor   arla uk report losses of łm    th october  first milk certainly arent the only uk processor to report losses  arla foods uk division clocked up łmillion in losses in   note that is across a  farmer pool of which  are in the uk who supply  billion litres uk share  billion litres  so on a ppl basis its tiny   new zealand milk production   th october  new zealand has now passed its peak production and nationally output is plummeting with september down  on september    glanbia is unlikely to be good news   th october  glanbia has announced the temporary closure of its state of the art kilkenny powder plant which was officially only opened in march  the milk will now be diverted into one of its cheese plants  the move is due to low returns on powder and anticipated better returns on cheese  this means up to  million litres of milkday is now going into irish cheese although production is much lower and the plant can be used on a seasonal basis which could be a factor in the shut down   lets hope the move does not result in any more irish cheese landing at our ports   first milk agm  th october  surprisingly the number of first milk members who attended yesterdays agm was similar to numbers attending in previous years and certainly estimated to be under  actual member producing farms   another surprise to some was that none of the existing farmer board tendered their resignations or announced they will stand down when requested to do so  however some are almost certain to recognise they have to shoulder part of the responsibility for the mistakes made and follow chairman sir jim paice with dignity rather than believe they are candidates for reelection to the new board which desperately needs commercial experience   there will be an sgm in december to adopt the new governance proposals following which first milk aim for a new slimmed down board to be in place for st february   at yesterdays agm a new farmer board member robert craig was elected as a nonexecutive farmer director and farmer jim baird was reelected to a similar position   sir jim paice stood down as chairman to be replaced by vice chairman nigel evans who stands in as interim chairman  so for the next three months and during the renegotiation of the banking facilities the first milk board is more farmer orientated than before which must be a concern  as one person commented gallacher desperately needs a board focussed on the business not the farms and farmers   the great british game fair is born   th october  hot on the heels of the announcement that after  years the cla game fair had admitted defeat and closed its doors comes the welcome news that a new day event at belvoir castle leicestershire will take place on ndth july     all of the articles below all relate to first milk and were posted on our website earlier this week   first milks accounts and annual report are grim reading   th october  ian takes little pleasure in writing about first milks financial results but its members will take no pleasure from seeing them  on receipt of the accounts he faced two choices    take the easy route and skim the results saving a heap of time and money or    take a detailed look and report his observations and the facts as he sees them to his regular readers  his conclusion was to go for option  mainly because he feels he owes that to readers especially the fm members who find the delving challenging as well as depressing  he wont receive any christmas cards from either the first milk board or management but the details are there for members to study and what is in the report needs to be aired   below are bullet points relating to the coops accounts to st march  which ian has pulled together with limited commentary highlighted in blue  note all comparison figures relate to the changes in the past  months the detail is sobering nay grim and should stimulate significant discussion at the agm this thursday th for those who want to check the facts ian urges them to put these accounts before their accountants requesting their comments and questions  the facts are these turnover was łm down  from łm   łm loss due to cheese quality issues this is huge and unforgivable but at least the new management team quickly accepted it and have put in place strategies to improve balance sheet reserves down from łm to łm the numbers also confirm that fm held łm of members capital retentions at st march  with only łm assets to set against this figurethere must surely be a case that the business should specify the capital repayment amount due from members who no longer supply them as a debt to the business this should be separated from the capital held from members who still supply milk  the way it is currently accounted for it is not transparent capital repayments to leaving members delayed by one year to march  following which they are to be spread out over  years  this added łm to the pot  the harsh reality which most members already realise is that the likelihood of members receiving any repayment of capital is slim  member capital retentions were increased from  to ppl from december  to august   this adds łm to the financials if fm still handle  billion litres of members milk  in addition the member capital limit rose from ppl to ppl barclays and lloyds will provide a finance facility until st february   the facility is payable on demand so first milk depend on the two banks continued support the facility available at st march  was łm the directorsboard state the current facility may need to be supplemented with additional borrowing and funding during this year the existing bank loans ideally need to be extended renewed or replaced this year  there is no time for christmas to get in the way if they arent then the new year leading up until february will be a very tense and uncertain time pretax loss of łm compared to a loss of łm but excluding one off exceptional costs in the year it was a loss of łm compared to a surplus of łm the year before during the year fm consistently paid one of the lowest farm gate milk prices to members but it still paid more out than the business generated  in other words fm should have cut the price they paid for milk harder and sooner to perhaps the tune of towards an extra ppl throughout the year   producers milk payments continue to be delayed by  weeks which has given the business around a łm cash flow benefit these delayed payments continue to favour the bankers at the expense of the members a ł write off for a loan with first milk energy limited poor financial performance of the cnp business acquired in  resulting in a significant reduction in the businesses valuation and a łm adjustment charge in the accounts its a head scratcher to understand how come fm has ended up paying the farmer owners of the cnp business an extra ł when the value of the business is impaired  the cnp business has now cost fm łm and it recently lost its team sky contract probably because it couldnt afford to renew it this purchase must rank as one of the worst acquisitions ever in the british dairy industry even top trumping dfobs acquisition of the acc business the pensions liability is a huge millstone around fms neck and is something former ceo kate allum tried to reduce in negotiation with government in  nett pension liability is up from łm to łm and growing at an alarming rate and needs to be funded according to the accounts fm are paying łm a year but this simply has to increase or the deficit will continue to increase unless someone can wave a magic wand kate allums total pay in the year was ł and sir jim paices was ł nice work if you can get it directors and former directors continue to resign to supply other processors fm own  of westbury dairies limited with arla owning the remaining shares this now looks to be a liability as opposed to an asset to fm however the volume of milk travelling from scotland to westbury is a concern if fm were to exit westbury staff numbers down from  to  ˇ         fm have spent łm reviewing the financial position of the business along with its future prospects that must be ł plus per current supplying member or ppl plus  where was it spent and what real tangible value has it delivered   in summary we refer to the auditors report on page   the group incurred a loss of ł million during the year ended  march  and continued to be loss making for the six month period to  september  additionally the groups and the societys bank facilities are payable on demand and are available until  february  as set out in the directors report and note  to the financial statements the ability of the group and the society to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon the adequacy of the bank facilities and the continued support of their lenders achievement of forecast financial performance and securing financing for the period beyond the expiry of the current facility these conditions along with the other matters explained in note  to the financial statements indicate the existence of material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt upon the groups and the societys ability to continue as a going concern this requires no further commentary both the auditors and the directors cast doubt over whether the business can continue as a going concern mainly due to the need to renew the banking facility and to meet its financial performance projections note ian is not an accountant and no one should rely on this analysis as advice it is ians assessment based on recent fm publications no representation or warranty is provided as to the accuracy of the information and it should not be used as a basis to make on farm decisions  however it could be used by members when questioning the board and management of fm if they so wish was first milks claim  slightly better than breakeven the reality th october  in its rd july members newsletter fm claimed the following   april  may resulted in a slightly better than breakeven position june is expected to be similar pl is being run at marginal breakeven to ensure that milk price is max we can afford first quarter results is a critical milestone and demonstrate the impact of changes so far   was this the reality though and the truth or did it make a profit in april may and june only to lose more than it made in july august and september the report issued today clearly states that the business has continued to be loss making for the sixmonth period to th september  in addition at that time losses were stated to be around łm but at the end of the day were  greater at łm   first milk board lambasted in governance report  th october    first milk has also announced its action plan following its overdue independent review  they key points are a  page independent review by greenburn into the governance of first milk has effectively lambasted its current board  in short it is distressing reading especially the time line on pages  to  for fm members but at least the grim facts are now out in the open   the conclusion is unambiguous in that its farmer board is left wanting  the report states there have been severe short comings in governance both at board and senior management level for a number of years this includes failure to follow conventional business practice in a number of ways   it goes on to say   the board of directors lacked the collective knowledge and experience to successfully navigate the business forward  and it refers to a catalogue of inadequate accounting systems   the board are ultimately responsible for ensuring the cooperative has a strong and sustainable business   the authors question whether the board managed the ceo or was it the other way around  they refer to the perceived lack of competence at board level the boards inability to understand the financial information provided and the protracted decision making   the report refers to a lack of leadership from the board   this report is set to go down in the uk dairy industry history books along the lines of the famous myners report for the cooperative  its hard hitting and leaves nowhere for those involved to hide frankly few if any of the current farmers members of the first milk board should be up for reelection   the key recommendations are   ˇ         the board will be reduced from  to  with an independent commercial chairman ˇ         going forward an elected farmer council of  members will represent the farmer owners ˇ         farmer board members will reduce from  to  with the aim of bringing in more commercial board members  one of these farmers will be vice chairman   ˇ         given the incompetence of the existing board few if any are likely to be required under the new structure as board members   first milk continues to fail despite the recommendations of the governance report  th october  the final insult for fm members is their continued failure to adopt good practices members have been given less than a week to study the accounts and the report ahead of the agm  one scottish member spoke to ian today about this and he was extremely unhappy highlighted in the governance report it confirms that in may  a review of fms financial governance stated that the monthly reporting pack is often released for review too late in the month for there to be any effective analysis done prior to board meetings  in some cases only  hours before a meeting to give farmer members less than a week must surely be inadequate given the state of the finances and the situation their coop faces so where is the good news  th october  the reality is that there is no good news in these reports other than the fact that that the senior management have gone and a new team are in place have they got the skills to turn this business around have they got the time we wont know until january  when we find out about the financing there isnt much time at all   snap to

christmas are equally anticipated   muller get green light on dairy crest acquisition but   rd october  uk competition  markets authority cma have given the green light for muller wiseman to acquire dairy crests liquid business having accepted the undertaking that medina dairies will have the facility to toll processes up to  million litres of milk a year at dairy crests severnside factory in gloucestershire  the deal will be completed on or before th december     in a statement whilst the ł million price paid was reconfirmed it was accompanied with a ł million allowance which was attributed and dumped on the cmas modified undertakings   this is a staggering figure and in simple terms if medina were to process the full  million litres a year for five years the ł million deduction equates to ppl   the more likely reason for a sizeable part of the deduction is that in addition to the modified undertakings with medina dairy crests liquid business profits and performance has deteriorated and part of this deduction is due to this hidden factor  however dairy crest will still be delighted at the nett ł million and to be out of the liquid business by the year end allowing them and others to focus on their cheese business which is sure to be open to offers in  from european hunters   dairy crests shares were under ł a year ago and on the announcement jumped to ł yesterday   medina what next  rd october  medina will have the facility to use the toll processing for up to  million litres of milk but this does not mean they will utilise the full facility during the  to  year period however medina are ambitious and intend to continue to grow their existing business    medina stated to ian its strategy is find customers st milk sourcing nd   ian believes this is very sound business policy and one some dairy farmers should take note of    dairycoahdb dairy yesterday suggested in their commentary that the medina involvement means medina will likely need milk close to the factory to achieve it  farmers should be ready to compare any offers    medina have confirmed to ian that this is pure speculation  first job is for medinas commercial team to secure new long term sustainable business  they then have the option to process their existing farmers milk at severnside or take milk from muller wiseman or a hybrid of the two  recruitment of new milk suppliers whilst possible is not on their radar so please dont form an orderly queue because its likely to be a long wait   b price milk watch  rd october  let us have your

shelves  th october  firstly ian has to eat a large slice of morrisons own brand humble pie and apologise for the fact he initially doubted the wisdom of the morrisons milk for farmers brand and indeed referred to it as a gimmick   the new milk was on the morrisons shelves on time and sales are flying so much so that they caught processor arla and morrisons out who both underestimated its likely popularity the office has had several emails reporting of empty shelves with store managers receiving complaints from customers that the milk was unavailable   initial sales are accounting for close to  of all morrisons liquid sales with the ppl premiumppl extra for a  pint carton going to farmer members of arla only   ian has made enquiries and morrisons have not taken any money out of the farmers pot to cover marketing or design and have stumped up the money from their own coffers   in addition if the situation should arise whereby close to sell by date milk for farmers has to be discounted this cost is shouldered by morrisons and not the farmers so the farmers still receive the extra ppl   so the early indications are that consumers are willing to pay an extra ppl and if all of this carries on for the long term its a winwin for the arla boys   next on the supermarket shelves should be morrisons own label cheddar which will sell for a ppl per pack premium equivalent to ppl  if and when you spot it please send us the details   dirty tactics on morrisons milk  th october  the success of the morrisons milk for farmers appears to have aggrieved a few people and brought the industrys dark side into play    welcome to the bulletin for the first time andrew henderson from crewe cheshire md of a small liquid milk business nemi milk dairy nutritionist and owner of a feed firm called independent feeds limited hes well known to some farmers on twitter as nemi milk and for his love of arlabaiting having posted charming tweets comparing the morrisons brand and arla to fifa and even sending liz truss messages about someone milking british public emotions and the uk dairy crisis the milk is shameful the marketing illinformed and arla is a coop who deliberately misleads it is a scandal   if that isnt enough he has picked a fight with david handley and told him that he has requested trading standards investigate the morrisons brand the claims are the initiative and its delivery are illegal and the move could single handed stop the initiative there is a possibility it could be withdrawn from sale pending an investigation if this happens it will enrage arlas dairy farmers on an unimaginable scale     but henderson isnt alone in his endeavours to stir the pot hail incredibly tesco supplier roddy catto who is a founder member of the muller wiseman milk group and until very recently its former chairman and yes you read it right hes a tesco supplier supplying no milk whatsover to morrisons   he went on local television wearing his scottish nfu hat commenting on the morrisons offer in the interview catto states the scheme is a shambles and how would i be able to calculate how much extra money im going to get from morrisons  that is an easy calculation its zero consequently he should not have been commenting on a morrisons initiative   for the full interview click on            httpnewsstvtvnorthmorrisonsmoreexpensivemilkforfarmersrangeashambles   next and not to be left out of the murk comes dairy farmer stuart heath from staffordshire who is one of muller wisemans farmers who sits on the tesco sustainable dairy group committee and again supplies tesco not morrisons he also was on national tv commenting on the morrisons initiative and was also less than complimentary about it for the full interview click on      httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwsceybrrqcfeatureyoutubea   questions are flying around as to why only a day or two before the cma announce their decision on the takeover of dairy crests liquid business by muller that two high ranking tescomuller wiseman farmers end up on tv commenting in a hugely negative way on the morrisons initiative quite what tesco say about the ethics of two of their farmers commenting so publically and critically on a rival is one that ian intends to find out   in addition since the announcement on the th november  that muller wiseman intended to buy dairy crests liquid business which has been ratified by the cma today  google cma accepts remedy in dairy merger the deal has had a clean run journalists media industry organisations and competitor processors have been careful not to jump in with their size nines and yet within hours of the deadline for the announcement by the cma we have these antics one of the videos could be put down to naivety two of them are definitely questionable two plus the trading standards referral certainly dont look as if they are accidental   its murky stuff not befitting the

november th the first full month will be pp based on september milk sales and paid on th december  the reason for the delay in dc paying out the first support payment is cash flow based and revolves around the payment terms lidl and morrisons work to  in a nutshell dc have no reason to bank roll or bridge the gap  the flip side is that the payments to producers will continue around two months after the deadline date   clearly once the sale of dairy crests liquid division is approved different arrangements concerning these payments by muller may be adopted however they are sure to be

milk price crisis both in the select committee context but also doing his own research   he has come up with a tenpoint plan for the industry  a series of practical proposals some short term some mid to longterm   we thought his plan worthy of circulation email any comments to malcolmrishisunakcom   ten steps to help save british dairying   last week i spoke to an yearold farmer in my constituency who told me that in a lifetime of dairy farming he had never seen times as so bad with farm gate milk prices falling  per cent in a year  in many cases below the cost of production  its far from an exaggeration   i have spent the last few weeks speaking to dairy farmers industry experts and government ministers about the terrible difficulties the industry is facing its clear nobody can wave a magic wand and resolve a situation ultimately caused by a global glut of milk but i believe there are ten key steps that can and must be taken if we are to protect this most valuable element of our rural community    more retailers giving farmers a fair deal many supermarkets have worked hard through a time of rockbottom global milk prices to ensure that british farmers receive a sustainable price that said more can be done and it is absolutely vital every major retailer pays a fair price for british dairy produce you can see how your supermarket treats its famers by checking the national farmers union website  if youre not happy vote with your wallet    an end to milk being used a permanent loss leader all of us have seen the price of milk plummet in recent years with many supermarkets now charging only ł for four pints this kind of pricing can have widely detrimental effects thats because low prices in supermarkets force down prices all across the market forcing your corner shop to cut its milk price in order to compete in turn putting pressure on milk producers milk is a quality product and pricing should reflect that    better labelling of british produce it might seem like there is little that could be more english than a slice of cheddar but what many consumers dont know is that many of the major cheddar brands on the shelves are produced in europe we need to have clearer packaging that empowers consumers to buy british     more domestic production of dairy products its a scandal that two thirds of our cheese and  per cent of our butter is imported from overseas we need to invest more in processing technology to make sure we are adding value to british milk by turning more of it into british butter yogurt and cheese rather than importing so much    more supply chain transparency and enforcement we know how much a farmer gets paid for a pint of milk and we know how much we pay for it in the shops what we dont know is how big the margins are inbetween we need to work towards the kind of transparency that allows us to follow milk from farmer to shelf in order to ensure a fair price is being paid at every stage good supply chain practices then need to be enforced by a tough grocery code adjudicator and strong code of practice    more dairy producer organisations groups of farmers banding together to negotiate a better sale price for milk and a lower purchase price for feed and machinery are commonplace across europe particularly in the successful german market in the uk we currently have only one such producer organisation if farmers are going to balance out the power of big processors and retailers that needs to change    government must buy british national government is working hard to purchase british dairy products but more can be done at a regional level we must push local government hospitals schools and military establishments to do more     a working dairy futures market futures are a way for farmers to agree a prearranged price for milk they will produce in the future the price stability this can give has the potential to be invaluable to the volatile dairy industry we need the uk to follow in the footsteps of the usa and new zealand in making a working dairy futures market available    review of levy board spending every dairy farmer in the uk currently pays a percentage of their income to a government run levy board many farmers feel that more of that money needs to be spent promoting the benefits of milk and encouraging consumers to choose british it is vital that farmers feel like their levy money is being spent in a way that actually helps them    immediate financial assistance the eu has announced a m crisis fund to support vulnerable dairy farmers and we must get our fair share also it is important that regular cap payments to farmers should be made as quickly as possible to ease cash flow problems lastly hmrc and banks must understand the inherent volatility in farming incomes and be flexible in how they treat farmers    comment from rishi    nd october  without its dairy farmers yorkshires magical landscape would soon see its lush fields turn to scrub and its drystonewalls go unrepaired meanwhile with britain already only  per cent selfsufficient in food our countrys ability to feed itself in a time of crisis would be diminished only by working together can we preserve our dairy industry and with it our beautiful countryside for generations to come   spotted on a london underground billboard   nd october      as was stated by the eagleeyed

be permanent   th september  according to a report from this weeks idf conference in lithuania a speaker from the russian dairy publication has stated that the ban on the importation of european

             to average    the lift comes on the back of  and  increases and is partly due to a further  tonnes cut in the volume fonterra will offer for sale in the next three months and a total  month volume cut amounting to  tonnes at this weeks auction the amount of wmp on offer was  less than two weeks ago and  less than the corresponding auction a year ago   during the last three auctions the average all products sold price is up  with wmp up a staggering  and smp up  farmers will no doubt be cautiously optimistic that prices have bottomed out but note these headline increases come from record low averages are we not out of the wood yet but analysts are now claiming we are past the bottom   from the new zealand farmers point the fact wmp prices have passed the  tonne mark is significant because this is the level required to maintain the current seasons farm gate milk price forecast   ampe hits its lowest point to date    th september  august ampe has dropped to only p which represents a  year low since it was invented by barry wilsondin ampe now weighs in at p above impe ppl note the european commission last week declined to raise the intervention price of smp which was viewed as a way the commission could have helped stabilise the market source din   intervention smp continues to increase      th september  close to  tonnes of smp are now in intervention including  tonnes from the uk and  tonnes from southern ireland   irish cheese advert says up yours to clear labelling      th september  everyone in the uk dairy industry is aware that tensions are mounting over country of origin labelling on cheese with retailers displaying multi origin milk    the irish dairy board appear to be waving two fingers to all involved having launched an advert with a pilgrims choice label stating improve the sales of your cheddar category in two easy steps        take the pilgrims choice label      stick it onto any other cheddar pack   this sort of promotion seen in the grocer has to be challenged and remember the annual milk equivalent we import from southern ireland in cheese is a staggering  billion litres displace this and you make significant headway with the present demand problem we must push for clean origin of milk labelling on cheese and back our own red tractor   commissions dairy support package comes under attack and could involve milk quota  th september  last weeks news that eu dairy farmers are to receive the most significant chunk of a  million support package was lambasted by the european milk board who are demanding politicians intervene to reduce the production of milk in the eu and described the package as very disappointing  stating that  dairy farmers did not take to the streets for this   the fact is little of this money will filter down to uk farmers in addition its yet to be decided how to distribute the money with milk quota held at st march  an option under consideration because it would be simple to administrate   so far as the uk is concerned the figure of ł million is equivalent to ppl on all our production so for a  million litre producer it will be worth ł its not a lot but better than nothing   fonterra farmers rush for interest free support loans    th september  over  new zealand dairy farmers signed up to fonterras offer of interest free loans to help them through these

september  gdt prices rose another  at last weeks auction to average tonne us   this follows hot on the heels of the  rise only two weeks earlier   a contributory factor is the fact fonterra have seriously reduced the volume of product on offer down  compared to that offered at the same auction a year ago  milk production world wide is still ahead of demand and in new zealand production is still rising due to the fact farmers are ramping up production in an attempt to receive the same value into their banks each month irish milk production is still rocketing up with july output up  year on year until global milk production falls a full recovery seems impossible   however the latest auction results were as anticipated by a number of leading analysts following positive uplift signals in both futures and eu trading prices  dairy futures prices across the globe appear to be heading north eg  us todaytonne with    us   key movers were   butter milk powder                   to

the fact is two swallows still dont make a summer and the road to recovery is set to be a long haul with plenty of in store product still to be cleared   ffa  nfu partnership works with tesco    th september  david handley  michael oakes are to be congratulated for their joint achievements in negotiations with tesco in connection with tescos latest cheese announcement   tesco have agreed to extend its pricing model to include milk which goes into tesco own label cheese sourced from both first milk and south caernarfon creameries by paying ppl for the milk on the basis the additional money feeds back to the farmers  this will run from st august  to th february  the money will be paid by tesco to adams foods who will pay the respective coops its still unclear whether all coop members will enjoy the benefit of the extra money or whether it will be divided up amongst a select group   the move compliments the existing tsdg cheese model set up two years ago between tesco and parkham farms   so far as tesco is concerned the next issue to tackle is multicountry of origin milk labelling in own brand cheese   the promise from tesco is to be more transparent from january  with its cheese labelling however this correction is required now and not only from tesco by default this latest move points to the near certainty the tsdg liquid cop milk price will be at a similar level of ppl for next winter which will be a relief to some   muller wiseman mw declare transparency in paying the extra money  th september  muller wiseman are separately identifying the additional money pledged and paid by retail customers following recent protests and negotiations   the extra money will be ring fenced and shown as a supplementary payment and will be paid monthly based on actual sales commencing week th august  when a string of deals and pledges were announced   for august the supplementary payment will amount to ppl and had it been paid for the whole month with similar levels of sales the equivalent supplementary payment would have been circa ppl   the money will be paid to muller wiseman  nonaligned who on average will produce around  to  million litres annually   what does this mean for the piggy back milk purchasers   th september  a number of milk purchasers and formulas utilise the muller wiseman nonaligned price in their basket of prices  there will certainly be some moaning and wriggling from both processors and their producer representatives when they realise the extra money from retailers will not be added to the muller wiseman standard litre price   will some of their socalled representative negotiators seek to change the basket andor the formulas   thats for them to sort out but for sure it will mean that for  or so muller wiseman nonaligned producers they have transparency  in addition it will greatly assist muller wiseman in demonstrating an audit trial to confirm farmers have received all of the extra money paid by its retail customers   cheap milk   th september  coop chester  pints for ł   cheap cheese   th september  the coop continued to promote irish cheese with pilgrims choice extra mature cheddar at half

august  this is on the back of the continual strengthening for organic dairy products   aldi to pay at least ppl  from th august  st august    lidl to pay at least ppl  from th august  st august    morrisons to pay ppl minimum for all its liquid milk  from the end of august  st august  this is ppl less than asda aldi  lidl have agreed to pay now we are starting to understand why several have commented that morrisions are extremely difficult to deal with as customers or words to that effect their smart and skin flint moves are sure to put them back on ffas radar if indeed they were ever off it note according to the grocer the steepest retailer liquid milk price reductions have come from morrisons who have wiped  off their retail price of milk in the past five years source kantar world panel in addition the grocer reports that tesco hold the record for the steepest price reduction in butter at    morrisons farmers brand now extended to cheddar    st august  the morrisons milk for farmers brand will be extended to its own label cheddar with a p per pack premium equivalent to an extra ppl going to farmers it might be what some of our organisations wanted but its a gimmick   gdt auction price     st august  this weeks average auction index price rise of almost   was a shock and even more surprising was the  rise in the wmp average   prior to this weeks gdt result there were clear signs that prices had lifted with futures contract prices for september wmp lifting from us  to us  tonne with plenty of trading and market activity   the auction results were helped by the fact fonterra cut the amount on offer to only  tonnes of wmp at this weeks auction a  reduction on the scheduled  tonnes in addition from september until the end of january the volume of wmp to be offered in the auction has been reduced by    key prices were wmp up  to average us  tonne butter up  to average us  tonne smp up  to average us  tonne cheddar up  to average us ł tonne   next gdt auction will be september st   the fundamentals remain the same and it will take time before anyone starts to talk about a wholesale recovery at best you can be cautiously optimistic but we certainly arent out of the wood yet but these results are a welcome sign for prices to perhaps hold for a while   asda is the first retailer to be authorised to use the arla marque    st august  asda has ticked all the boxes to enable the retail giant to use the new arla marque on its own label milk together with its own label british cheddar which uses  british arla milk the spotlight should now turn to others who are less british especially in their cheese sourcing see below   iceland are back on the radar  part   st august  icelands farm vale mild white cheddar states on the packet thats its produced from milk originated from the uk  ireland another pack of cheese with multi origin milk to confuse consumers   iceland part      st august  the one retailer which has managed to keep off the radar during recent protests and activities is iceland back in late  ffa were heavily involved in negotiations with iceland and at the time a spokesman stated that with regards to ffa it would be happy to open our books to any independent adjudicator that may be appointed by the government in the future iceland declared that the price it pays for milk would be directly linked to the farmgate price received by dairy farmers in future perhaps its time ffa and others revisited this declaration to see where iceland currently sit which is hopefully somewhere between the ppl pledge of morrisons and ppl paid by m  s and waitrose   uk smp goes into intervention   st august  a uk processor rumoured to be town of monaghan from their leckpatrick plant in northern ireland has placed  tonnes of smp intervention which represents  of the total intervention stocks of  tonnes the milk price equivalent of this is around ppl   danish discount retailer rema  increases the price it pays arla for milk   st august  in a move which mirrors those made last week by retailers operating in the uk rema has increased the price it pays arla for its liquid milk by  danish ore approximately ppl with a view to the additional money supporting circa  arla members   it must be seen as a longterm initiative i am well aware that price increases are not in the curriculum of the grocery book for discount chains but danish agriculture has been put under financial pressure from the declining prices if we do not take this seriously we risk squeezing dairy farmers out of business if that happens consumers will run the risk of not being able to buy danish milk in the future and we dont want that to happen in rema  we have always only had danish milk on the shelves and we would like to continue having that says anders jensen purchasing director of rema    surely its time for a back british dairy products campaign   st august  from the very recent research we have done its clear there is groundswell support for a back british campaign particularly on cheese current own label retailer cheese labelling is a disgrace and whats needed is to highlight how several retailers are mixing irish new zealand and uk milk to confuse consumers with multi origin cheese  the only way to persuade these retailers to source  british cheese using british milk is if consumers vote with their feet the opportunity is here today and whats needed is transparent honest labelling in an attempt to displace more than  billion litres milk equivalent of irish cheese we currently import oh and whilst we are having a campaign lets get the government and food service to back british cheese they are both huge users of cheese and both use irish andor multi origin cheese   we dont need the clap trap excuses as to why we cant address our own market failure as have recently been aired we need people with a can do mentality because this momentum is gathering pace and its going to be a slow road to recovery and this must surely by self help there is still some work to do on liquid but the elephant in the room is now cheese and we need to look at a professional marketing agency run campaign funded by either the existing milk levy or new sources   snaptag   st august  please contact lydia on   or email her on lydiaipaquotascouk for more information on the snaptag cattle and sheep ear tags

this takes effect from st september and widens the gap between the formula standard litre price  ppl and dairy crests standard liquid price of ppl to ppl   arla launch the equivalent of the arla fair trade marque  th august    arla have launched a farmer owned marque which from autumn will feature on all arla branded uk products   this is certainly not a silver bullet to solve the current dire situation in the industry but it will be heavily promoted with the aim of emphasising that the milk which goes into the products is responsibly sourced from its farmer owners who retain any profits in addition the marque will confirm that the milk is produced to the highest expectations in terms of the environment and animal welfare   arla will include the logomarque on all its branded products and should find it easy to win the support of major retail customers like morrisons asda lidl and aldi presumably allowing them to use the marque on own label dairy products processed by arla subject to jumping through hoops one of which farmers will hope relates to fair pricing by the retailers involved on reflection perhaps using the word easy in conjunction with british retailers is naďve    morrisons could do with some positive pr and compliance with the marques terms of use and permission to utilise it would at least be a step in the right direction and signal that the retailer supports the arla farmers   once one retailer supports the marque on own label others will be exposed it wont be universally popular and will have its critics but its a small smart positive step of encouragement and sends a clear message to consumers as to what they are buying  supporting   in reality its similar to a fair trade mark and can only do good   morrisons ppl gimmick is possibly the best stunt ian has seen   th august  full marks to morrisons who in the space of hours temporarily changed their position from the dairy industrys villains and number  protesting target to become almost heroes   on tuesday morrisons emerged from meetings with industry leaders to announce a new milk brand called morrisons milk for farmers with a whopping ppl of the retail price going directly to its major supplier arla   i guess leaders could hardly criticise morrisons move having banged home to them that the majority of consumers are willing to pay more for milk if the extra money goes direct to farmers  if thats correct morrisons have obliged and put the nfus theory to the test    morrisons certainly pulled a rabbit out of the hat with this new brand  in ians opinion its a stunt a gimmick and it will cost morrisons nothing   in reality its doubtful whether it will succeed following its autumn launch  at the launch it is anticipated morrisons may well oblige the nfu president meurig raymonds request to   make sure there is plenty of resources available to promote this product  it must also be displayed prominently in store   so lets assume it happens and retailers continue with their obsession to offer the cheapest milk as a loss leader and are still selling  pints for p  the morrisons milk for farmers will then sit along side the p milk at ł for  pints   the extra ppl will go to arla as morrisons dominant supplier but because arla are a cooperative the money is not ringfenced to gb but in the pot to benefit  members see below for latest nfu gaff on this point   ian hopes it works and that all the farmers benefit but somehow history tells him its doomed to fail and could even experience a backlash before it is launched if morrisons are serious about helping they should cut the gimmicks and try to adopt the arla marque on all dairy products see below reference cheese   once its on the shelves we will soon learn whether consumers are willing to pay an extra ppl but its a massive  uplift   only time will tell whether the morrisons move will be sufficient to satisfy those who were protesting at morrisons premises a week ago   what next   th august  if i were asda lidl  aldi i would be banging on the nfus door offering my own variation on the farmers milk brand and agreeing to pay ppl or more direct to the farmers in the hope it buys more time and ensures protesting farmers stay away  if thats considered part of the solution all retailers should be pushed to do it   contrast morrisons to the pledge retailer booths have made   th august  northwest retailer booths have  stores and have pledged to pay the very best price for liquid milk to its farmers under their fair milk scheme  currently they pay their farmers ppl  now thats worthy of real publicity and is certainly fair trade   nfu gaff in announcing asda commit to pay ppl for  of its liquid milk   th august  according to an nfu press release asda have delivered what is undoubtedly a significant improvement in the farmgate milk price it pays arla for all of its liquid milk from next monday th to ppl however interestingly in the official asda press release which came out after the nfus there is no mention of the p and no mention of the money going to british farmers in its press release the nfu state that the p will then be expected to pass this onto its british farmer suppliers no way nfu because to do this would necessitate a complete re write of the arla coop principles which  dairy farmers have signed up to this would spark a dairy war   in addition its a dangerous road to even consider because it could be met with thankyou cards from the danes  swedes to the nfu think about it the danes could say if thats the game we will retain all the money from lurpack butter in denmark   surely the nfu as a farmer organisation understand how a successful coop works and arla are certainly not going to rewrite their constitution and rules to re nationalise its milk pricing   nfu president meurig raymond commented it is now important that arla ensures this is delivered to british farmers on the ground with immediate effect oh dear perhaps more thought and less haste from nfu communications department is required because this is pants   however the move by asda is seismic and on the issue of cheese it is already well ahead of tesco and morrisons for its red tractor support   milk is now ppl cheaper than bottled water   th august  that was the strap line in last weeks grocer  the research requires no further commentary

british and northern irish produce and french farmer demonstrations are heading towards closing down their markets to foreign imports despite the eu market principles if british consumers and food

for either freshways or medina for up to  years these two processors are considered by the cma to be effective competitors to muller however it must be noted that medina already trade large quantities

are almost certain to fall further   how big is the uks milk problem   th august  mullers bean counters have been doing some interesting number crunching  the extra  billion litres of milk we have

antagonist statements  a copy of the letter is in ffas inbox   morrisons  number  target of protesting dairy farmers   th august  for obvious reasons protesting dairy farmers have this week focussed their efforts on morrisons asda lidl  aldi   rather than seeking to sit round the table with leaders of the protesting farmers morrisons decided to issue an ill thought out antagonistic letter to the protesters which was interpreted as morrisons stamping their authority as to who is really in charge and sticking two fingers up at dairy farmers   the letter refers to potential personal liability we reserve the right to commence court proceedings injunction reserve the right to commence trespass actions against you personally personally liable for the financial consequences of these protests and the court proceedings which follow   and in bold print we have and are arranging for further evidence to be gathered about your identity   we may use cctv footage take photographs of individuals or vehicles present   the letter closes yours faithfully but with no individuals name attached however the name darren blackhurst morrisons group commercial director is one name on farmers radars even though he has been on annual leave this week  he is extesco and bq and nicknamed captain chaos on account of his reputation for firing first then thinking about what he has done later  note the original captain chaos was diagnosed with a multiple personality disorder   david handleys response on the ffa news page summed it up all we want is a fair price a living wage and be able to make a profit from our business   handley has also stated publically that ffa would prefer to meet face to face with retailers  in the case of morrisons if they are serious they need to wheel out dave potts their ceo and not send stand in substitutes who have little or no power to change anything   note when radio  farming today attempted to arrange to speak to a representative of

the family dairy from stirling scotland wrote a letter on the th july to the firms  or so family dairies which in one fell swoop savaged the incomes of around  farms                        grahams were one of the first uk processors to introduce ab pricing and grabbed the headlines last week by being the first to impose a b price of between  to ppl estimated for august and will soon be closer to  than ppl for unwanted surplus litres                           in the letter robert graham states to this end we must reduce the price paid on the ingredient litres aka the b litres to  of ampe in addition there was a ppl cut to the firms a price which probably cant be argued with given the state of the market and is still a healthy liquid standard litre price   under the grahams formula for august producers will receive ppl on the a litres based on  of a farms st september  to th august  production and the b litre price will be paid on the rest this will affect at least  of the  or so grahams producers and will reduce their income by an estimated ł each month or equivalent to ł per farm per month for those affected                                                               the nfus believe that grahams will be the only gb milk buyer paying ppl or less for any of their milk   emails to ian show the main bone of contention is that producers spent time providing the company with   production forecasts which they believe have proved to be accurate if that is true then they believe grahams should have anticipated the milk they have received and managed their pool better but according to robert graham some of the  b milk producers are  to almost  above their  allocation   in addition during  grahams have supposedly had new producers start to supply them and others are in the pipeline and due to start to supply soon however ian has verified that the agreement to take on four farmers goes back a year or more so while this is unpalatable it is not untoward and is a case of grahams honouring their commitment and not dumping anyone   farmers believe that as part of the grahams family the b price move warranted a producer meeting to discuss the issues and agree a way forward rather than receive the bombshell letter with hindsight the indication is that grahams agree they could have handled the situation better their letter came out of the blue and rocked the industry and resulted in serious heartache on the farms affected   however whilst a producer meeting to transparently explain the problem would have been preferable the outcome would not have been different basically grahams producers are sending the company in excess of  million litres of milk each month which the firm are having to sell into a very weak spot market mainly in england  wales for underppl delivered at present and weakening   one producer commented i remember your fathers words when i joined grahams we are only looking for young ambitious men who want to expand their businesses in a similar way to us   he agreed its those same ambitious farmers who have been hit hard with this short notice price b price annihilation so grahams have created a pr problem and next month they have a planning meeting for a new dairy where they may need some friends in high places   on further examination the basic problem is grahams have   million litres surplus more milk each month than they have customers for options available to them were as follows   a     give notice to some producers that is harsh and takes months to affect total milk intake and how are they selected presumably starting with those who produce the highest percentage of b litres   b     cut the a price by more but that penalises the  who have not expanded and kept within the limits and appears unfair   c     reduce the a volume from  to say  or   that penalises the wrong farmers ie those who have not expanded   d     do nothing and dig a financial black hole not an option   e     penalise the farmers who are producing the extra milk by halving the b price   its harsh for those who have expanded believing they could spread their fixed costs receiving the ampe price on their b litres at ppl june price  note the grahams b price is transparent and takes ampe less ppl haulage less  processer margin and from august st less   this price is independently calculated by stephen bradley wwwmilkpricescom  so it might be a low price but it is still very transparent   whilst there is no volume limit for grahams farmers the move has instantly affected production with one producer switching from x to x day milking   the dilemma faced by grahams is unfortunately not unique and partly attributable to aggressive retail discounting of milk together with one or more predating processors attempting to undercut the existing liquid supplier in some cases its a case of either cut the price you charge us for the milk or risk loosing some volume   spotted on the grahams family

option    th july  tesco aligned producers have been put on notice that tesco have started an in depth comprehensive review of the tesco sustainable dairy group tsdg which has run for close to  years   the review will cover everything and some of the key phrases from the letter for farmers to focus on are as follows        the letter is from tescos commercial director of fresh food  commodities and not from the tesco dairy agriculture manager         allows us to adapt the tsdg to the industry changes we have seen and make it sustainable into the future this means sustainable for tesco as well as the farmers          fairness  we want to pay a fair price for our milk and reward farmers who are driving performance efficiency and standards this means the current model is almost certain to change by the next price review date of november st         of you told us tesco that you have benefitted from being a member of tsdg  its a pity the other  didnt top it up to           we want you the supplying farmers to be part of this process  your views and opinions really matter to us   whilst tesco will listen to producers opinions i suggest you forget it if your opinion is simply stating we need the money  all tesco core farmers will have to get involved in this review or face the consequences if they simply leave it to their respective processors committee members and then scream when the outcome is not to their satisfaction    i asked one tesco committee member how many times he had been thanked for his efforts and he said once with dozens of criticisms  comments welcome but for tesco suppliers its time to be on the pitch in attack and defence not on the side lines chanting and hurling abuse   defending the status quo is in my opinion indefensible and not an option  there will be change and its best done by negotiation and consent   the outlook for  is grim   th july  regrettably both the eu and world dairy outlook for the second half of  is nothing short of very grim there are even signs that some european processors are on the brink of supplying product into intervention which now seems to be inevitable by august at the latest   next wednesday will be the next fortnightly gdt auction and already analysts are anticipating another  fall in the key product auction price of wmp with more falls expected in august as the quantity of

readers please confirm who processes and packs eden milk   grim gdt auction results with wmp down    rd july  wednesdays gdt auction results were grim with the all products average down  with the biggest hit coming in the form of a brutal  drop in wmp prices leaving them only just above  us a tonne averaging    this hurts because both in new zealand and globally the wmp price is a huge influencer in determining farm gate milk prices  such low prices were last seen  years ago in july    note in exactly  months the auction value of smp has more than halved to what it was in july  when prices started to tumble big time and its not ended yet   note the volume on offer at this weeks auction was more than  up on the volume put forward only two weeks ago with  tonnes forward   there is only one question everyone is asking   how long will global dairy prices continue to drop before they bottom out   despite the continued downward spiral the eus agriculture commissioner phil hogan

signed up  of their  supplying members to their dpo dairy producer organisation   a key feature of the dpo status is it will ensure future contractual term variations and price changes will be by negotiation and not at dairy crests discretion   the wonder is why only  have signed up and not  unless the remaining  who havent signed are planning to exit the industry  on that score if only  hang the clusters up in the next  months that could be a fantastic result   ppl milk price reduction for first milk  a price milk  from st july  th june  the reduction is across the board with the

ppl mainland scotland ppl north of england ppl haverfordwest  ppl lake district ppl   after deduction of the ppl capital retention plus the  mix of a and b prices means at least an estimated ppl will

between ppl and ppl   note first milks forecast july b milk price is between ppl to ppl however its a certainty if will be closer to ppl than ppl   finally in making the announcement with only a weeks notice of the price change to members first milk has on this occasion abandoned the voluntary code of practice   i dont think anyone will criticise them for that move on two counts   one is why should they subscribe to the code when it comes to price changes when others clearly dont   secondly they have to do what they have to do to ensure they stop the barmy practice of paying members more money for milk then they can obtain from the market place simple   ppl milk price reduction for arla amba members  from th july   th june  this is made up of a  euro cent across the board price

milk production is estimated as recorded and more seriously it equates to the need to increase exports by a whopping  in order to shift the additional product from this extra milk   individual countries positions are as follows   southern ireland production in april  italy production in april   holland production in may   poland production in april   in the case of the usa production for

the need for commercial and business skills on the board of first milk sir jim has announced he is to stand down as soon as a replacement is agreed   two or three points spring to mind connected to this announcement firstly he is sure to shortly be followed by others who will step down from the board of first milk as it regroups to execute gallachers turnaround plan   second there was minimal if indeed any recognition in the nfus press releasenfu reaction bulletin in terms of normal protocol which many had expected would have included a line suggesting sir jim had done a good job not a word along these lines from either the president of the nfu or its dairy board chairman both of whom were quoted the situation was even worse in the scottish nfus press release of the same date   new chairman of muller wiseman milk group board   th june  philip rowney takes over as chairman of the group from roddy catto and in doing so represents  dairy farmers who supply mw   the press release paid tribute and thanks to the work of the outgoing chairman   roddy deserves enormous credit for the hard work commitment and energy he has shown as chairman of the mwmg board   more than half of uk consumers are willing to pay more for milk  according to mintel   th june  one of the leading market intelligence research companies mintel have found that over  of consumers surveyed would be willing to pay more than ł for  pints of milk   so as retailers battle to sell the lowest price milk at p or less for  pints in a bid to get customers through the door mintel is asking the key question   whether that level of price cutting is needed   first milk announce eyewatering losses of łm  th june    first milk have informed members that its losses for the financial year ended march  will be around łm equal to łday or nearly łmmonth at least that has got the bad news out early tesco style but the big question for its members will surley be by how much have these loses slowed down in april and may of  and in what month do they budget to breakeven   first milk have consistently paid one of the lowest if not the lowest exfarm gate milk prices yet still they paid out more than they could afford to pay and have consequently returned to members for money to bridge the gap   several first milk members who emailed ian today seem to have come to the conclusion that all the blame sticks with the former ceo kate allum that may be a convenient place to hide but its unlikely to be the whole story   the first milk board have to accept responsibility for the part they have played in achieving these appauling results because they have a clear remit and it appears they have failed   in todays letter to members chairman sir jim paice has commented personally i believe a business of this size needs a board with substantial commercial experience apologies to all involved at first milk but translating this means very few farmers will sit on the main board of first milk   on that statement ian feels sir jim is bang on but first milk is a business which is currently shrinking or at best holding its own in dirty water and it needs that commercial expertise asap ian is not sure whether those on the board at the moment know they have to leave but for those who do realise they might be wise to move on prior to completion of the review   the review of its governance cannot come soon enough because if gallacher is to stand any chance of succeeding with his turnaround policy he needs more professionals on his board and not with respect enthusiastic amateurs who have played their part in todays financial announcement but at the end of the day its up to the members to influence who is in and out of the board and to express any dissatisfaction   one of the options open to muller is discounted  th june    earlier this week ian suggested one of the options open to muller was to withdraw its łm offer to buy dairy crests liquid business and walk away   ian is reliably informed that the deal was signed by both parties and will be concluded subject to competition authority cma approval   that means there are only two options available to muller with one a near certainty namely that the deal is subject to an in depth scrutiny from the cma under phase   quite why phase  has to take  months conclude to leaving  plus employees in limbo is beyond comprehension but i guess the cma simply have rules procedures  timelines   however for the retailers or others who have already thrown spanners in the works with the cma its time to produce the objections and evidence   its put up or shut up time because if i were muller i would be seeking to settle for nothing less than unconditional approval   shore capital suggested the complainant retailer could be asda which is surely the least likely  lets face it asda source all their gb liquid milk from one sole supplier arla and dont appear to experience any regional problems  they surely have no grounds to raise any issues with the cma   european and world view   th june  the general view is that gdt auction prices are unlikely to have stabilised or bottomed out this week  most if not all respected analysts are now of the opinion that it will be at least  months before we see signs of any substantial price increases   uk eu and world milk production is still increasing and this is not matched by increased demand   in the case of the uk may production is estimated by dairyco to be  at  billion litres compared to that recorded in  and is record   whilst the average decline at this weeks gdt was small it has to be balanced with the fact the volume of available product amounted to only  tonnes and in two weeks time the tonnage will increase by  to  tonnes  that will be a real test for the market   note the arla westbury smp sold at this weeks gdt actually sold for  of the current eu intervention price so it cannot really fall any lower   new chairman at belton cheese    th june  william neville former senior partner at solicitors burges salmon and the man considered the uk dairy industries legal guru and rottweiler is the new nonexecutive chairman at

compared to the average achieved two weeks ago   the positives other than the fact the fall was smaller than recorded in recent months was the fact many key products were either close to a stand on price or saw their average price improve   also the number of registered bidders continues to increase and today totalled  compared to  at the last auction and similarly the number of winning bidders increased from  to  which is encouraging   key movers of interest cheddar                    to average           tonne butter                                  to average            tonne wmp

bottled it  mullerwiseman merger goes to phase    th june  this was a very appropriate headline from shore capitals dairy analyst clive black as he reported on the competition  markets authority cma press release which was bizarrely issued at  hours last friday   the ł million bid by muller to acquire the liquid business of dairy crest will now move to an in depth investigation under phase  unless acceptable undertakings are offered by muller to the cma by this friday th   throughout the press release there is no acknowledgement from the cma that this deal simply has to take place because no business can continue to lose circa ł million a year as dairy crest did last year in its liquid division   instead its obvious from the press release that one or more of our big retailers has objected to the deal on the grounds that there will be a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of fresh milk to major grocery retailers with national scope national multiples in certain regions in great britain commented the cma in their press release   in ians opinion this points to one region with up to two national retailers who are the most likely to have objected   the region is most likely to be the south west and the short odds are on a complaint from sainsburys followed possibly by morrisons   the cma has confirmed to ian that the identity of objectors in phase  andor the substance of their objection will not be publically disclosed   in its press release the cma goes on to state  the cma considers that the merger may lead to higher prices in the supply of fresh milk to national multiples and in turn for consumers   clive black accurately comments that no one seriously believes that the big four supermarkets will charge more to customers for milk in plymouth swansea and taunton that the rest of the country  using an old fashioned milk industry term therefore has the cma bottled it   he is spot on they have bottled it and completely ignored the farmer impact of the deal and have hidden behind one or more of our big  retailers  wimps   speculation over what the muller team might do next   th june  as ian sees it muller have three options        they could simply say lets go to phase  and let it run its  month course to xmas  they can do this in the full knowledge that the deal is almost certain to be approved at the end of phase         assuming the south west is the region in question muller could offer to sell its bridgwater liquid factory  there must be more chance of ian becoming an olympic synchronised swimming gold medallist than that happening  thats a scary thought          muller say to hell with it we dont need the aggro  we will immediately withdraw the offer and let dairy crests liquid business bleed to death   option  looks tempting to ian followed by option  however given the deal is right for both parties and right for the uk dairy industry i suspect muller will be determined that option  is the right avenue to pursue   arla tesco farmers are ppl apart but for how much longer   th june  the difference in the milk price received by arla amco coop members on a tesco aligned contract and the arla tesco directs is almost ppl and must surely be at its widest point   by st november tesco are sure to reduce the price by at least the change in the cost of production if not more which will narrow the gap by a sizeable percentage   as part of a costings review arla have examined the ppl livestock code of practice enhancement paid to arla amco members who supply tesco and the result is the true cost is ppl  note this premium is not paid to the arla tesco directs   from st july the premium paid will increase from ppl to ppl  in addition a back payment of ppl to cover the top up from st january  to th june  will be paid to all arla amco tesco suppliers who are members at st december    there will be some who question why there is a delay in paying the top up payment  we can only come up with one real reason and that is the delay is an attempt to persuade any arla amco tesco farmers contemplating serving  months notice to become arla tesco direct suppliers to not make that move   in addition by the time the ppl is paid the gap and the situation is likely to have changed which coupled with the ppl top up is likely to influence some amco members   arla

banning milk from coming from the two badger cull areas its fair to say that farmers are seething about this and so too was i note the word was the past tense thats until i had spoken to nero at length and indepth and thought a bit more about what it has done my views will be diametrically opposed to most farmers but theres a lynch mob out there right now some in the dairy industry refer to me as a leader   if thats the case i contest that few if any leaders would follow or condone a lynch mob i hope what i have to say now tempers some of the industrys entirely understandable vitriol against the company first yes the chain seems to have panicked in making its decision but i genuinely believe that it had received credible malicious and very nasty threats to its staff and remember many most in fact of its publicfacing staff are young and female  of its staff are aged between  and  in fact they are wholly untrained in dealing with nasty malicious people hell bent on being as unpleasant and intimidating as they can be why should they be trained in that or put in that position i have a daughter aged  and i wouldnt want her to face such a frightening scene having said that she works in the office with me and she would say thats frightening and scary  many farmers will have daughters and sons of the same or similar age to those working in nero and who are starting out in perhaps their first job i am sure they share my view some of the small shops in london have as few as two people working in them  so thats two youngish girls potentially under threat for that reason i can wholly empathise as to why nero wanted to in fact had to put their staff first on this issue i know the same applies to farmers too they should not be threatened either but that is the nature of the people we are dealing with nero were a soft target for the food terrorists who embarked on a nasty social media campaign which included sending at least one threatening email direct to one of its senior people aimed at him and his family in addition the terrorists posted up a map of the route of a planned austerity march on june th which marked every nero coffee store on it note nero have  london stores second nero has had a thorough thumping from farmers journalist and commentators but nero are not the villains or the enemy the enemy are the same bastrds that intimidate the farmers in the cull zones we are on the same side as nero as an industry we should be standing by our customers in such times not condemning them and fighting among ourselves we have to throw a protective unified arm around them and send out the message that the antis wont divide and rule us unless we do this then it will be another company next and then another one after that despite press claims to the contrary having spoken to nero on several occasions at board level i can confirm the police are heavily involved and have taken the threats very seriously nero have not actually refused to apologise to dairy farmers but they simply cant at the moment under these circumstances third every hour that passes when farmers are screaming at nero is another hour where the antis are laughing at our expense and rejoicing in all the publicity they have generated and that we continue to generate on their behalf they secured an early pr victory but we are helping to drag it out it has to stop nero doesnt have a position for or against the badger cull which they say is a matter for the government to deal with however they certainly have the utmost sympathy for dairy farmers who are caught up in this situation they do have a duty of care to protect their staff and customers from the threats of violence intimidation and business disruption with hindsight nero could certainly have handled the situation different and better but at the end of the day they simply sell coffee and from my conversations with them nero plan to continue to use british milk from british dairy farmers and have no appetite to take a position on the badger cull in my opinion the time for giving nero a thump is over it is now time to hold out the hand of cooperation and to start helping it to get back to where it was and to send a message out that the industry will help and support other customers faced with similar intimidation its nero today and you can be sure other targets will already be on the terrorists radar its time to stand united first milks chairman sir jim paices łk salary is slammed by politicians  th june  the scottish rural affairs committee enquiry singled out first milks sir jim paices salary of ł a year for  days work for some robust scrutiny   msp asked whether the payment of ł a day was fair remuneration given the difficulties faced by the farmer members of the troubled coop   sir jims response was im not going to deny that im being paid very reasonably for it but thats not the primary objective   there was also criticism of the fact the salaries of the rest of the board are shrouded under secrecy   thats surprising because if its true then clearly some of the members presumably feel the salary they receive is unjustified   one thing is for certain if the ongoing independent report into the governance of first milk is as hard hitting as it should be a number of its board will surely be replaced this year with better qualified professional members who can help the new ceo as opposed to what some have called enthusiastic members   arla uk tv campaign promotes dairy farming and ownership  th june  this monday during the coronation street

which are helping produce the clean wholesale nutritious milk i drink   as one stated we are food producers and my hands show how hard i work but to be honest i am almost ashamed of how they look

either retired or resigned who are clearly aggrieved at a recent letter they have received from chairman sir jim paice   whilst ian has not spoken to first milk or been briefed on the letter it would appear that those who are entitled to capital repayments having finished supplying milk five years earlier will have the repayment they are entitled to deferred by one year and split over three years so anyone due capital on the st march  will not receive it all until st march  if all goes to plan and for some of these producers it appears they also believe in the tooth fairy perhaps first milks new ceo is the tooth fairy or perhaps he is a magician   numerous emails are asking ians opinion whether this is legal ian suspects first milk would not be so stupid as to make such a move without having taken legal advice  however if anything to the contrary comes to light please email ian especially if any of the real legal eagles or rottweilers have any thoughts on or off the record   the basic problem is the first milk collection box is empty and both existing and former members all want to take out quicker than its going in so fingers and legs crossed for both existing and former members that the good ship first milk pays out to all involved quicker going forward    gdt auction prices were very grim and down   rd april  it was april st and many had hoped this weeks disastrous

extent and comes on the back of a similar average price fall of  only two weeks earlier and is the biggest fall in more than four years the news is grim and across the world dairy farmers realise if this trend continues in two weeks time the likelihood is that farm gate prices for most dairy farmers will be further cut and it will hurt there is no one to blame its the market yet interestingly over here in new zealand there is a lot of talk about the ending of european milk quotas and the anticipated extra production that is likely to come on stream from now on the feeling amongst buyers is

final years combined superlevy bill of between  million to  billion   the commission have given the option for farmers to pay superlevy over a three year period to assist cash flow  this allows farmers to spread levy bills and to pay in october   and   the move has triggered strong rumours in a number of countries that the affected farmers intend to use the money they had earmarked to be instantly deducted from their milk cheques as money to invest in more equipment and cows with the intention of increasing production   none of this is helping to boost eu prices because the signal to buyers across the world is that milk will be plentiful leading some analysts to doubt earlier predictions that in quarter  july st onwards world prices will recover especially with claims that chinese

recently tightened up control on the distribution and use of    the threat came in the form of blackmail letters sent to two of new zealands main infant formula processors fonterra and federated farmers in november   the threat was to contaminate baby powders unless new zealand ends its use of the  poison by the end of this month  included with the letters the criminals provided samples of baby powder which tested positive for a concentrated form of  poison   since the threat was received  product samples have tested negative for  going back to september  baby powders manufactured prior

compared to those offered at the same auction in   volumes offered have reduced by  or  tonnes during the last three months auctions december to february compared to those sold a year ago   in addition poor farmgate milk prices in new zealand have resulted in a significant reduction in production due to economics   lets hope this dramatic turn around continues because if it does the next move will be for fonterra to review its farmgate milk price payout with the intention to pay more to its farmer members   whilst the world is still awash with milk it looks like this market has well and truly turned and for those who have had raw treatment from their milk buyer in recent months be aware they could soon be wanting to cuddle up to you especially those who effectively told farmers

wound the letter went on to confirm the reduction was out with the spirit of the current agreement the fmcs lactalis approach to producers has certainly come as a surprise to producers and will no doubt have the uks independent milk pricing guru stephen bradley wwwmilkpricescom scratching his head as the person who calculates the fmc producers basket milk price which is now a complicated calculation to the detriment of the producers   if that wasnt enough they intend to introduce a change to milk pricing in less that two months by april but no details are available  all of these

chairmans evidence to be investigated   rd february  first milks vice chairman nigel evans gave evidence at last wednesdays scottish parliament dairy inquiry and the thud of msps jaws hitting the floor was deafening when he claimed that first milks member payment over the last three years compared to the payout relative to its competitor milk processors would be a lot better   the full transcript of the relevant part reads as follows        nigel evans the operative words that you just used are at the moment when we look at prices over periods of time we see a lot more commonality of pricing the truth is that because of product mix and the different markets that companies work in there will always be differentials in pricing taking as an example the skimmedmilk powder pricing that we have talked about it is trading at a price equivalent to p a litre but  months ago it was trading at a price that was nearer p a litre that kind of situation has a substantial impact on the pricing of different elements of the market graeme dey msp so if we were to look back over the past three years and analyse the price that was being paid by the private companies as set against the cooperatives price are you telling me that the cooperative would be performing better in how it responded to its members or worse nigel evans do you mean in terms of our price relative to that of our competitors graeme dey msp yes nigel evans we would be performing a lot better fortunately msp michael russell concluded by stating we should get that analysis it appears to be an outrageous claim however to prove whether the evidence by evans can be backed up by the facts requires one call or email to stephen bradley aka wwwmilkpricescom ian has already emailed the convener suggesting they immediately contact stephen for that independent analysis and make their findings public the smart money is on the facts simply proving that all that has happened is that the gap between first milk and its competitors has widened scottish parliament tackle evasive retailers head on  rd february  this week the inquiry will hear evidence from retailers and the grocer code adjudicator christine tacon tesco sainsburys lidl and marks  spencer have each received a special invitation from rob gibson msp who is the convener of the inquiry basically all four retailers declined to accept the

produce our milk should also make a living   its a very clear message from sainsburys where they firmly nail their colours to the mast in support of british dairy farmers who supply sainsburys through their dedicated liquid milk  however its still a retailer and discounter scrum on cheese where only tesco pay a premium to a large group of dedicated farmers on mature cheddar   its a pity morrisons pr machine does not operate in the same way and indeed that of some other retailers and discounters who appear to have an insatiable appetite to drive down prices to consumers processors and dairy farmers   morrisons switch milk from dairy crest to arla aylesbury rd january  whilst dairy crest have retained some of morrisons liquid milk business for the next three years the outcome of the recent tender process is that they have lost  million litres to arla  have morrisons placed  million litres of extra business at the expense of dairy crest based on price service were they drawn to the most modern state of the art liquid milk processing facility in the world  aka  aylesbury or was it because morrisons wanted to be seen to support a coop where the money is shared evenly amongst the members   at the end of the day the loss of dairy crest volume is likely to affect muller wiseman more than dc assuming the pending liquids deal is approved by our completion authorities   morrisons dedicated liquid milk supply group  rd january  the phones were red hot on wednesday with numerous media keen to get an industry response to the news that morrisons is to start recruiting farmers for its first dedicated milk pool  the story originated from farmers weekly but it appears to have either been a red herring or a complete misunderstanding   neither dairy crest direct or arla amco have had discussions with morrisons over setting up a dedicated group   things progress at snails pace with morrisons when it comes to its intentions with dairy  for example it has been running a small pilot cheese producer group with first milk in south wales since july   they gained some positive pr  months ago at the launch with claims that the retailer hopes to expand the project to supply all of its cheddar through this process should the trail prove successful  but all is eerily silent   first milks ceo grocer article seeks to reassure customers  rd january  kate allum ceo of first milk whom many believed was in public hibernation commented in an article in last weeks grocer that she was surprised by the fact we received more coverage than any other dairy industry story i can recall  we were not talking about an acquisition or the launch of a new product   no kate the media interest was because first milk do not have enough money in the bank to pay your  plus farmers their two weeks worth of milk on the th and th january and thats the position going forward  its never happened before so it shouldnt have come as a shock as to how big the story was   kate then went on to comment   this move significantly improves our cashflow which was negatively affected by falling dairy market prices throughout    this could be rewritten as follows   this move negatively affects our members cashflow at a time when they are struggling to cope with one of the worst milk prices in great britain of close to ppl  they are the hard working families who are picking up the bill for falling dairy market prices and our failure to add value to the milk cheques we have traditionally paid them on the th of each month which will now be paid on the th with the remainder on the th of the month   whilst kates commentary flags up the fact first milk customers understand the actions we have taken are positive steps most first milk members are extremely worried and are by no means convinced the move is positive so far as their short and long term bank balances are concerned  however their prayer mats are pointed towards glasgow china ireland and anywhere they see hope   lets hope the farmer meetings and next weeks first milk agm inject some confidence in members especially when the accounts are released and presented and it declares its

conference it wasnt many minutes before opening speaker nfu president myrig raymond mentioned the plight of more than  first milk producers    david handley followed up with what chairman john allen of kite described as a powerful and emotional speech on the subject of first milk handley said that first milks payment deferral move was a disgrace   during question time up popped first milk board member willie campbell and a loud clunk of press and delegates jaws could be heard when campbell declared i am proud of what we first milk have done   an unfortunate choice of words and within minutes sky news and an avalanche of media were clamouring to interview campbell and challenge him on his jaw dropping statement   below is a cartoon and report which scottish farmer produced which accurately summaries events       previously that morning bbc tv featured an on farm interview with willie campbell on its main national news   that didnt go well as viewers were drawn to campbells scruffy cap which was described as older than him and resembling the sort of cap a pantomime eddie grundy would wear  it was certainly a poor advert for a modern professional dairy farmer who is also a board member making financial decisions on behalf of  plus coop members   the decision was quickly taken that campbell was no longer suitable to present to the media and all interviews were pulled  with hindsight first milk should have had either jim paice or nigel evans present at the conference to address all questions   all in all first milk had a very bad day at the office on monday and it can only get better   first milk what next th january  first milk have two remaining member meetings taking place next week  next will arrive its overdue financial accounts for the year ended march  followed by its agm on the th january   in addition there are rumblings of a possible legal challenge by a small group of first milk nestle producers on grounds of discrimination  this could be a very hot potato to handle   there are also questions being asked by qualified accountants as to whether the coop passes the test of trading as a going concern   but whilst all of these points are bouncing about no one appears to have addressed the real question   what radical changes are first milk going to make to turn the ship around  they cant expect members to plug the holes and bridge the shortfall as they have recently with their łmillion snatch and grab because that is passing the pain to its members who are already under extreme pressure  their banks and suppliers may be sympathetic but they will be looking  yards down the road to see what dramatic business turnaround changes first milk are making  so what are first milk going to do different other than claim they need to add

january  instead of the price cut it is to increase member capital contributions from the current ppl to ppl back dated to milk supplied from st december  and forward dated to st august   months twinned with this is an increase in the member capital investment target from the current p to ppl   combining the ppl price cut reversal with the ppl capital contribution will give a net additional cost to first milk members of ppl ppl  ppl reversed cut less ppl current capital contribution   in summary  th january  this is unwelcome news for struggling first milk members and clearly the coop has an immediate cash flow crisis and to cut to the chase it cannot pay for members milk as planned  for its members they have a simple choice to stay with first milk or quit milk because finding an alternative milk purchaser and joining the  to  plus who have no milk buyer from st april is not a sensible option                              there are however some positives ian can see

didnt the business simply would have run out of cash and soon some action is much better than no action   b  whilst its a rolling  day payment deferral it could have been worse it could for instance have skipped a month and missed one milk cheque or even worse closed the doors and sunk the ship in the spring   c  some thought has certainly gone into ensuring all first milk members share the pain proportionally the ppl price cut reversal does not affect its nestle and tesco aligned producers who are immune from the cuts but by reversing the price cut by ppl and taking the extra ppl in capital contributions all pay pro rata including its nestle and tesco farmers this is surely a basic principle of how a co op works   the plan is that the combined package will put first milks finances and business into a stronger position and will inject a much needed ł million into the business   its not an easy decision to take and time will tell whether the plan works to ensure both first milks members and the company survive and prosper   lets hope these moves stabilise the business and help rebuild its cash flow   its delayed agm on the th january is likely to be well attended   gdt auction prices up   th january  its nothing to trumpet about but perhaps there could be a small glimmer of light at the end of a very long and dark world dairy tunnel  however note that the volume of product on offer was down   tonnes  so almost a  drop in the quantity on offer v only a  uplift is sobering   the average price at this weeks auction rose  compared to the results achieved three weeks earlier december th   key movers of interest were   butter              up          to average  tonne ł cheddar          up            to average  tonne ł smp                up            to average  tonne ł wmp               up            to average  tonne ł   arla westbury smp    down       to average  tonne ł   note a significant gap has opened up between arla westbury smp at łtonne and new zealand smp at łtonne  a difference of łtonne or    the reason for the difference according to one seasoned independent wise analyst is a combination of weak currency and high stocks of smp in europe  eu smp production for  to the end of october is up  hence the high stocks and weak prices   inserting the gdt average for eu butter  ł and arla smp  ł into the  ampe formula gives an ampe of ppl which does not allow for the cost of transporting the milk from farm to processing factory  taking farmgate transport costs into account will give an equivalent farmgate ampe of between  to ppl  this is based on an ex farm collection costs of between  to ppl however if the milk has to then be transhipped to westbury deduct a further ppl   inserting the new zealand gdt average for butter at a price of ł and the new zealand smp average at ł gives an ampe of ppl so world butter and smp prices are ahead of eu prices which to some extent is a positive   note eu milk production in  to the end of october is up    farmers weekly editor is new ahdb ceo   th january  jane king who left her position as editor of farmers weekly at the end of last year is to head up the ahdb   so with a new chairman and new ceo a few more changes and surgery the industry could soon see a more ambitious and courageous ahdb and its sector boards and oh how that is long overdue   new chairman peter kendall commented to the farmers guardian   her communication skills and experience of both repositioning and leading a wellknown agricultural service brand through a period of change  means she will be able to lead ahdb through an important period as it works towards becoming a centre of excellence for the uk industry   as one communications top cat commented to ian via email in appointing jane ahdb are sending a clear message that they want to communicate better   with jane at the helm they are likely to get there and she will be very alert to the fact she will have to crack some eggs to make her communication omelettes   crude oil breaks the  dollars a barrel barrier  th january  brent crude oil fell below  dollars a barrel this morning to touch  the lowest price since april    muller wiseman mw hold producer prices for february  th january  amidst an avalanche of further new year milk producer price cuts muller wiseman have confirmed they will not be cutting producer prices before st march at the earliest   the stand on standard litre price is ppl   mws press release contains a couple of interesting quotes   carl ravenhall managing director of müller wiseman dairies said in an extremely challenging environment müller uk  ireland group is working hard to add value to milk produced by british dairy farmers we recognise that this is a tough time for dairy farmers and we are doing everything we can to maintain a leading milk price whilst retaining our ability to compete particularly against processors and farmer owned cooperatives who reduce their milk prices with little notice   mw are acknowledging the fact  they operate in what is a british added value market not withstanding the fact cream and butter returns have impacted on both processor and producer returns  compare this declaration  to some of the other gb  milk purchasers statements where they clearly   paint  a picture that they  operate in a global market pointing the finger exclusively at weak european and world commodity prices as well as poor gdt auction results as justification for their price drops   this leads on to ravenhalls choice words in his next line highlighted in red by me   its his reference to those who reduce their prices with little if any notice  clearly mw are in competition with these processors who quickly bank any farmgate price reductions and could then mischievously use such gains to their advantage in this falling market with predatory pricing however on the flip side when prices take a turn north and go up the likes of mw who are code compliant should theoretically be paying out increases a month later than those who give no notice   ian is aware of lots of scams and interesting moves milk purchaser moves these include processors plural who have ended a number of producer contracts who are buying extra milk on the spot market short term gain as well as a number of milk buyers who are paying a farmgate price based on commodity values who then have the nerve to  trumpet how strong their brands are both locally nationally  and abroad   it sounds like these milk buyers are simply dropping the milk price simply  because they can based on global commodity prices then proceed to sell into a british added value market with their strong  brands   its a win win and resembles having your cake and eating it   ppl milk price cut for glanbia
