companies respond to international business opportunities we are a selffinancing crown corporation that operates at arms length from the government our new subsidiary development finance institution will be a specialized financial institution whose role is to support the growth and success of developing economies what do we do we provide insurance and financial services bonding products and small business solutions to canadian exporters and investors and their international buyers we also support canadian direct investment abroad and investment into canada much of our business is done in partnership with other financial institutions and through collaboration with the government of canada how we operate unlike most export credit agencies that rely on governmental annual appropriations we are financially selfsufficient and operate much like a commercial institution we collect interest on our loans and premiums on our insurance products we also have a treasury department that sells bonds and raises money in global capital markets we are committed to the principles of corporate social responsibility csr our rigorous due diligence requirements ensure that all projects and transactions we support are financially environmentally and socially responsible we believe that good business — adopting and embracing these principles while we facilitate trade for canadian investors and exporters — is good for business  page content ​ csr annual report taking responsibility read more in our corporate social responsibility annual report read the report    annual report looking for detailed information on our performance measures and highlights view our  annual report  navigating the volatility read the report   exportwiseca our online magazine for canadian exporters and investors read it be it learn more page content benefits to canada since we were founded in  we have facilitated more than  trillion in exports and foreign investment by canadian companies this is important because canada’s economy relies on trade one in three jobs depends on exports given our small domestic market canadian businesses have to think globally to compete and grow in  we helped more than  canadian companies do business in over  countries the majority of these companies were small business and more than  per cent of this business was conducted in fastgrowing emerging markets using our financial products and services our customers’ export sales and investments totalled almost  billion we estimate that this helped generate  billion of canada’s gdp contributed more than  cents for every dollar earned and helped sustain  jobs making the connections to create trade critical to canada’s trade success is the ability for canadian companies particularly smes to make a connection with international buyers but many of these companies do not have the size or visibility to make that happen particularly in emerging markets one of edc’s strategies is to help make these connections through matchmaking sessions with the canadian trade commissioners’ service through our equity investments and by leveraging our financial relationships with foreign buyers to encourage them to procure from canadian suppliers this strategy is particularly geared toward helping canadian smalland mediumsized business grow internationally partnership preferred philosophy when we work on a transaction we prefer to do it in explicit partnership with the private sector we let the private sector player set the terms and we add capacity and share the risk this encourages the private sector to move into new areas leaving us to move to new frontiers to create new trade for canada we have also signed a protocol with the business development bank of canada bdc to ensure that canadian companies looking to expand their business in global markets have access to the services and financial capacity that best suit their needs the protocol aims to improve the coordination between our two crown corporations by placing more emphasis on guiding new customers towards the core strengths of each organization we also work closely with the canadian commercial corporation our two organizations work together in the international trade space and continue to look for new areas of collaboration with a goal of continuing to improve our overall service to canadian companies page content bottom​
