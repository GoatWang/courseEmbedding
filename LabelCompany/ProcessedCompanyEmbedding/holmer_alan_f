page  source biographies  alan f holmer jd alan f holmer jd biography title director of inspire pharmaceuticals inc position pro to the question should prescription drugs be advertised directly to consumers reasoning directtoconsumer dtc advertising is an excellent way to meet the growing demand for medical information empowering consumers by educating them about health conditions and possible treatments by so doing it can play an important role in improving public health directtoconsumer advertising that encourages millions of americans to consult their physicians can help to improve public health because a number of leading diseases are under diagnosed and undertreated directtoconsumer advertising is a highly effective way to communicate the availability of treatments to the public in  the first dtc consumer television advertisement for a nicotine patch aired during the super bowl according to the american association of advertising agencies aaaa the public response was so great that within weeks demand for the patches exceeded the supply the product had been available for months but people who might have been interested in quitting smoking were simply not aware of it advertising promoted widespread awareness overnight prompted patientphysician conversations and may have helped many people to stop smoking pharmaceutical companies have both a right and a responsibility to inform people about their products under the supervision of the fda which regulates prescription drug advertising companies are committed to responsible advertising that enhances the patientphysician relationship and encourages the appropriate use of prescription drugs under a physicians supervision while such advertising prompts more people to seek professional help it does not dictate the outcome of the physician visit or the kind of help patients eventually receive directtoconsumer advertising merely motivates patients to learn more about medical conditions and treatment

managed care  april qaa conversation with alan f holmer terms of coverage for elderly top priority for drug industrywith the everrising cost of prescription drugs generating an outcry to reform medicare phrmas president finds himself in the eye of the storm as president of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america alan f holmer represents the countrys largest researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the organization lobbies on behalf of its members in washington and state capitals phrmas federal legislative priority this year is expansion of drug coverage for the elderly other recent battles have included maines attempt to impose price controls on prescription drugs and efforts to allow exported prescription drugs to be brought back to the united states for sale holmer head of phrma since  began his career working as a congressional staffer and as a tax lawyer in  president reagan appointed him deputy assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs with responsibility for liaison with state and local officials from there he went on to positions in the commerce department and in the office of the us trade representative he established and became cochairman of international trade practice for the law firm sidley  austin in  holmer has served as an adjunct professor at georgetown university law center and as a guest lecturer at various law schools and universities the coauthor or editor of three books he graduated with honors from princeton university in  and georgetown university law center in  he spoke recently with senior contributing editor patrick mullen managed care what issues are at the top of phrmas agenda alan f holmer by far the pharmaceutical industrys top priority in  is to achieve enactment of expanded prescriptiondrug coverage for medicare beneficiaries were committed to trying to achieve that ideally during this calendar year but certainly in this congressional cycle mc what do you think of the medicare prescriptiondrug proposal that the bush administration has put forward holmer were pleased by the emphasis that president bush has placed on this issue and were taking a careful look at his proposal as we look at specific proposals we think that seniors should have the same kind of health care options that members of congress have including prescriptiondrug coverage that kind of coverage would help senior citizens in two ways first they would have access to discounts on medicines that their health plans are able to negotiate with pharmacies and manufacturers these pharmacy and manufacturer discounts combined average somewhere between  and  percent second because of these discounts with many health plans seniors would make copayments as opposed to paying the full retail price for the medicine mc do you have any concerns about how heavily president bushs medicare drug benefit proposal leans on the states as the delivery mechanism are you concerned that it might not be administered evenly or that there might be some delays as states go about implementing the program holmer the key aspect of this from our perspective is to make sure that the delivery mechanism is through the private sector two proposals seem to be getting the greatest attention in the congress one is the bill that passed the house last year introduced by congressman bill thomas now chairman of the ways and means committee and speaker dennis hastert the other is the breauxfrist bill that was introduced last year and has been reintroduced this year while we have some issues with those proposals we think that they get the basic architecture of the benefit correctly we look forward to working with all members of congress — republicans and democrats — and with the bush administration to try to get this done at the earliest possible time were also going to take care that we do it in a manner thats consistent with our core principles including looking at the issue from the perspective of patients we want to make sure that patients are able to choose from a variety of competing health plans so that they will be able to select overall health coverage and a prescriptiondrug benefit that best meets their individual needs mc beyond the prescriptiondrugbenefit proposal what changes in the regulatory environment do you expect because of the change of administrations holmer its a little early to tell obviously we dont yet have a new administrator of the health care financing administration nor has there been an announcement of the new head of the food and drug administration so i think its a little early to be able to comment on the regulatory climate in washington one example of what we might expect comes out of the presidents budget were very pleased to see continued strong support for funding the national institutes of health theres an extremely positive and synergistic relationship between the nih and the pharmaceutical companies and were very pleased to see that continuing in the bush administration to the extent that issues of interest have been raised in the comments of some cabinet members during their confirmation hearings i think there is recognition of the importance of making sure that policy proposals coming from the executive branch continue to nurture biomedical innovation mc what are some examples holmer first is strong support for basic biomedical research which we see in the presidents budget with respect to the nih second there needs to be continued strong support for intellectual property protection ambassador robert zoellick the new us trade representative made comments during a senate finance committee hearing that i think show he recognizes the tremendous importance of strong intellectual property protection third we have to make sure that there is a transparent and efficient regulatory environment through the food and drug administration that will depend to a significant degree on who the new fda commissioner turns out to be certainly all of the conversations that weve had with officials in the bush administration underscore their commitment to ensuring that we have an efficient and transparent regulatory environment at the fda fourth it is imperative that pharmaceutical companies be able to sell their products in a free market environment that recognizes the extraordinary risks these companies face in getting their products to market i think theres a strong commitment on the part of the bush administration to market principles and market mechanisms and opposition to price controls which would have a significantly negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry a fifth key element is to make sure we have a global business environment that allows the americanbased pharmaceutical industry to capitalize on its comparative advantages that requires adhering to free trade principles and expanding free trade we see strong support on the part of the bush administration for continuing to nurture an environment that allows for a strong pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry mc you mentioned freemarket principles that raises the issues of price controls recently a court in maine threw out an attempt to impose price controls on drugs in that state what was wrong with the attempt in maine and should there be any curbs at all on the market holmer privatesector mechanisms can work very effectively to control costs imposing price controls would discourage private investment in drug research and development and will lead to a reduction in revenues to the pharmaceutical companies if you reduce revenues to the companies inevitably thats going to have a negative impact on their ability to continue their extraordinary record in research and development i know an example from my own personal perspective my yearold son and yearold daughter have cystic fibrosis and my kids arent alone millions of americans who have lifethreatening diseases are waiting for better treatments and better cures were tantalizingly close to coming up with a cure for cystic fibrosis to the extent that price controls are imposed on the pharmaceutical industry youre going to make the choices even more difficult for the companies with respect to what diseases they have an opportunity to focus their research on and which projects theyre just not going to be able to fund one reason the united states leads the world in pharmaceutical innovation by far is because we have a freemarket environment i think theres strong recognition across the country that people dont want to harm the wonderful records that companies have been able to achieve in bringing new medicines to market having said that are there senior citizens who dont have drug coverage and who need help with paying for their medicines absolutely thats why we are so committed to making sure that a prescriptiondrug proposal that will expand coverage for seniors is enacted into law at the earliest possible time hopefully this year mc do you think a medicare benefit will diffuse the political pressure that has arisen last fall senate candidates taking busloads of seniors across the border to canada to buy less expensive prescription drugs became a regular part of several campaigns holmer i think that pressure will be reduced senior citizens who go to canada to buy their medicines usually dont have prescriptiondrug coverage therefore theyre paying full retail price for prescriptions they dont yet have the benefit of discounts that health plans negotiate on behalf of patients they represent if you can get a privatesectororiented prescriptiondrug plan enacted into law that will provide those senior citizens with those discounts plus the overall benefits that come with having insurance political pressure is so high on this issue because that insurance coverage does not presently exist for a significant portion of our senior citizens about onethird of our senior citizens dont presently have prescriptiondrug coverage mc what would you say to those who are critical of the drug industry spending research money on what are considered lifestyle drugs such as rogaine or viagra holmer most current socalled lifestyle drugs were discovered while testing a medicine for a lifethreatening disease for example a medicine that stimulates hair growth in men was discovered during the testing of a drug that was intended to treat prostate disease the vast bulk of research dollars spent by pharmaceutical companies are directed toward lifethreatening conditions mc how well do you think the public understands that especially given the enormous amounts being spent on directtoconsumer advertising of lifestyle drugs does that skew perception of the pharmaceutical industrys priorities holmer its a good question as far as directtoconsumer advertising people often dont realize this but we have an enormous problem in this country with respect to undertreatment and underdiagnosis of disease the american diabetes association will tell you that there are  million americans who are unaware of the fact that they have diabetes yet about  percent of all health care costs in this country are related to diabetes onethird of people who suffer from severe depression in this country never even seek treatment for it millions of americans have high blood pressure but dont seek treatment for it the more information we can get out there so that patients can become more informed and have more informed conversations with their doctors the better off those patients and our health care system will be i was with the head of a major patient organization earlier this week she had exactly the same attitude that as more patients become personally involved in their own health care the fact that pharmaceutical companies are providing more information about new cures and treatments benefits patients and the health care system mc as people become more involved in their own health care do you see consumer demand changing the focus of some pharmaceutical research holmer i dont know the answer to that individual companies are going to make their own decisions as to how theyre going to spend their research dollars id leave that to them mc how is the internet changing the marketing of drugs the information people have about prescription drugs and the expectations they have when they walk into a doctors office holmer a harris poll found that  million americans went online to search for information about health in the last year so the internet is obviously an important and powerful communications tool but despite the growth and use of the internet with respect to pharmaceutical prescriptions the doctor still holds the prescribing pen if patients are going to be able to purchase medicines on the internet it should be with the doctors diagnosis and a legal and valid prescription mc arent more patients walking into doctors offices armed with information theyve downloaded about a new drug wondering why theyre not getting it holmer im sure that occurs again the more information patients have and the more informed conversations they can have with their doctors about new treatments including medicines the better off theyll be and the better care theyll receive this is the information age as consumers gain access to more information their ability to have informed conversations with their doctors and make intelligent decisions will be enhanced thats an extremely good thing mc with the recent mapping of the human genome the pharmaceutical industry appears to be on the verge of revolutionary change how is that playing out so far and where do you see it going holmer our survey last year found  biotechnology medicines in development up from  in  about half are in development for cancer  for infectious diseases including hepatitis c and malaria  for neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis parkinsons and alzheimers and  for heart disease like coronary artery and congestive heart failure genetic research affects all drug development not just our companies cuttingedge biotechnology research the research helps us to understand how the body works and what goes wrong in specific diseases ive seen this on a personal level with respect to cystic fibrosis research and gene therapy a new field involving replacing genes that are malfunctioning in some way i recently saw a fascinating piece in the washington post about cystic fibrosis research at the university of pennsylvania the challenge for cystic fibrosis research is that they know what the defective gene is and how to fix it but they havent found a mechanism to deliver the corrected gene into the body in a way that wont be rejected researchers at the university of pennsylvania are taking all the bad stuff out of the aids virus and the ebola virus and using them which are effective at latching onto the human body to deliver the new cystic fibrosis gene i dont know what kind of promise that holds but it shows the kind of breathtaking developments that are occurring with respect to gene therapy and other aspects of genetic research mc are we talking about companies conducting the same kind of research as in the past using new tools or are we looking at the emergence of a new industry holmer i dont think its a new industry but it is providing a substantial expansion of the targets of opportunity that researchers will be able to use mc over the years physicians and members of managed care plans have found it difficult to prescribe the drug they want because its not on the plans formulary is this the right way to run a drugdelivery system within a managed care setting or are there other ways of doing it that make more sense holmer there are a variety of privatesector mechanisms that can be used to help contain the overall costs of prescriptions some may involve use of formularies our view is that if formularies are used decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion of a drug from a formulary should be based on sound clinical information that is reviewed by trained health care professionals we believe any decision to include or exclude a particular medication should consider the value for the patient insurer and employer in terms of positive health outcomes — with particular emphasis on qualityoflife improvements its imperative that prescribers and patients be well informed about how decisions are made with regard to the formulary and how to obtain a nonformulary product mc why does phrma oppose reimportation of prescription drugs which some argue could bring down drug costs in this country holmer reimportation of medicines is a terrible idea going back to  every fda commissioner — republican and democrat — has raised concerns about reimportation the key issue here is control of a products chain of custody any reimportation plan enacted into law would significantly increase risk of harm to patients risk that theyd be getting counterfeit products without realizing any real savings its important to remember that in  after lengthy hearings and consideration particularly by the house energy and commerce committee congress overwhelmingly passed a landmark consumerprotection law that prohibited reimportation of medicines that were outside the manufacturers control we believe that congress made the right decision in  and it does not make sense to change that when the house considered this bill on the floor last year john dingell said make no mistake this reckless legislation never went through the committees with expertise or experience in these matters it is going to lead to needless injuries and deaths we thought that thenhealth and human services secretary donna shalala made the right decision in december  when she announced that she could not implement the law because she could not certify that patients would be safe or there would be significant savings to consumers its possible that current hhs secretary tommy thompson is going to review that decision and thats fine by us we believe that if he carefully reviews whether this reimportation provision can be implemented safely if he talks to the us customs service the fda the drug enforcement administration and the fbi he will reach what we believe is an inescapable conclusion you cannot allow reimportation of these products from overseas without putting our nations medicine supply at risk mc thank youtags qa related articles a conversation with henry

bello judith h holmer alan f read preview magazine article management review growing importance of rules of origin in a global market by bello judith h holmer alan f read preview article excerpt growing importance of rules of origin in a global market it wasnt very long ago that a products origin was largely irrelevant unless the label read made in the ussr or another communist country now a products origin can open or shut doors and may mean the difference between a companys skyrocketing sales or going out of business in that product line what changed and what does this change mean for us companies in todays global marketplace of conglomerate products with parts melded from many origins what has changed over the last two decades is the development of tariff preferences which have opened markets for some countries products and proliferating buy national requirements voluntary restraint agreements and antidumping and countervailing duty orders which have closed markets for others for example in  the united states instituted the generalized system of preferences gsp under which eligible products of specific developing countries can enter the united states duty free however to ensure that these tariff preferences are not used by other parties the trade act establishing the gsp program includes a strict rule of origin this rule allows the customs service to determine which products are and which are not eligible for gsp dutyfree treatment normally preferential treatment of certain countries would violate the fundamental rule of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which was signed in the late s by major western developed nations and governs most international trade in goods and services article i of the agreement requires all gatt parties to accord each other mostfavorednation treatment in tariff matters but because its gsp program is designed to assist maturing countries in their economic development the united states obtained a waiver from the gatts mostfavorednation requirements another example of preferential treatment under us tariff laws is the uscanada free trade agreement fta which went into effect last year under which all tariffs on imports from canada will be eliminated by  mr september  p  to ensure that the benefits of this agreement accrue only to canada and the united states negotiators worked hard to develop a more objective predictable rule of origin than the traditional highly subjective rule of substantial trasformation their success is enshrined in chapter iii of the fta and responds to the demands of the business communities on both sides of the border for greater certainty in our bilateral trade relations the fta preferential tariff treatment does not violate the gatt because one of the gatt articles authorizes more favorable treatment to countries with which a gatt party is associated in a customs union or free trade agreement the united states is not the only gatt party with tariff preferences for developing countries the european community for example has long accorded tariff preferences to imports from principally north african countries that formerly were colonies of ec member states such as morocco formerly a colony of france nontariff discrimination because of the growing trend to provide more favorable trade treatment of some developing countries gatt members increasingly have had to decide how to determine a products origin the need is further exacerbated by several marketrestricting developments such as the proliferation of voluntary restraint agreements vras under the vra concept a foreign government restricts exports of certain products to particular destinations to reduce bilateral trade tensions and avoid legislated import restraints  quotas  in the importing country but vra enforcement depends on being able to ascertain the imports origin that is did goods arriving at the importing countrys shores originate in the country that voluntarily restrained exports or did they originate in third countries … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over  million more from academic journals magazines and

championcontributed by note the content below contains the first few paragraphs of the printed article and the titles of the sidebars and boxes if applicablethe industry’s champion by kim ribbinkafter a weighty career in politics and the law and now seven years into his leadership position at the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america alan f holmer is positioning the organization to address criticisms of the industry and convey to the world at large the benefits that drug manufacturers have achieved in saving lives and enhancing the quality of life “i had spent my entire career preparing for the job at phrma” that’s how alan holmer describes his experience before taking on the top job at the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america the president and ceo of phrma finds both challenges and rewards in his position but this is a role that mr holmer is more than qualified to fill an early introduction to politics through his father years of experience in the political arena — serving senators the white house as well as various government departments — and in depth experience as a tax lawyer and later as an international trade lawyer representing among other clients the pharmaceutical manufacturers association now phrma give mr holmer the grounding he needs to represent the pharmaceutical industry in his seven years at phrma mr holmer has done much to raise the profile of the organization as an advocate and lobbying body his efforts are instrumental in positioning phrma to counter the industry’s critics in spite of phrma’s many successes challenges remain including further bolstering the industry’s image in the face of very public attacks from congressional representatives and negative media coverage to meet these challenges mr holmer draws on the advice and ideas of his staff the collective strength of the industry and his own experiencesbox alan holmer’s efforts are instrumental in positioning phrma to counter the pharmaceutical industry’s criticsbox bringing it all together in an exclusive interview with pharma voice alan f holmer president and ceo of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of americatalks about his deep appreciation of the pharmaceutical industry and his vision for bringing all health care advocates togethercan you talk about some of your achievements at phrma of which you are most proud last year i did a five year retrospective on where phrma was compared with where the organization had been five years before phrma has grown significantly — in terms of numbers of people and resources — and is much more effective as an advocacy organization today our critics often sum up best what strong advocates we are senator charles schumer who sponsored a bill in  that would have reduced the incentives for pharmaceutical innovation attributed to phrma the fact that the bill was not enacted he said “obviously if there were no phrma this bill would be law by nowphrma pulls out all the stops”what most inspires you about the pharma industry what the industry has done for my childrenmy son and daughter both have cystic fibrosis and take medicines that are inhaled into their lungs one of which is pulmozyme which is manufactured by genentech pulmozyme helps to liquefy the mucus in the lungs so germs don’t as readily become trapped there this allows patients to breathe better so they can live better my son takes an inhaled antibiotic called tobi which is manufactured by chiron these medicines have had a huge impact on my children’s health and the quality of their lives when our son was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis on march   my wife and i were told that his likely life expectancy was going to be about  years but through the grace of god terrific medical care the help of the pharmaceutical industry and some luck he’s now in his early s he teaches english and religion at dematha high school in hyattsville mdhas been an outstanding athleteand his lung function is more

councilwhich is an organization that brings together representatives from a wide variety of voluntary health agencies such as the american heart association the epilepsy foundation and other similar organizations having a broad perspective about how others perceive the pharmaceutical industry and what their priorities are in terms of a patient centered healthcare system is very beneficialwhat led to you being the recipient of the  marriott lifetime achievement award presented by the arthritis foundation and how much does that award mean to you personally and as head ofphrma i was very pleased to accept that awardnot on behalf of myselfbut on behalf of the industry that i’m privileged to represent in washington dc our companies have a number of medicines on the market for arthritis and have many other medicines that are in the pipelinechart enact a comprehensive prescription drug benefit in medicare a marketbased drug benefit that gives beneficiaries a choice of competing privatesector plans will provide high quality healthcare and affordability without compromising medical innovationavoid new pharmaceutical price controls as the experience in europe and japan shows price controls stifle innovation and compromise patient access to effective new medicinesmaintain the hatch waxman act balance this essential mechanism helps achieve a balance between the generic and innovator drugs that work for patients upsetting the hatchwaxman balance is unnecessary because competition in the drug market is already strongsupport cost control strategies that donot arbitrarily restrict drug access instead of focusing on reducing the prescription drug line itemsome health plans are emphasizing disease management programs which recognize the value of medicines in both improving patient care and offsetting other healthcare expendituresmaintain a strong industry government partnership for research in particular current patent policy for federally funded ideas and established mechanisms for cooperative public private research has hastened commercialization of technologies that otherwise might never have been usedmaintain rigorousefficient and transparent regulation of pharmaceuticals the landmark fda modernization act of  was a major step forward in enabling safe and effective new drugs and biologics to be made available sooner to patients and fda must continue to streamline its operationsrecognize the value of pharmaceuticals prescription drugs save lives alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life they also often reduce the need for other more invasive and expensive treatments a narrow focus on the cost of drugs without regard to their value and their role in the health system as a whole would discourage innovationstrengthen intellectual property protection around the globe establish the legitimacy of intellectual property protection for medicines in all countries of the worldeliminate trade barriers reduce foreign government actions that deny their patients access to lifesaving life enhancing innovative medicines through bans on information and through trade barriers that limit market accesspromote sound science in international regulatory policies eliminate nontransparent regulatory procedures that substitute political opinion for sound science i’ve spent my entire career preparing for the job at phrmapromote sound healthcare systems worldwide clarify the importance of a sound healthcare system in ensuring healthy workers abroad — a vital element for sustained economic development sourcepharmaceutical research and manufacturers of americathe road to washington from a very early age mr holmer has been groomed for a life in public service his father freeman holmer a political science professor at willamette university in salem ore became state budget director when a fellow professor and close friend mark hatfield became governor of oregon “there were lots of discussions about government and politics when i was growing up” mr holmer says “my dream then was to one day be governor of oregon”among those his father got to know as a professor was his student bob packwood who later went on to be a us senator senator packwood was a huge influence on the young alan holmer’s life and career with his heart set on public service mr holmer went to prince ton university to study politics and in the summer of his junior year he went to work for senator packwood then a junior member of the us senate after graduating mr holmer began working full time for senator packwood“i’d been on his staff for about eight months when he made me his chief of staff at the age of  which is kind of crazy looking back on it” mr holmer sayssenator packwood ultimately became chair man of the senate finance committee which has jurisdiction over medicare medicaid and all international trade issues during his six years in that position mr holmer attended law school at georgetown university at night then to gain some hands on legal experience he took a position as an associate working on tax issues at the washington dcbased law firm steptoe and johnsonthree years later in  mr holmer was given the opportunity to go to the white house he worked for the reagan administration as deputy assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs which essentially meant being a liaison with state and local officials across the country “when i became president of phrma this experience was very helpful i had the opportunity to work with governors state legislators mayors and county officials during my time at the white house” he saysperhaps most importantly the two years in the reagan administration gave mr holmer insight into how to influence policy makers most effectively from there mr holmer was named deputy assistant secretary for import administration at the commerce department with responsibility for administering the us antidumping and countervailing duty laws two years later he joined the us trade rep resentative’s office as general counsel to trade representative clayton yeutter rising to the rank of deputy us trade representative with rank of ambassador after two yearsduring this tenure mr holmer had responsibility for two major legislative initiatives — the uscanada free trade agreement and the  trade bill the omnibus trade and competitiveness actfrom the trade representative’s office mr holmer joined the washington dc office of the chicagobased law firm sidley austin as cochair of the international trade practice which broadened his perspective to a range of industries and gave him a different view of how to lobby congress and the executive branchas mr holmer continues his efforts to lobby congress among others on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry he taps into his vast experiences in facing such groups“during my time at the commerce department and the us trade representa tive office i testified before congressional committees more than  times and devel oped very strong relationships with members and staff on both sides of the political aisle especially on the finance committee and the house ways and means committee” he sayscuring the industry’s ills as many industry leaders have told pharmavoice one of the most pressing con cerns that pharmaceutical companies face is the battle with poor public image it is both the mission and responsibility of phrma as well as the goal of mr holmer to counter criticisms of the industryduring the past year mr holmer and his colleagues at phrma have increasingly been on the offensive rather than defensive for example mr holmer counters claims that the high cost of drugs is making healthcare unaf fordable pointing to a government study showing outpatient prescription medicines accounted for only  of total healthcare costs in in a speech to the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers association in berlin in october  mr holmer laid out seven principles of strategic communica tions and public affairs that phrma is imple menting the first is communicating the prac tical steps the industry is taking to improve access to medicines and improve interactions with healthcare professionals such as the code of interactions for healthcare professionals the second step is to anticipate issues and address them early third is to get the message out to critics and allies alike about the indus try’s propatient proinnovation objectives fourth phrma’s goal is to ensure it is nimble and persistent and that it develops allies who share the industry’s objectives the fifth goal is to raise the tone of the debate and ensure the messages policies and practices are sound and benefit patients sixth phrma is working to be consistent in its messaging about the value of research the industry’s dedication to cures and ensuring people have access to new medicines and the seventh goal phrma has set for itself is to be relentlessly creativemr holmer says going forward the goal is to turn what one phrma board member labeled “the cycle of doom” into a “cycle of hope” which was the underlying theme of his speech at phrma’s annual meeting this march“the cycle of doom’ starts with the claim that rapidly increasing drug costs are making healthcare unaffordable bankrupting america and ruin ing the competitiveness of american business es” he said in his address “doomsayers assert that drug costs are rising because pharmaceu tical companies are getting doctors to pre scribe — and patients to take — new more costly medicines they don’t need and that because of pharmaceutical marketing drug costs are going up  per year our critics say that like it is one word — drug costs are going up  per year — and so the cycle continues as an industry our task is to replace the cycle of doom with the cycle of hope”the cycle of hope mr holmer says “starts with the recognition that as medicines improve and increasingly treat underlying diseases and not just symptoms medical care improves with greater use of such medicines with these changes more americans are getting earlier and better treatments for diseases that once con signed them to an invariable downward spiral of disability and death the benefits grow as we tell doctors and patients — including millions of previously untreated or undertreated patients — about new medicines allowing patients to avoid or reduce hospital izations lost time at work and suffering the cycle of hope continues as part of the return on investment in each medicine is plowed back into research giving us the opportunity to make more progress against disease more improvements to healthcare and new possibilities for patients”“the cycle of hope means that medicines are a growing share of the healthcare dollar” he continues “the alternative is stagnation for instance spending on medicines would be lower without the alzheimer’s drugs that delay nursing home admissions but then we’d spend more on nursing homes not a good trade and when we invent the even bet ter alzheimer’s medicines that we need spending on drugs will go up some more that’s a big problem if you believe in the cycle of doom it’s exactly what should happen if you believe in the cycle of hope”in his interview with pharmavoice mr holmer points to medicines for the treatment of diabetes as another example of the advances made by the industry “as a society americans are becoming more and more overweight and there has been a significant increase in the num ber of americans with diabetes” he says “in the last decade spending on medicines to treat diabetes skyrocketed from  billion to  billion that’s a  increase in one decade more than threequarters of this increase went to newer oral medicines our critics would say we can’t possibly afford a  increase in spending on diabetes medicines”but mr holmer contends that those who look at the facts will see at work the cycle of hope rather than the cycle of doom“spending has increased in part because the number of patients diagnosed with diabetes increased by almost half over the past decade” he says “we’re treating far more patients we’re treating them earlier and more aggres sively since we now know that keeping blood glucose levels lower and more tightly con trolled slows or avoids the progression of this disease’s terrible complications“as we’ve gained better understanding of diabetes we’ve brought five new classes of medicines to patients since ” he continues “these medicines greatly expand treat ment options allowing physicians to better tailor treatment to individual patients’ needs increased spending on medicines for diabetes patients can help achieve overall savings on their health costs and avoid hospitalizations the cycle of hope continues as america’s phar maceutical companies work toward a cure for diabetes today there are many new pharma ceutical treatments in development ranging from inhaled forms of insulin that would not require injections to compounds that modify the metabolism of fat cells to proteins that promote increased insulin production when blood sugar levels are high and much more”mr holmer recognizes the challenges the industry faces in winning the publicaffairs war telling phrma executives that there is “no silver bullet that will allow us to replace the paradigm of doom with our vision of hope”“some look at the increasing use of medicines and the shift to newer medicines as problems to be solved not solutions for patients and contributions to affordable healthcare” mr holmer said in his annual address “they don’t want to acknowledge the data showing that even wellinsured patients underuse asthma medicines and antidepressants they don’t want to focus on the need for more use of medicines to treat heart disease hypertension and other conditions these are facts that we need to drive into policy debates there are a number of broken axles in our healthcare system the modern miracle of pharmaceuticals isn’t one of them”chart advocating a path alan holmer — resume present president and ceo the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america washington dc phrma represents the country’s leading

washingtondcbox phrmahead calls for “right kind”of drug benefit this year in january of this year alan f holmer president and ceo of the pharmaceuticalresearch and manufacturers of america phrma told the epilepsy foundation that phrma continues to strongly support a medicare prescription drug benefit plan — one that covers all seniors and the disabled and relies on marketbased solutions to keep costs down — and urged the new congress to pass a plan this year while not endorsing any specific legislation mr holmer said the key ele ments of a bipartisan medicare prescription drug plan should ensure all seniors have access to the medicines they needpromote choicerely on the private sector to promote competitionandrespect the doctorpatient relationship“america’s seniors deserve access to the best medicines we can invent” mr holmer says “that’s why phrma is working to help enact prescription drug coverage that gives all medicare beneficiaries the same kind of quality private market drug coverage that  million other americans — including members of congress — now enjoy”mrholmer also pointed out that amedicareprescription drug ben efit shouldhelp states with their budget problems by paying for much of the drug costs of the million seniors eligible for both medicareand medicaidaccording to the congressional budget officethese savings would reach an estimated  billion between  and “prescription medicines make up only  cents out of the health care dollar” mr holmer says “when you consider this prescription drugs are an extraordinary value”he cited examples of drugs that help more than a million epilepsy patients control their seizures protease inhibitors that have helped reduce aids deaths in the united states by cholesterollowering drugs that are preventing thousands of heart attacks each year and medicines that allow children with asthma to breathe freely and go to school rather than to the emergency roomit is both the mission and responsibility of phrma as well as the goal of mrholmer to counter criticisms of the industry  there are a number of broken axles in our healthcare systemthe modern miracle of pharmaceuticals isn’t one of themmaking sense of it all according to mr holmer it makes no sense for pharmaceutical companies to discover and develop new medicines if doctors and patients don’t know they exist“that’s why we work to inform doctors about treatment options” mr holmer said during his address “we also share information about our products directly with consumers consumer health information on pharmaceuti cals has brought millions of patients into need ed medical care according to research by the fda and others it also enhances patients’ com pliance with physiciandirected treatment despite these proven successes our industry’s product advertising is often criticized in the united states and it’s just plain forbidden in europe where governmentrun health systems have adopted a policy of don’t tell don’t ask’ don’t tell patients about innovative medicines and they hope that patients don’t ask“we fight for consumer health information so that all patients can get the best medicines their doctor prescribes for them with their unique medical needs” mr holmer adds “it’s time for us to stop just defending promotion and to start calling on its critics to explain their opposition for example the critics should explain either that they prefer millions of patients remain untreated or just what is their different and better way for helping them i’ll bet their alternative has three hallmarks more government restricted information and little patient choice”the choice may be clear to mr holmer but his organization still faces opposition from industry critics even in light of phrma’s establishing guidelines that outline acceptable interaction procedures between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providersafter months of discussions with pharma ceutical executives phrma last year intro duced the code of interactions for healthcare professionals some critics however have raised concerns about the fact that the code is voluntary saying the initiative will only have teeth if it is mandatory mr holmer rejects that criticism saying evidence so far shows overall compliance with the code’s objectives“as far as i know every phrma company which is every major pharmaceutical company in america is implementing the code” he comments “and i’m told from a variety of sources that they have seen a significant change in the marketplace as a result of the change in company behavior so my sense is that the code has been very successful”phrma also recently recast its strategic and public affairs division in an effort to be more aggressive in addressing indus try critics rather than letting the media dictate the agenda “what we want to do is build a public affairs program that real ly takes the initiative in driving messages through the earned media and paid media and my objective is to reallocate resources so that instead of being on the defense we spend at least onethird of our time being on the offensive and getting our positive messages out” he says “phrma needs to make sure that the people in the media and the public understand what’s driv ing healthcare costs — and it is an utterly erroneous message that the cost of drugs is making healthcare unaffordable we also need to build common ground with a variety of allies and develop longterm committed relationships with patient groups with doctors with medical researchers and with others”among the key initiatives mr holmer and his team are pushing for this year is a medicare prescription drug benefit plan “our top priority at phrma is making sure that congress enacts a meaning ful medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors and the disabled” he saysmoving forward belief in what the industry does and what it is trying to achieve certainly help mr holmer as he and phrma strive to put forward the industry’s message but belief and determina tion alone are not enough to achieve those goalsrussel a bantham executive vp and chief operating officer of phrma says mr holmer’s greatest gifts are his ability “to lead establish a vision for an organization and motivate and empower individuals to be the best they can be he’s a good judge of character and individuals’ capabilities”others close to mr holmer cite his abilities “in negotiation in advocacy before the congress advocacy generally and also in bringing people together”mr holmer adds “at phrma i’ve hired people who are a lot smarter than i am in their individual areas of expertise i have given them lots of running room and resources so they can succeed”mr holmer has put to good use the lessons he has learned from the influential people in his life he says senator packwood taught him that loyalty in an orga nization shouldn’t only flow from the bottom up but from the top down as well malcolm baldrige the sec retary of commerce when mr holmer was there taught him the importance of taking responsibility for mistakes those closest to mr holmer — his parents his older brother his wife and his children — have provided him with extraordinarily valuable life lessonsmr holmer is justifiably proud of his success in improving the effectiveness of phrma“seven years ago i said my goal was to make phrma the finest advocacy organiza tion in america and i believe that we are” he says “phrma is a model at the international level at the federal level and at the state level there’s no better advocacy organization”box it’s time for us to stop just defending promotion and to start calling on its critics to explain their oppositioni’ll bet their alternative has three hallmarksmore government restricted informationand little patient choicepharmavoice
