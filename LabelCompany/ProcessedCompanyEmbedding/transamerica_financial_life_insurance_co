can but weve worked hard to offer the easiest life insurance shopping experience youll find online we offer the widest selection of arated life insurance companies so that you can find the right policy for youalso any policy you see on our site wont be any cheaper at another comparison site thats because each life insurance company files its rates with state regulators and everyone is required to show those filed rates and if you see the same policy for a cheaper rate on another site  make sure youre comparing apples to apples is it for the same amount and term did the other site

are similar across the life insurers we work with so we never play favorites want to know how much commission we make feel free to ask usare the life insurance quotes on the policygenius site accuratewe like to say were in the business of no surprises our life insurance quotes are the most accurate available online today other sites take your basic information and show you the best health class and price thats not the right way to quote we collect more health information upfront to show the most accurate quotes possible as long as you give us accurate informationif the price on our site is higher than youre seeing elsewhere for the same policy that site may not be showing you an accurate quote over  of policies we sell are within  of what we quoted onlineif our site cant instantly quote you which happens when someone has a more complicated health history one of our licensed advisors can custom quote youshouldnt i buy directly from a life insurance companytheres no reason to and a very big reason not to first you dont save any money by buying directly from the life insurance company by law the price you get from a given life insurance company is the same through them or through an agent or broker second the rate you get quoted may not be the rate youre approved at life insurance companies do a process called undewriting in which they look at your health history and risk profile to determine whether the rate they quoted is actually accurate if you apply with the life insurance company directly and youre approved at a different rate youre stuck they wont help you figure out if you can get a better offer elsewhere if you apply through policygenius well shop that offer around to every life insurance company we work with to see if they can beat it
