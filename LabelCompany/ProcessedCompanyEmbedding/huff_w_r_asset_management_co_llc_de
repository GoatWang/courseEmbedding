power of attorney from its clients to bring this lawsuit has constitutional standing to sue for violations of federal securities laws on behalf of its clients who are the beneficial owners of the underlying securities and not in its own name this question is before us on an interlocutory appeal of two orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lawrence m mckenna judge—entered august   and october  —denying a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and adhering to that ruling on a motion for

corp sec and derivatives litig no  mdl lmm  wl  at  sdny may   describing the background of the litigation plaintiffappellee wr huff asset management co llc huff is an investment advisor for institutional investors such as public employee pension funds huff alleges that defendantsappellants— all firms that provided underwriting auditing or legal services—prepared facilitated or certified inaccurate and misleading disclosures in adelphias financial statements in violation of sections  and a of the securities act of   usc §§ k l a and sections b and  of the securities exchange act of   usc §§ j b r huff brings this lawsuit as the investment adviser and attorneyinfact on behalf of certain purchasers of  debt securities issued by adelphia d amcompl  huff does not allege that it was an investor in adelphia instead huff claims that it provided investment advice to its clients and from  until  purchased adelphia securities on their behalf these clients not huff have suffered financial losses as a result of aldelphias collapse indeed huff explicitly disclaims that it suffered an injury individually in a way that is separate from its agency function transcript of feb   hearing  see also id at  we are not seeking damages except on behalf of the beneficial owners of the securities from whom we secured powers of attorney defendants challenged huffs constitutional standing to sue on behalf of its investment clients in a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure which concerns a federal courts lack of subject matter jurisdiction relying in part on indemnified capital invs sa v rj obrien  assocs inc  fd   th cir concluding that an investment advisor did not have standing where beneficial owners did not assign their rights to sue to the investment advisor the district court initially concluded that huffs status as attorneyinfact satisfied the requirements of constitutional standing see huff i  wl  at  defendants brought a motion for reconsideration arguing that the district court had overlooked our decision in advanced magnetics inc v bayfront partners inc  fd  d cir in which we held that a company that possessed powers of attorney from aggrieved shareholders but did not have a valid assignment of the shareholders claims lacked constitutional standing to sue on behalf of the shareholders see id at  the grant of a power of attorney  is not the equivalent of an assignment of ownership and standing alone a power of attorney does not enable the grantee to bring suit in his own name nonetheless the district court adhered to its original decision and distinguished advanced magnetics on the ground that huff was not only an attorneyinfact but also an investment advisor with unfettered discretion to make investment decisions see huff ii  wl  at  here  in addition to the powers of attorney huff was given by its clients huff was also the clients investment advisor with unrestricted decision making power over the clients investments including those in adelphia securities the district court cited as an analogous decision weinberg v atlas air worldwide holdings inc  frd   sdny in which an investment advisor that brought a lawsuit on behalf of its clients was found to have statutory standing to sue as a purchaser of securities because the investment advisor was the attorneyinfact and had unrestricted authority to make investment decisions for its clients see huff ii  wl  at  on appeal defendantsappellants argue that the district court misapplied advanced magnetics because the central inquiry of that case was whether an investment advisors clients properly assigned title or ownership of their securities claims to the named plaintiff not whether the named plaintiff had previously purchased securities for its clients see advanced magnetics  fd at  observing that a valid assignment must transfer at least title or ownership  to accomplish a completed transfer of the entire interest of the assignor in the particular subject of the assignment internal quotation marks and citation omitted huff replies with a different interpretation of advanced magnetics according to huff an assignment of claims is sufficient to confer standing but is not necessary for standing to be found under huffs interpretation its status as both attorneyinfact and investment advisor provides equally sufficient grounds for constitutional standing we note that nowhere in this appeal in the proceedings below or in its complaint has huff alleged that its clients—the beneficial owners—assigned title or ownership of their claims to huff while this case was pending before us the supreme court held in sprint communications co lp v apcc servs inc that an assignee who holds legal title to an injured partys claim has constitutional standing to pursue that claim even if the assignee has agreed to remit all proceeds from the litigation to the assignor see  us   sct    ledd   the parties have submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing the relevance of sprint to the outcome of this case we therefore take this opportunity to discuss the enduring elements of advanced magnetics in light of sprint although we are mindful that our central inquiry—whether huff has constitutional standing to sue on behalf of its clients— was decided by the district court without the benefit of the supreme courts most recent guidance discussion we review de novo whether a plaintiff has constitutional standing to sue see eg fuentes v bd of educ of city of new york  fd   d cir because standing is challenged on the basis of the pleadings we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party united states v vazquez  fd   d cir quoting warth v seldin  us    sct   ledd   as an initial matter we disagree with the district courts ruling that constitutional standing may be assessed using the test for statutory standing developed in weinberg  frd at  a case involving the appointment of a lead plaintiff pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act see huff ii  wl  at  the reasoning of weinberg applies with equal force to standing under the securities laws and standing under article iii weinberg identified two factors for determining whether investment advisors have statutory standing as purchasers under section b of the securities exchange act  the investment advisor has unrestricted decision making authority to invest the securities at issue and  the investment advisor is also the attorneyinfact for its clients ie it has obtained the powers of attorney from its clients  frd at  these statutory factors are separate and apart from the elements of constitutional standing which are set forth below and cannot be used to avoid constitutional requirements see gladstone realtors v village of bellwood  us    sct   ledd   in no event may congress abrogate the art iii minima article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies us const art iii §  in order to ensure that this bedrock caseorcontroversy requirement is met courts require that plaintiffs establish their standing as the proper parties to bring suit raines v byrd  us    sct   ledd   see also id one element of the caseorcontroversy requirement is that appellees based on their complaint must establish that they have standing to sue daimlerchrysler corp v cuno  us    sct   ledd   determining that a matter before the federal courts is a proper case or controversy under article iii therefore assumes particular importance in ensuring that the federal judiciary respects the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts in a democratic society internal quotation marks omitted article iii standing consists of three irreducible elements  injuryinfact which is a concrete and particularized harm to a legally protected interest  causation in the form of a fairly traceable connection between the asserted injuryinfact and the alleged actions of the defendant and  redressability or a nonspeculative likelihood that the injury can be remedied by the requested relief see lujan v defenders of wildlife  us    sct   ledd   these requirements ensure that a plaintiff has a sufficiently personal stake in the outcome of the suit so that the parties are adverse see baker v carr  us    sct   ledd   have plaintiffs alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for the illumination of difficult constitutional questions as a general rule the injuryinfact requirement means that a plaintiff must have personally suffered an injury see eg lujan  us at  n   sct  by particularized we mean that the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way valley forge christian college v americans united for separation of church and state inc  us    sct   ledd   article iii requires the party who invokes the courts authority to show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant internal quotation marks omitted baker  us at   sct  indeed the article iii judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party warth  us at   sct  see also moose lodge no  v irvis  us    sct   ledd   stating that a party may invoke the courts authority only in order to seek redress for injury done to him  not to seek redress for injuries done to others as we noted above huff has not alleged in its complaint that it suffered any injury rather the alleged injury was suffered by huffs clients therefore the dispositive question is whether huff as the named plaintiff can demonstrate an injuryinfact through some other means such as an assignment of claims courts may permit a party with standing to assign its claims to a third party who will stand in the place of the injured party and satisfy the constitutional requirement of an injuryinfact see vermont agency of natural res v united states ex rel stevens  us    sct   ledd   observing that in certain circumstances the assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor accord connecticut v physicians health servs of conn inc  fd   d cir a valid and binding assignment of a claim or a portion thereof—not only the right or ability to bring suit—may confer standing on the assignee emphasis in original we addressed the assignment of claims in advanced magnetics the case discussed by the district court upon reconsideration of its initial ruling the injured parties in that case assigned the power to commence and prosecute lawsuits to the named plaintiff see  fd at  we explained that the transfer of title or ownership did not require a particular form  so long as the language manifested the intention to transfer at least title or ownership  to accomplish a completed transfer of the entire interest of the assignor in the particular subject of the assignment id at  emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted we noted however that the agreement at issue did not transfer title or ownership of the claim to the assignee but rather permitted the assignor to retain the right to terminate the plaintiffassignees authority to pursue the assigned claims see id at  in consequence the assignment amounted to little more than a grant of a power of attorney but as we further explained the grant of a power of attorney is not the equivalent of an assignment of ownership and standing alone a power of attorney does not enable the grantee to bring suit in his own name id at  accordingly we found that the plaintiffassignee lacked standing as noted above the supreme court recently held that an assignee who holds legal title to an injured partys claim has constitutional standing to pursue the claim even if the assignee has agreed to remit all proceeds from the litigation to the assignor sprint  sct at  in so holding the court relied on an historical practice of federal courts that permitted assignees to bring suits in their own right when they were assigned title for the sole purpose of collection id at  see also rosenblum v dingfelder  fd   d cir concluding that a valid assignment of right to bring suit conferred standing on assignee but see sprint  sct at  roberts cj dissenting contending that historical practice required both legal title and a stake in the proceeds the court determined that the assignees who did not suffer a direct or personal injury as a result of defendants conduct satisfied the injuryinfact requirement because the assignment also transferred the assignors claims for injuries id at  moreover the court explicitly rejected the argument that assignees lacked standing because they planned to remit the litigation proceeds to the assignors id at  what does it matter what the aggregators do with the money afterward in our view sprint makes clear that the minimum requirement for an injuryinfact is that the plaintiff have legal title to or a proprietary interest in the claim id at  there is an important distinction between simply hiring a lawyer and assigning a claim to a lawyer on the lawyers promise to remit litigation proceeds the latter confers a property right which creditors might attach the former does not emphases added moreover sprint rejects the notion advanced by the chief justice and the three other dissenting justices that the injuryinfact prong of the article iii standing requirement mandates more than legal ownership at the time of suit see id at  roberts cj dissenting the majority concludes that a private litigant may sue in federal court despite having to pass back all proceeds of the litigation thus depriving that party of any stake in the outcome of the litigation sprint therefore implicitly supports the holding of advanced magnetics that a mere powerofattorney—ie an instrument that authorizes the grantee to act as an agent or an attorneyinfact for the grantor see blacks law dictionary  th ed—does not confer standing to sue in the holders own right because a powerofattorney does not transfer an ownership interest in the claim by contrast an assignment of claims confers legal title or ownership of those claims and thus fulfills the constitutional requirement of an injuryinfact see advanced magnetics  fd at  distinguishing power of attorney from assignment of ownership for the purposes of standing accord indemnified capital invs  fd at  if the investment advisors customers were interested in bringing this claim against the defendants they could very easily have assigned their rights to the investment advisor thus  we are of the opinion that the investment advisor has failed to satisfy the constitutional requirements  of standing in the instant case huffs clients have not transferred ownership of or title to their claims to huff as required by both sprint and advanced magnetics rather huff claims it is empowered by powers of attorney to bring a lawsuit in its representative capacity huffs powerofattorney permits it to serve as an agent of its clients and to conduct litigation on behalf of its clients as their attorneyinfact but like the relationship at issue in advanced magnetics huffs powerofattorney is not purported to be a valid assignment and does not confer a legal title to the claims huff brings while huff enjoys the authority to make some decisions concerning litigation it does not have an ownership stake in any claims its clients might pursue against defendants see advanced magnetics  fd at  on the face of the complaint huffs only interest in this litigation as an attorneyinfact is the recovery of its legal fees which are a byproduct of the suit itself and cannot serve as a basis for article iii standing see vermont agency of natural res  us at   sct   internal quotation marks omitted see also diamond v charles  us    sct   ledd   holding that an interest in attorneys fees is insufficient for standing purposes huff argues that it qualifies for a prudential exception to the injuryinfact requirement because of its authority to make investment decisions on behalf of its clients see appellees br at   there are indeed a few wellrecognized prudential exceptions to the injuryinfact requirement these exceptions permit thirdparty standing where the plaintiff can demonstrate  a close relationship to the injured party and  a barrier to the injured partys ability to assert its own interests see kowalski v tesmer  us    sct   ledd   in an opinion concerning whether criminal defense attorneys could pursue certain claims on behalf of their clients observing that generally a party seeking thirdparty standing must demonstrate a close relationship with the person who possesses the right and that the possessor would face a hindrance to protecting his own interest midhudson catskill rural migrant ministry inc v fine host corp  fd   d cir a plaintiff seeking thirdparty standing in federal court must  demonstrate a close relation to the injured third party and a hindrance to that partys ability to protect its own interests internal quotation marks omitted in this vein courts historically have permitted trustees to bring suits to benefit their trusts guardians ad litem to bring suits to benefit their wards receivers to bring suit to benefit their receiverships assignees in bankruptcy to bring suit to benefit bankrupt estates and executors to bring suit to benefit testator estates sprint  sct at  see also smith v org of foster families for equality  reform  us   n   sct   ledd   recognizing thirdparty standing for foster parents to raise claims on behalf of foster children we reject huffs assertion of a prudential exception based on investment manager standing see appellees br at  first the investment advisorclient relationship is not the type of close relationship courts have recognized as creating a prudential exception to the thirdparty standing rules see kowalski  us at   sct  discussing specific examples of thirdparty standing second huff has failed to demonstrate that absent a recognition of its standing claim there is a hindrance to the beneficial owners ability to protect their own interests id rather the beneficial owners are relatively sophisticated parties with a demonstrated capacity to protect their own interests in the absence of huffs intervention indeed several of huffs clients have filed parallel individual suits in the adelphia litigation and others have proceeded as part of a class action pursuing similar claims see ante n  therefore huff does not qualify for a prudential exception to the injuryinfact requirement finally huff posits in its briefs but not in its complaint that it satisfies the injuryinfact requirement because it has suffered two injuries stemming from its capacity as investment advisor first huff asserts that its reputation was sullied as a result of the decision to invest in adelphia bonds for its clients second huff suggests that it has suffered an informational injury as a result of its reliance on the untruthful information provided by aldelphia when huff purchased aldelphia securities for its clients huff contends that the provision of untruthful information by defendants violated its right under the relevant statutes to receive truthful and accurate information about the publiclytraded securities it purchased in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and impaired its performance as an investment advisor however huff has brought this suit on behalf of its clients not itself the remedies sought in the complaint—principally money damages associated with the losses suffered by huffs clients—would not redress either the alleged injury to huffs reputation or its informational injury see vermont agency of natural res  us at   sct  the interest asserted for standing purposes must consist of obtaining compensation for or preventing the violation of a legally protected right see also steel co v citizens for a better environment  us    sct   ledd   relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court accordingly these alleged injuries are not sufficient to confer standing on huff conclusion to summarize  huff lacks constitutional standing to bring suit for violations of the federal securities laws in its own name but on behalf of its clients the beneficial owners of the relevant securities  huff has not demonstrated an injuryinfact because it does not have legal title or ownership of its clients claims against adelphia  huffs status as both an attorneyinfact for litigation purposes and an investment advisor with unfettered discretion over its clients investment decisions does not confer on huff article iii standing to sue in a representative capacity on its clients behalf the judgment of the district court is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion footnotes  proceeding in parallel with the instant action are two sets of related actions also assigned to judge mckenna in which some of huffs clients are participating  a class action suit proceeding as part of the multidistrict litigation related to the adelphia collapse in re adelphia commcns corp sec  derivative litig no cv et al sdny and  individual actions brought by some of huffs clients in their own names see eg new york city employees ret sys v adelphia comm corp nos cv  cv edpa los angeles county employees ret assn v rigas no cv sdny  in its briefs to the district court and this court but not in its complaint huff avers that it suffered informational injuries and damage to its reputation as a result of adelphias misstatements and the poor performance of the adelphia bonds that huff bought for its clients nonetheless according to huffs complaint the only award that would not ultimately flow to huffs clients is presumably the costs and expenses in this litigation including reasonable attorneys fees which huff requests in its prayer for relief d amcompl   defendantsappellants also challenged huffs statutory standing under rule b its failure to comply with the real party in interest requirement under rule a and its failure to name all parties under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure the district court denied relief on all of these grounds see huff i  wl  at  however the only issue on appeal is whether huff lacked constitutional standing to sue we express no view on the denial of defendants motion to dismiss on any other ground  huffs complaint names parties that are not participating in this appeal as defendants including members of adelphias senior management d amcompl  for purposes of this case we need not decide when in the context of a class action under the pslra an investment advisor could qualify as a suitable lead plaintiff we note however that district courts should be mindful that named plaintiffs in a class action must allege and show that they personally have been injured not that injury has been suffered by other unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent unless they can thus demonstrate the requisite case or controversy between themselves personally and defendants none may seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class warth  us at   sct  quoting oshea v littleton  us    sct   ledd    we address huffs claims of direct injuries made for the first time in its briefs post  the holding of sprint—that an assignee of a legal claim has standing even if the assignee will transmit any recovery to the assignor—is compatible with other cases in which we have examined the contours of a valid assignment see eg physicians health servs of conn inc  fd at  requiring that the remedies being sought  flow to the named plaintiff as assignee but not addressing how the assignee has contracted to dispose of those remedies after the lawsuit  we have recently considered a roughly analogous assignment relationship—that between a qui tam relator and the united states see us ex rel eisenstein v city of new york  fd   d cir distinguishing the role of a relator as the person responsible for prosecuting the action from that of the united states as the real partyininterest which under the applicable substantive law has the legal right which is sought to be enforced or is the party entitled to bring suit citation and internal quotation marks omitted  huff notes that some of the causes of action alleged have a socalled eyeball reliance requirement which requires that the plaintiff personally have read and relied on the misstatements because huff and not its clients eyeballed—that is received and relied on— the adelphia information its clients would be precluded from bringing suit because the clients did not rely on the fraudulent information themselves we take no view on whether in these circumstances huffs clients would be precluded from suit for these violations because the issue is not before us  the allegation that huff itself sustained an injury first arose in huffs opposition to the motion to dismiss we express no view as to whether an injury to huffs reputation as an investor or an informational injury—ie a harm stemming from an entitys alleged withholding of truthful information see appellees br at —constitute cognizable claims had they been properly pleaded comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is

temkin morvillo abramowitz grand iason  silberberg pc new york ny on the brief for timothy j rigas peter fleming jr benard v preziosi jr on the brief for john j rigas before us are two petitions for a writ of mandamus brought by wr huff asset management co llc et al “the huff petitioners” and eminence capital llc et al “the class action petitioners” and together with huff petitioners “the petitioners”   both petitions seek to vacate a settlement agreement of a forfeiture action among the united states and john j rigas timothy j rigas and other members of the rigas family that establishes a  million fund to compensate victims of a fraud perpetrated in part by john j rigas and timothy j rigas   both petitions are based on the recentlyenacted crime victims rights act of  “cvra” or “the act”  usc § because the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the settlement agreement we deny both petitionsi backgrounda factsin july  a jury found john j rigas and timothy j rigas “the rigases” guilty of securities fraud conspiracy to commit securities fraud false statements in securities and exchange commission “sec” filings and bank fraud   see dist ct dkt sht no cr at  entry   the jury acquitted michael j rigas on various charges in the indictment and deadlocked on others   the government has indicated its intent to retry michael rigas on the deadlocked chargesthe petitioners and their clients allege they purchased highyield debt securities issued by adelphia communications corporation “adelphia” a company founded by john j rigas in reliance on materially false and misleading statements resulting in money damages to them   see huff mot at    apart from the criminal case the petitioners along with other plaintiffs filed individual actions against the rigases and other defendantsincluding deloitte  touche llp investment and commercial banks and lawyersunder various provisions of the securities act of  and the securities exchange act of    see dist ct dkt sht no md   the actions are still pending in the district court   see id   the sec has also brought a civil action under the securities exchange act of  against among others john j rigas timothy j rigas michael j rigas and james rigas   see dist ct dkt sht no cvin april  the government entered into a proposed settlement agreement “the settlement agreement” with the rigases and other members of the rigas family who had either not been named or were not convicted in the criminal action  see huff mot at exh d settlement agreement   under the settlement agreement the entire rigas family consented to forfeiture of designated assets including numerous cable television systems companies adelphia securities and real estate holdings   see id at ¶¶    in exchange the government agreed not to request an order of restitution or a criminal fine against john j rigas and timothy j rigas at their sentencing and not to seek “further forfeiture restitution fine or other economic sanction or recovery in relation to the ownership control or management of adelphia by the rigas family”  id at ¶¶    paragraph  of the settlement agreement further provided in relevant partas a condition to receiving a distribution from the forfeited assets or the victim fund the attorney general shall require any such victim recipient other than adelphia to release and discharge the rigas family except for john j rigas and timothy j rigas and peter l venetis from any and all actions claims or liabilities of any nature in relation to the ownership control or management of adelphia by the rigas family ․ and to dismiss any such claim or litigation commenced by such recipient against the rigas family except for john j rigas and timothy j rigas or peter l venetis   such recipients shall also reduce and mark satisfied any judgment that they obtain against third parties or otherwise indemnify the rigas family except for john j rigas and timothy j rigas and peter l venetis to the extent of any liability for contribution indemnity or the like of the rigas family other than john j rigas and timothy j rigas or peter l venetis to the third party on account of such judgmenthuff mot at exh d at ¶ at the same time the government also entered into a nonprosecution agreement with adelphia   see huff mot at exh h letter   the nonprosecution agreement provided that if adelphia forbore from criminal activity and continued to cooperate with the government the government would not charge the company for the criminal actions of its executives relating to the crimes of which the rigases were convicted   see id   the nonprosecution agreement also provided that adelphia would pay the government  million for a victim compensation fund “victim fund” which would distribute funds to eligible victims “in such forms and amounts as determined by the attorney general and the sec in their sole discretion subject to any applicable court approval process”  id at on april   the government moved for the district court to designate the case as one with “multiple crime victims” under subsection d of the crime victims rights act of  “cvra” codified at  usc §    see huff mot at exh f order at exh  affirmation   the government argued that there were tens of thousands of victims of the crimes committed by the rigases and that it was virtually impossible to identify and notify each victim personally   see id at  the government proposed an alternative plan for notification involving a listing of the settlement and other agreements reached with adelphia and the rigases at a website maintained by the department of justice   see id at    the district court filed an order directing any person or entity wishing to be heard concerning the settlement agreement to make a written submission by may   and the court scheduled a hearing on the governments motion for may     see huff mot at exh f amended order   petitioners objected to the settlement raising arguments under the cvra see huff mot at exh c class action mot at exh at the may  hearing the government described to the district court the numerous steps it had taken to notify potential victims of the proposed settlement   see huff mot at exhg transcript at    those steps included  on april   the government provided the bankruptcy court presiding over the bankruptcy action brought by adelphia against the rigases with copies of the proposed settlement agreement and other agreements and served the parties listed in the bankruptcy proceedings with notice of the settlement   in addition the government contacted the company and the equity committee involved in the adelphia bankruptcy proceedings and asked them to provide information about the proposed agreements to any potential victims   the government also submitted the agreements to the district court hearing the civil action brought by the sec against various members of the rigas family   the government further held a press conference during which it disseminated information about the agreements on national television and issued a press release to media outlets throughout the united states   on april   the government posted on its designated website copies of the proposed settlement and other agreements along with contact information for the victim witness coordinator at the united states attorneys office in the southern district of new yorkat the may  hearing various objectors including the petitioners herein were heard and the following colloquy inter alia occurredthe court  tell me what the government should do now that they have not done and how long it would take and what impact that would have on the sentence of the rigasesattorney for class action petitioners  your honor there is no question that hiring the claims administrator tomorrow and sending out notice to determine who the victims are and how to allocate those funds would delay the sentencing set for june  but i think the governmentthe court  how long would it delay it   monthsassistant united states attorney  yearsattorney for class action petitioners  i think your honor it would certainly delay the matter for monthsthe court  yes thats unacceptable   that is unacceptable   you would have to satisfy me that that type of a delay was necessary to ensure compliance with the statute and fairness to the victims and would be of sufficient value to run the risk of this whole global settlement coming aparthuff mot at exh g transcript at    at the conclusion of the hearing the district court accepted the settlement subject to the approval of  the district court judge presiding over the action brought against the rigases by the sec and  the bankruptcy judge presiding over the action brought by adelphia against the rigases and other parties  see id at    the district court found that “obviously the settlement order entails the interests of many diverse parties and reflects obvious compromises” but that “the alternatives to this settlement are not at all attractive not only in terms of the complexity and the contingencies which would result”  id the district court filed an opinion and order consistent with its oral opinion   see huff mot at exh ab huffs mandamus petitionthe huff petitioners argue that mandamus relief is warranted because the settlement agreement violates the cvraspecifically §§ a and in that it subjects them to “a hobsons choice of either foregoing compensation from the approximately  million in victim fund proceeds or accepting a distribution under an asyet unknown plan of allocation under unreasonable constraints that unnecessarily jeopardize the viability of their civil claims against other participants in the adelphia fraud”   see huff mot at  according to the huff petitioners the settlement violates the victims rights under the cvra to be treated fairly and to be provided with full and timely restitution   see idthe huff petitioners further contend that paragraph  of the settlement agreement is unfair under the cvra because the settlement agreement violates the mandatory victim restitution act “mvra” codified at  usc § a by making “it virtually impossible for victims to obtain anything close to full recovery for their losses”   see id at    they argue that the settlement agreement “places victims in a worse position than they would be in had the court ordered the rigas defendants to pay restitution under the mvra” id at c class action petitioners mandamus petitionthe class action petitioners also assert that they were denied their right to restitution arguing that “the government sought an order designating this matter as a case involving multiple crime victims in order to avoid the victims right to full and timely restitution” and that “the district court ignored the governments failure to satisfy its obligations under the cvra and under the attorney general guidelines for victim and witness assistance”   see class action petition     with respect to the notification provision of the cvra they contend that the government failed to make its “best efforts” to identify and personally notify all the crime victims as required by § c  see idthe class action petitioners also contend that they were not afforded an opportunity to confer with the government concerning the disposition of the casea right enumerated in § a   see id at    in addition they argue that   the district court did not have the authority to approve the settlement agreement at the may  hearing because the notice to victims merely stated that the hearing was for the purpose of addressing the governments motion to use alternative victimnotification procedures not for approving the settlement   the nonprosecution agreement between adelphia and the government violated laws governing civil and criminal forfeitures  and  the district court improperly rejected the class action petitioners challenges to the governments proposed notice procedures because those procedures omitted material facts and violated federal and new york laws   see id at ii statutory framework and standard of reviewenacted in october of  the cvra provides “crime victims” with the following eight rights the right to be reasonably protected from the accused the right to reasonable accurate and timely notice of any public court proceeding or any parole proceeding involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused the right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding unless the court after receiving clear and convincing evidence determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release plea sentencing or any parole proceeding the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the government in the case the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victims dignity and privacy usc § a  “in any court proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded” these rights  id at § b  if however “the court finds that the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the crime victims the rights described in subsection a the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to this chapter that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings”  id at § dpursuant to the mechanism set forth in the cvra the crime victim the crime victims lawful representative and the government “may assert the rights described in § a ”  id at § d   these rights must first be “asserted in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or if no prosecution is underway in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred”  id at § d   the district court “shall take up and decide any motion asserting a victims right forthwith”  id if the court denies relief “the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus”  id the court of appeals shall in turn “take up and decide” the petition “within  hours after the petition has been filed”  id this court has often characterized a writ of mandamus as an “extraordinary remedy”  united states v coppa in re united states  fd   d cir   ordinarily this court grants mandamus relief when the district court has usurped power or clearly abused its discretion   see bulow v bulow in re von bulow  fd   d cir stating that the “touchstones” for exercise of mandamus are a showing of “usurpation of power clear abuse of discretion and the presence of an issue of first impression”   accordingly “ ‘mere error even gross error in a particular case as distinguished from a calculated and repeated disregard of governing rules does not suffice to support issuance of the writ’ ”  in re “agent orange” product liability litigation  fd   d cir quoting united states v distefano  fd   d cir   pursuant to this standard the petitioner must usually demonstrate   the presence of a novel and significant question of law   the inadequacy of other available remedies  and  the presence of a legal issue whose resolution will aid in the administration of justice  coppa  fd at   in re united states  fd   d cirunder the plain language of the cvra however congress has chosen a petition for mandamus as a mechanism by which a crime victim may appeal a district courts decision denying relief sought under the provisions of the cvra see  usc § d “the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus”  § db “a victim may make a motion to reopen a plea or sentence only if ․ the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within  days ․”  it is clear therefore that a petitioner seeking relief pursuant to the mandamus provision set forth in § d need not overcome the hurdles typically faced by a petitioner seeking review of a district court determination through a writ of mandamusbecause crime victims as petitioners for mandamus have a right to appellate review we must determine the appropriate standard of that review  “for purposes of standard of review decisions by judges are traditionally divided into three categories denominated questions of law reviewable de novo  questions of fact reviewable for clear error and matters of discretion reviewable for ‘abuse of discretion’”  pierce v underwood  us    sct   ledd     in pierce the supreme court determined that a district courts decision concerning an attorneysfees provision of the equal access to justice act was entitled to abuse of discretion review because   the language of the statute emphasized that the determination to award attorneys fees was one for the district court to make   the district court was better positioned than the court of appeals to decide the issue in question as it may have had “insights not conveyed by the record”  and  the problem was nonamenable to regulation by rule because of the “diffuseness of circumstances novelty vagueness or similar reasons”  id at   sct  similarly the cvra provides that the determination to “ensure” that the crime victim is afforded the rights enumerated in the cvra is entrusted to the district court to make   see  usc § b  further the district court is in a better position than this court to decide whether or not relief is warranted under the cvraand whether the settlement agreement is appropriateas it has far more insight into the complexities of a pending litigation than does a court of appeals   most of the rights provided to crime victims under the cvra require an assessment of “reasonableness”    usc § a    and    the district court is far better positioned to make these assessments and to determine what constitutes “a reasonable procedure” for effecting these rights  usc § d than a court of appealsthe supreme court has noted that “neither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition exists” to determine which standard of review to apply under the equal access to justice act pierce  us at   sct    the same observation applies to the cvra because the factors that warranted application of the abuse of discretion standard of review for the equal access to justice act apply with equal force to the cvra we hold that a district courts determination under the cvra should be reviewed for abuse of discretioniii discussiona the right to restitutionthe principal argument made by both sets of petitioners is that the settlement agreement by requiring releases of third parties unfairly compromises the right of crime victims to receive full restitution   specifically the petitioners contend that  the  million victim fund that will be made available to victims will not have the capacity to provide full restitution to the many victims of the rigases crimes  and  paragraph  of the settlement agreement which releases members of the rigas family except for john j and timothy j rigas from liability and indemnifies them from judgments against third parties also jeopardizes the victims ability to obtain full restitution from parties who might be found jointly and severally liable with the rigases petitioners assert that § a entitles them to “full and timely restitution” omitting to mention however that such restitution must be “as provided in law”   see  usc § a   this important modifier makes it clear that congress recognized that there would be numerous situations when it would be impossible for multiple crime victims of the same set of crimes to be repaid every dollar they had lost   the question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion by approving the settlement agreement given its obligation under the cvra to ensure that the victims are afforded rights to restitution as provided by law   we hold that the district court did notunder the mvra victims of any offense against property under title  including any offense committed by fraud or deceit are not entitled to mandatory restitution if the district court determines that “the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable” or that “determining complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victims losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process”   usc § ac   thus the mvra provides that under these two circumstances victims are not entitled to mandatory restitution   the district court determined that the victims in this case were numerous and that the complexity of resolving a multitude of factual and causal issues would extend the sentencing process inordinately   as a basic predicate to this complexity it is undisputed that there are potentially tens of thousands of victims of the rigases crimes   second the amount of losses of those victims has not been established and doing so would indisputably take a great deal of time   clearly this case fits within the dual exceptions contained in the mvra and the district court did not abuse its discretion by deciding to accept the provisions of the settlement agreement as reasonable substitute restitution as permitted by the mvra further the cvra does not grant victims any rights against individuals who have not been convicted of a crime   concomitantly neither the government nor the sentencing court are restricted by the cvra from effecting reasonable settlement or restitution measures against nonconvicted defendants   to the extent that the government recognizes that victims would have difficulty in effecting any recoveries from the rigas family members because of difficulties in proof of culpability and because of security interests affecting the familys assets petitioners cannot meet their burden in showing that the government or the district court acted unreasonably in entering the settlement agreement or approving it   additionally the district court in no way treated the victims unfairly or without “respect for their dignity and privacy”  usc § a but rather took into consideration the numerosity of victims the uncertainty of recovery and the prospect of unduly prolonging the sentencing proceedings when adopting the settlement factors which congress has required the court to consider   see  usc § db other rights asserted by petitionerspetitioners other arguments unrelated specifically to restitution come in a variety of forms   they assert variously that some victims were denied rights to confer with the attorney for the government  that the manner of obtaining forfeited assets as part of the victims fund violates regulations regarding sharing of forfeited assets with those who committed the crimes at issue  and that they did not get notice of certain aspects of the various settlement agreements in the other court forums that made up the entire interconnected plan for ensuring that  million is available for distribution to the victims   as to each of these arguments they are either without factual support or a legal basis or they were implicitly considered in an appropriate fashion by the district court in its extensive successful efforts to provide notice of the proposed settlement and to solicit and hear objections to it first no petitioner has alleged that it asked the government to confer with it and was denied the opportunity to do so   nothing in the cvra requires the government to seek approval from crime victims before negotiating or entering into a settlement agreement   the cvra requires only that the court provide victims with an opportunity to be heard concerning a proposed settlement agreement and the court provided the victims with a full opportunity to do so in this case   second the district court did not abuse its discretion by approving a settlement that would send funds to adelphia because the government may by statute compromise claims in the context of a forfeiture   see  usc § i   finally the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that given the time delays and the difficulty of identifying victims and calculating losses the government gave reasonable notice to crime victims in the extensive alternative notice procedures it employediv conclusionfor the foregoing reasons we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the settlement agreement at issue and deny the petitions for mandamusfootnotes   these individuals are doris rigas michael j rigas james p
