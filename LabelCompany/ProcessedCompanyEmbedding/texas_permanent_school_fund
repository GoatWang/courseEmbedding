overviewthe texas constitution of  set aside half of texas’ remaining public lands to establish a permanent school fund psf to help finance public schools the glo manages  million acres of state land legislators intended for this land to be sold and the proceeds be deposited into the psf deposits to the psf would be an inexhaustible source of revenue because only interest income from the fund could be spent and would be apportioned among the states public schools the texas general land office manages state lands and mineral rights totaling  million acres this includes vast properties in west texas gulf coast beaches and bays and all “submerged” lands  miles out into the gulf of mexico as well as a variety of state agency acreage and timberlands in east texas a primary responsibility of the land office is to lease these lands for the benefit of the permanent school fund an endowment fund established in  for the benefit of texas public school education leasing texas leases are available for a variety of purposes including oil and gas production solar wind and geothermal power agricultural related activities and commercial development surveying the land since the beginning of the land office surveying has been a vital part of what we do  accurately measuring over  miles of boundaries takes a lot of work common sense conservation the glo is committed to conserving and protecting state natural resources by monitoring the use of leased psf land and allowing only recognized prudent practices to occur on those lands land sales instructions for purchasing state owned land state real properties are properties owned by other state agencies if the governor determines a state property to be underutilized the texas general land office may then be called upon to sell that property typically these properties must be sold in a public forum such as an auction sealed bid sale or through a real estate agent direct sales may occur once the property has been offered to the general public the properties listed on the land office website are available for direct purchase all properties are sold differently and reviewed on a casebycase basis purchasing
