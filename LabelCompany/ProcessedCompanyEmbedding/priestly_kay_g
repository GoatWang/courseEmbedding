title director kay g priestlys experience title chief financial officer company kennecott utah copper corporation job details at kennecott we are committed to researching and implementing additional ways of increasing power supply and energy efficiency throughout our operations the new million megawatt mw combined heat and power chp system that we commissioned in december  at our refinery is an excellent example of this commitment the chp system is more than  percent energy efficient compared to separate heat and power systems which are estimated to be less than  percent efficient the mw chp system produces enough electricity to power  averagesized homes chp also known as cogeneration is an efficient clean and reliable approach to generating power and thermal energy from a single fuel source the refinery chp system meets the steam requirements of the refinery and provides up to  percent of the electrical needs of the plant the steam produced by waste heat from this chp system replaces steam that was previously supplied by a natural gas boiler system it increases the facilitys operational efficiency and decreases energy costs at the same time chp reduces the emission of greenhouse gases which contribute to global climate change chp technology represents an innovative approach to energy planning because the electrical power is being generated onsite rather than at an offsite power plant  an approach called distributed generation the chp system uses a naturalgasfired turbine generator combined with a heatrecovery steam boiler to capture heat from hot turbine exhaust for the efficient production of process steam used at the refinery in addition to powering  percent of the plants electrical needs the chp system reduces air emissions by more than  percent we will soon install a similar mw chp unit at our new molybdenum autoclave processing map facility in  bringing the chp investment to  million with the addition of the refinery chp our power supply from alternative and highefficiency power sources is now at  percent when the map chp comes online in  our power supply from alternative highefficiency power sources will be at  percent title director
