network technologies catalysts on the horizon  network technologies inc nysemktntip  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»network technologies catalysts on the horizonfeb  about network technologies ntip jeff marston contrarian eventdriven valuesummarynetwork has a strong balance sheet and a record of consistent profitabilitydespite a recent runup the valuation is still compellingpossible catalysts are visible on the horizon network ceo and chairman corey m horowitz several eventdriven catalysts seem to be emerging on the horizon for network technologies inc nysemktntip this article will describe these possible catalysts and evaluate the merits of an investment in this microcap intellectual property firm first lets take a look at the fundamentals despite the lofty valuations of most us stocks these days network technologies is one company that is profitable growing debt free and trading at a pe under  here are some other basic metrics market cap m cash and cash equivalents m pricebook  pricesales  pricecash flow  forward dividend yield  debt  ttm roe  insider ownership  interested network develops licenses and protects intellectual property assets put another way network is in the business of acquiring highquality patents on cutting edge inventions and then monetizing them by selling usage licenses since network owns technology patents their licensees are often wellknown tech companies such as apple nasdaqaapl google nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl and cisco nasdaqcsco the interesting part is that historically most or all of networks licensees have been unwilling customers this is where the protect part of the firms mission statement comes in as a bulk of the operating expenses consist of legal consulting fees essentially networks ceo and chairman corey m horowitz has developed a consistent track record of dragging fortune  tech companies into court and extracting multimilliondollar licensing deals from them if this business model sounds unscrupulous at first glance consider that network actually is supporting technological innovation which makes the world a better place by providing inventors with a credible way to monetize their ideas in the fiercely competitive ip industry network isnt the biggest in terms of financial resources or staff but unlike most of its competitors the firm has reported a solid profit almost every quarter for the past six years a brief overview of the competition will demonstrate just how tough the ip industry is rpx corporation nasdaqrpxc market cap m eps has declined for four years straight mostly due to equity dilution acacia research corporation nasdaqactg market cap m about to post its fourth straight year of negative earnings wilan inc nasdaqwiln market cap m earnings are spotty roe hasnt been above  since  virnetx holdings corp nysemktvhc market cap m book value per share is in free fall from  per share in  to  per share today marathon patent group inc nasdaqmara market cap m negative free cash flow every year since the  ipo to be fair i have not done a deep dive on any of the companies listed above and some of them may be sound investments however after a cursory review of their financial statements i am happy to pass on all of them looking at the weak fundamentals of the competition one might be inclined to forego investing in the ip industry altogether on the other hand network stands out as an outlier and a consistent performer in this industry with that overview out of the way lets have a look at whats been happening with network lately over the past year the stock has almost doubled the  capital gain has coincided with two blowout quarters in both q and q in q  network set alltime records in almost every operating metric and yearoveryear operating income growth for the quarter was  at this point savvy sa readers will start to wonder whether the recent performance is sustainable no matter how impressive past performance is only useful to the extent that it may hold clues to what the future may hold network is a relatively easy company to understand because the firm owns four main assets with revenue generating potential these intangible assets are portfolios of patents known as  mirror worlds  remote power  cox and  qos a detailed description of each of these assets can be found at networks website i will discuss each of these four assets and their monetization potential the chart below provides a quick snapshot of what follows asset total revenue recognized as of  sep  future royalties due litigation pending mirror worlds m no no remote power m yes yes cox  no yes qos  no no mirror worlds patent portfolio what really made q  such a huge success was a onetime licensing settlement of m with apple inc that was related to the mirror worlds patent under the terms of the july  settlement apple paid m for permission to use one of the patents in the mirror worlds portfolio until the expiration of the patent the kicker is that the patent actually expired in june  so the payment was more of a penalty for past use than anything else and network will receive no future royalties relating to this settlement with apple this is a significant point since this m made up over twothirds of the recordbreaking m of revenue in q that coincided with the big jump in networks share price the settlement with apple was the result of litigation that network initiated in may  when apple was one of eight firms that network sued for licensing royalties of the remaining seven microsoft nasdaqmsft settled in november  for a onetime payment of m and the courts dismissed networks claims against the other six firms on the basis that they were actually just customers of microsoft essentially microsoft paid out on behalf of the other defendants in addition network received a lump sum payment of m in april  for a professional liability settlement related to services rendered in  network didnt initiate this claim but took it over when the firm acquired the mirror worlds portfolio in may  in the end we can see that network recognized around m in revenue from the mirror worlds litigation  from microsoft and m from apple and another m for the liability settlement related to mirror worlds for a total return on investment for the mirror worlds patent of around m however no future royalties are due in connection with the mirror worlds patent and the firm has not disclosed any plans to initiate new litigation connected to this asset it would seem that the mirror worlds portfolio has been squeezed for as much revenue as we should expect at least for the foreseeable future remote power patent portfolio investors who are familiar with network will already know that the firms real cash cow is its remote power patent with a total return of over m in revenue to date this asset has been the biggest contributor to networks earnings by far  total firms still owe network ongoing royalty payments of around mm annually until the expiration of the patent in march  of these  cisco is easily the biggest source of revenue cisco owes network annual payments of roughly m out of the total mm through the life of the patent these royalty payments which are payable on a monthly or quarterly basis are the only source of locked in recurring revenue that network can currently claim which makes modeling an earnings forecast extremely difficult although these recurring revenue numbers are somewhat low even for a firm with a market cap under m we can expect roughly one third of this recurring royalty revenue to translate directly into earnings this is because network has such low operating costs with a sevenyear average gross margin rate of  and a sevenyear average operating margin rate of  the firm achieves these numbers by keeping fixed and recurring costs low including the ceo there are only two fulltime employees the firm leases a few small offices and since almost all the assets are either in cash or intangibles capital expenditures are typically zero i got a taste of this bare bones efficiency in action when i called the investor relations department recently and ended up talking directly to ceo and chairman corey m horowitz in addition to the mm in recurring royalty revenues that we can expect from the remote power asset through march  litigation related to this patent portfolio is still pending and investors should expect future revenuegenerating settlements related to this litigation network initiated this legislation with  defendant tech firms in september  and as of this writing only  of the  have settled with network of note the courts have consistently ruled in networks favor in this litigation so the writing is probably on the wall for the remaining four holdouts so what can we expect from the future settlements with these firms perhaps the recent example of polycom inc nasdaqplcm can offer some insight polycom capitulated in october  and agreed to pay a onetime license initiation fee of m for past use in addition to ongoing royalties m of the license initiation fee was paid within  days of settlement and the balance of the remaining m will be paid in three annual installments of m beginning in october  in other words the polycom settlement did not impact q since the reporting period ended on  sep  so we can expect roughly m of new settlement revenue to be recognized related to the remote power asset in the upcoming quarter the remaining four firms that have yet to settle are avaya inc private axis communications inc otcaxcty juniper networks inc nysejnpr and hewlett packard enterprise nysehpe estimating future payouts from these firms is difficult but if we look at past settlements an interesting trend emerges there appears to be a rough correlation between the size of defendant firms and the amounts they end up paying out in licensing royalties this makes sense when we consider that the defendant firms generate their own revenues by selling products that use the patented technology that network rightfully owns therefore large firms with higher sales volumes tend to owe more in settlement royalties to network when they finally capitulate because they simply sell more of networks patented technology therefore we can expect that a firm like hewlett packard with annual sales of around b will likely be forced to pay larger settlement royalties the trial for the four remaining firms will convene in march  and it is reasonable to expect settlement payouts toward the end of  further it is entirely possible that these firms will agree to settle before they are forced to do so and indeed a few of the original  defendants decided to settle prior to their trial dates therefore we should expect network to recognize at least some settlement revenue in connection with the remote power litigation during networks upcoming fiscal year cox patent portfolio the cox portfolio is a wild card since to date this asset has not generated any revenue however i believe this asset has untapped potential and it is actually what convinced me to buy networks stock network acquired its first patents in this portfolio in february  and initiated its first litigation related to this asset in  the case is progressing nicely and in october  the patent trial and appeal board ptab ruled in favor of network against defendants google and youtube the case is currently in a stay of proceedings status if the defendants choose not to settle i expect the case to go to trial sometime in  network has already demonstrated a consistent ability to extract licensing revenues from whales such as apple and cisco so a large settlement with google seems increasingly likely investors who are not keen on waiting up to two years for this possible catalyst should take some comfort in the fact that network has a forward dividend yield of  so they will at least be paid a small stipend for their patience qos patent portfolio this relatively new patent portfolio is another wild card as it has not generated any revenue to date and network has not disclosed any intention of initiating legislation in connection with this asset downside risks in general investing in microcaps is risky this becomes especially true when the microcap in question operates in a fiercely competitive industry that lacks a reliable mechanism for forecasting earnings with anything resembling precision in addition in the case of network there are some specific risks that investors should be aware of first the only asset on networks balance sheet that is currently generating revenue is a patent portfolio remote power that is subject to ongoing legal challenges it is possible that the courts will determine that this patent portfolio is invalid and immediately deny network its only consistent cash flow stream whenever network files patent lawsuits the defendant tech firms inevitably file counter suits seeking to completely invalidate the underlying patent in the case this is certainly the case with both the current litigation related to the remote power portfolio and the cox portfolio wherein the defendants have indeed filed counter claims however a scenario where networks patents are deemed invalid seems unlikely since remote power has withstood legal scrutiny for over  years and the ptab just ruled in networks favor in the case of the cox portfolio second it is possible that network could still fail in its litigation versus the remaining four defendants in the remote power case it is possible that the reason why the final four defendants including hewlett packard have been able to hold out since network filed suit in  is because one or more of them actually has a viable defense third it is possible that network will fail in its litigation versus google and youtube in the ongoing litigation connected to the cox patent portfolio although the cox litigation has great potential we are still in the early phases of this case the recent favorable ptab ruling is a positive sign but we shouldnt expect a megacap tech company like google to go down without a fight if network fails to protect either its remote power or cox patents in court these events would likely create downward pressure on the stock finally it is important to note that all the patents contained in networks four portfolios have expiration dates and all of them will expire within approximately five years some will expire much sooner than that network will need to acquire new revenuegenerating patents to replace the patent portfolios currently on the balance sheet if network fails to do this their future profitability will be in jeopardy conclusion im cautiously optimistic regarding networks ability to reach favorable settlements connected to either the remote power portfolio the cox portfolio or both i believe it is possible that one or more of these cases will result in a sizable settlement due to these possible catalysts on the horizon i believe network investors stand a reasonable chance of achieving a satisfactory capital gain over a one to threeyear holding period supporting documents txedcepdf disclosure i amwe are
