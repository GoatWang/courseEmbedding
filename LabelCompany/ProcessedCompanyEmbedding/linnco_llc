to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm

contact us login search search was linnco llcs exchange offer really a success the beleaguered holding company continues to seek solutions to its parent company’s mammoth debt problem matthew dilallo tmfmd apr   at pm   image source linn energy llc  linnco nasdaqlnco announced today that it had successfully completed its exchange offer for units of its parent company linn energy nasdaqline its a move both entities are making in order to potentially save linn energy holders from a big tax hit if the company undergoes a major debt restructuring however linnco noted that just  of the total number of linn energys outstanding units were tendered and accepted that low acceptance rate as well as a followon offering period suggests that the offer wasnt a success at all whats going on about a month ago linnco announced that it was offering to exchange units of linn energy for shares of linnco in a to ratio it was doing so for the following two reasons to permit holders of linn energy units to maintain their economic interest in linn energy through linnco whose only assets are the units it owns of linn energy the exchange would allow linn energy unitholders to avoid future taxable income and loss including cancellation of debt income or codi that could result from a future debt restructuring at linn its that second purpose of the exchange thats most pertinent at the moment because linn energy has a mountain of debt that its attempting to address through restructuring potential restructurings could include debt exchanges such as the ones the company has done in the past which have reduced its net debt by a total of  billion thus far and triggered some codi for unitholders last year it also includes a potential restructuring under chapter  bankruptcy which linn has warned could trigger substantial codi for unitholders in the investor presentation that the company put together for the initial exchange offering linnco provided the following potential codi allocations to each outstanding linn energy unit based on the debt forgiven if linn energy restructures  billion in debt then  per unit in codi would be allocated to each outstanding linn unit if  billion in debt were restructured  per unit in codi would be allocated at  billion that number would balloon to  per unit in order to avoid this potentially big tax hit investors could swap their linn energy units for linnco shares and because linnco is a c corp its investors wouldnt have this tax burden passed through to them   whats next given the increasingly likelihood that linn energy will undergo a major debt restructuring in the near future linnco is now extending its exchange offer for another month to the  of linn energy investors who have yet to tender their units that roughly coincides with the companys looming deadline with creditors which have given it until may  before theyll reduce its borrowing base that said the company doesnt have a whole lot of time to find an alternative debt reduction solution outside of restructuring in chapter  despite that tight deadline the bulk of linns unitholders have yet to agree to the exchange which certainly complicates things for the company while the exchange was offered for the benefit of unitholders the wall street journal did note earlier this year that linn was exploring exchange options because linn hopes helping investors sidestep a tax hit could reduce the chance that they will band together and complicate a potential bankruptcy according to people familiar with the matter with investors not buying into the initial exchange offer it certainly muddies the waters even more for linn which is why linnco is offering another chance to exchange however it seems to be clear that unitholders dont see the benefit of the exchange given the increasingly unlikelihood that theyll get nothing in a chapter   investor takeaway linn energy and linnco are running out of options as they slide ever closer to a chapter  bankruptcy filing which could come as early as next month given the deadline with creditors thats leaving few palpable options for longsuffering investors who might not be left with any salvageable value matt dilallo

to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm
