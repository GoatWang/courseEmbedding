was intended to spur development of advanced biofuels derived from nonfood and feed crops viewdownload this article in pdf format the biomass crop assistance program bcap a new program added to the energy title in the  farm bill was intended to spur development of advanced biofuels derived from nonfood and feed crops the goal was to pay individuals and companies to plant perennial grasses harvest agricultural residues collect wood waste store biomass and transport these materials to bioenergy facilities however due to several implementation problems the existence of program loopholes and technological and economic issues with the production of cellulosic biofuels derived from the aforementioned crops bcap has faced serious questions from policymakers and its funding has been cut in annual federal spending bills for these reasons in the  farm bill bcap was authorized to spend an unlimited amount of taxpayer funding from fy however congress limited funding in latter years due to several implementation issues the  farm bill expired sept   but a oneyear retroactive extension passed as part of the jan  “fiscal cliff” deal allowed bcap to receive optional discretionary funding through september   the end of fy the  farm bill enacted in february provided  million of mandatory funding from fy background bcap is funded though the energy title of the farm bill the farm bill renewed approximately every five years is a wide ranging piece of legislation that funds everything from nutrition assistance programs and broadband internet to agricultural subsidies for the production of crops such as corn and soybeans more specifically the energy title of the farm bill first introduced in  provides grants loans and other subsidies to energy efficiency biofuels and bioenergy heat and power projects in total the  farm bill energy title’s  major programs were projected to cost taxpayers  billion over five years fy  subsidies provided through the energy title go to facilities ranging from universities receiving research and development grants to investigate new uses for biomass sources such as wood and agricultural residues to large established corn ethanol companies receiving grants for annual production of biofuel other energy title projects funded by taxpayers include the collection storage harvest and transportation of biomass sources to bioenergy or biofuels facilities namely through bcap anaerobic digesters that create heat and power from animal waste grants and loans to individuals or companies installing ethanol dispensers at gasoline stations or wind solar and geothermal systems and federally backed loan guarantees for socalled next generation biofuels facilities that produce biofuels other than corn ethanol while intended to support the next generation of biofuels derived from nonfood sources and other renewable forms of energy the farm bill energy title has also spent taxpayer dollars on the mature corn ethanol industry supporting biomass sources with numerous unintended consequences and even paying for updates to farmers’ irrigation equipment and grain dryers funding challenges due to glaring program loopholes initially the us department of agriculture’s farm service agency only implemented the portion of bcap which paid up to  per ton to collect harvest store or transport biomass materials called chst matching payments  it wasn’t until recently that project areas have been approved to pay farmers or landowners to plant perennial grasses and fastgrowing trees to transport to facilities that convert crops to fuel or heatpower bcap was projected to cost  million over five years but since congress initially allowed a blank check to be written each year from taxpayers the program checked in at nearly  million over budget just in   worse yet bcap failed to incentivize the types of projects its proponents fought for just two years earlier planting of grasses and trees instead large pulp and paper companies collected nearly all of the taxpayer subsidies by taking advantage of a glaring loophole loggers and truckers also pocketed collection and transportation payments by conducting business that they would have been engaged in regardless of bcap payments with pressure from congress and usda’s own office of inspector general the government halted the matching payment program limited bcap expenditures to  million in fy and is now only paying farmers to actually plant feedstocks for socalled “next generation” biofuels  the  farm bill reauthorized chst payments at  per ton for a maximum of two years and provides that funding shall be available for technical assistance types of feedstocks receiving taxpayer funding the types of crops eligible for bcap crop establishment subsidies as of  are summarized in table  by project area  chst subsidies on the other hand can be made to entities in any state but usda announced eligible facilities in july  see table  for a description of facilities their locations and feedstocks about twothirds of the  approved project establishment areas will grow various perennial grasses including miscanthus a tall perennial grass used to produce cellulosic ethanol the remaining four project areas will produce either camelina an oilseed crop for use in biodiesel production or woody biomass like poplar and willow trees for use in heating power or cellulosic ethanol facilities as of the  farm bill crop residue from crops that receive farm commodity payments are also eligible but not the crop itself for example corn stalks and cobs are eligible for bcap payments but not corn for use in ethanol in addition woody biomass collected or harvested directly from the national forest system bureau of land management land nonfederal land tribal lands as long as a conservation plan is in place or as a result of certain preventative treatments is also now eligible for taxpayer subsidies crops or other forms of biomass ineligible for payments include invasive and noxious plants manure and animal byproducts municipal solid waste bagasse and algae table   approved feedstocks for biomass crop assistance program funding types of feedstocks number of projects states with approved project areas perennial grasses and miscanthus  arkansas kansas missouri north carolina ohio oklahoma and pennsylvania camelina  california montana oregon and washington woody biomass  new york and oregon total      as table  shows most of the bcap subsidies available to individuals or companies delivering biomass to eligible facilities are for wood products such as wood waste wood pellets etc  only six of the  facilities eligible for taxpayersubsidized biomass deliveries utilize other biomass sources such as agricultural residues corn stover nursery crop residue potato residues etc municipal waste bioenergy crops or other sources as the funding information demonstrates most taxpayer subsidies are still being directed toward the mature wood products industry not second generation biofuels derived from bioenergy crops such as switchgrass or agricultural residues despite restrictions placed on bcap over the past five years taxpayer subsidies are still failing to fulfill their intended goals   table  facilities eligible for collection harvest storage  transportation payments in the biomass crop assistance program july

products conclusion the biomass crop assistance program has faced several implementation challenges since its introduction in the  farm bill bcap has failed to meet its stated goals of spurring production of nextgeneration bioenergy and biofuels crops and instead has come in significantly over budget while funneling taxpayer dollars to large pulp and paper companies for business activities that they would have engaged in anyway both congress and usda’s own inspector general have highlighted shortcomings of the program questions from independent sources such as the national research council have also arisen about the feasibility of secondgeneration biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol produced from bcapsubsidized feedstocks including perennial grasses and woody biomass for these reasons bcap should not be renewed in the next farm bill and spending should be reined in until then for more information contact taxpayers for common sense at  filed under avoid unnecessary

the threat of fires by removing dead or diseased trees from public forest lands and invests in rural businesses and new energy markets said vilsack the fires we are seeing right now in the west
