willing to challenge some of the ways in which that faith had become conventional or inwardlooking it is not too much to say that he helped to change the face of evangelicalism internationally arguing for the necessity of holistic mission that applied the gospel of jesus to every area of life including social and political questions but he will be remembered most warmly as an expositor of scripture and a teacher of the faith whose depth and simplicity brought doctrine alive in all sorts of new ways rowan williams archbishop of canterbury stotts funeral was on  august  at all souls church it was

the ethics and public policy center as saying that if evangelicals could elect a pope stott is the person they would likely choose writingedit he wrote over  books some of which appear only in chinese korean or spanish as well as many articles and papers one of these is basic christianity isbn  a book which seeks to explain the message of christianity and convince its readers of its truth and importance the preachers portrait some new testament word studies isbn  published in  it was an important reference for clergy he was also the author of the cross of christ isbn  of which j i packer stated no other treatment of this supreme subject says so much so truly and so wellcitation needed other books he wrote include essentials a dialogue with the liberal cleric and theologian david l edwards over whether what evangelicals hold as essential should be seen as such in  he produced evangelical truth which summarises what he perceives as being the central claims of christianity essential for evangelicalism upon his formal retirement from public engagements he continued to engage in regular writing until his death in  he produced the anglican evangelical doctrine of infant baptism with j alec motyer an introduction to his thought can be found in his two final substantial publications which act as a summation of his thinking both were published by the publishing house

explicitly be his final book the radical disciple it concludes with a poignant farewell and appeal for his legacy to be continued through the work of the langham partnership international anglican evangelicalismedit stott played a key role as a leader of evangelicalism within the church of england and was regarded as instrumental in persuading evangelicals to play an active role in the church of england rather than leaving for exclusively evangelical denominations there were two major events where he played a key role in this regard he was chairing the national assembly of evangelicals in  a convention organised by the evangelical alliance when martyn lloydjones made an unexpected call for evangelicals to unite together as evangelicals and no longer within their mixed denominations this view was motivated by a belief that true christian fellowship requires evangelical views on central topics such as the atonement and the inspiration of scripture lloydjones was a key figure to many in the free churches and evangelical anglicans regarded stott similarly the two leaders publicly disagreed as stott though not scheduled as a speaker that evening used his role as chairman to refute lloydjones saying that his opinion went against history and the bible the following year saw the first national evangelical anglican congress which was held at keele university at this conference largely due to stotts influence evangelical anglicans committed themselves to full participation in the church of england rejecting the separationist approach proposed by lloydjones these two conferences effectively fixed the direction of a large part of the british evangelical community although there is an ongoing debate as to the exact nature of lloydjoness views they undoubtedly caused the two groupings to adopt diametrically opposed positions these positions and the resulting split continue largely unchanged to this day honoursedit stott was appointed a chaplain to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom in  and on his retirement in  an extra chaplain he was appointed a commander of the order of the british empire cbe in the new year honours  he received a number of honorary doctorates as well as a lambeth doctorate of divinity controversyedit stott publicly espoused the idea of annihilationism which is the belief that hell is incineration into nonexistence rather than everlasting conscious torment the traditional evangelical approach he was not dogmatic about this position but held to it somewhat tentatively insisting only that it be accepted as a legitimate evangelical option the ultimate annihilation of the wicked should at least be accepted as a legitimate biblically founded alternative to their eternal conscious torment this led to a heated debate within mainstream evangelical christianity some writers criticised stott in very strong terms while others supported his views stott also supported the ordination of women deacons and presbyters although he did not believe they should be in positions of headship antizionismedit stott stated his firm opposition to zionism political zionism and christian zionism are anathema to christian faith  the true israel today is neither jews nor israelis but believers in the messiah even if they are gentiles  personal lifeedit stott remained celibate his entire life he said the gift of singleness is more a vocation than an empowerment although to be sure god is faithful in supporting those he calls stotts favourite relaxation was birdwatching his book the birds our teachers draws on this interest

him whether in person or through his many books he was a man of rare graciousness and deep personal kindness a superb communicator and a sensitive and skilled counsellor without ever compromising his firm evangelical faith he showed himself willing to challenge some of the ways in which that faith had become conventional or inwardlooking it is not too much to say that he helped to change the face of evangelicalism internationally arguing for the necessity of holistic mission that applied the gospel of jesus to every area of life including social and political questions but he will be remembered most warmly as an expositor of scripture and a teacher of the faith whose depth and simplicity brought doctrine alive in all sorts of new ways rowan williams archbishop of canterbury stotts

york times columnist david brooks cited michael cromartie of the ethics and public policy center as saying that if evangelicals could elect a pope stott is the person they would likely choose writingedit he wrote over  books some of which appear only in chinese korean or spanish as well as many articles and papers one of these is basic christianity isbn  a book which seeks to explain the message of christianity and convince its readers of its truth and importance the preachers portrait some new testament word studies isbn  published in  it was an important reference for clergy he was also the author of the cross of christ isbn  of which j i packer stated no other treatment of this supreme subject says so much so truly and so wellcitation needed other books he wrote include essentials a dialogue with the liberal cleric and theologian david l edwards over whether what evangelicals hold as essential should be seen as such in  he produced evangelical truth which summarises what he perceives as being the central claims of christianity essential for evangelicalism upon his formal retirement from public engagements he continued to engage in regular writing until his death in  he produced the anglican evangelical doctrine of infant baptism with j alec motyer an introduction to his thought can be found in his two final substantial publications which act as a summation of

in january  at the age of  he saw the launch of what would explicitly be his final book the radical disciple it concludes with a poignant farewell and appeal for his legacy to be continued through the work of the langham partnership international anglican evangelicalismedit stott played a key role as a leader of evangelicalism within the church of england and was regarded as instrumental in persuading evangelicals to play an active role in the church of england rather than leaving for exclusively evangelical denominations there were two major events where he played a key role in this regard he was chairing the national assembly of evangelicals in  a convention organised by the evangelical alliance when martyn lloydjones made an unexpected call for evangelicals to unite together as evangelicals and no longer within their mixed denominations this view was motivated by a belief that true christian fellowship requires evangelical views on central topics such as the atonement and the inspiration of scripture lloydjones was a key figure to many in the free churches and evangelical anglicans regarded stott similarly the two leaders publicly disagreed as stott though not scheduled as a speaker that evening used his role as chairman to refute lloydjones saying that his opinion went against history and the bible the following year saw the first national evangelical anglican congress which was held at keele university at this conference largely due to stotts influence evangelical anglicans committed themselves to full participation in the church of england rejecting the separationist approach proposed by lloydjones these two conferences effectively fixed the direction of a large part of the british evangelical community although there is an ongoing debate as to the exact nature of lloydjoness views they undoubtedly caused the two groupings to adopt diametrically opposed positions these positions and the resulting split continue largely unchanged to this day honoursedit stott was appointed a chaplain to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom in  and on his retirement in  an extra chaplain he was appointed a commander of the order of the british empire cbe in the new year honours  he received a number of honorary doctorates as well as a lambeth doctorate of divinity controversyedit stott publicly espoused the idea of annihilationism which is the belief that hell is incineration into nonexistence rather than everlasting conscious torment the traditional evangelical approach he was not dogmatic about this position but held to it somewhat tentatively insisting only that it be accepted as a legitimate evangelical option the ultimate annihilation of the wicked should at least be accepted as a legitimate biblically founded alternative to their eternal conscious torment this led to a heated debate within mainstream evangelical christianity some writers criticised stott in very strong terms while others supported his views stott also supported the ordination of women deacons and presbyters although he did not believe they should be in positions of headship antizionismedit stott stated his firm opposition to zionism political zionism and christian zionism are anathema to christian faith  the true israel today is neither jews nor israelis but believers in the messiah even if they are gentiles  personal lifeedit stott remained celibate his entire life he said the gift of singleness is more a vocation than an empowerment although to be sure god is faithful in supporting those he calls stotts favourite relaxation was

my bible had high ideals and tried to be good and do good but all the time often without realising it i was holding christ at arms length and keeping him outside i knew that to open the door might have momentous consequences i am profoundly grateful to him for enabling me to open the door looking back now over more than fifty years i realise that that simple step has changed the entire direction course and quality of my life stott was mentored by nash who wrote a weekly letter to him advising him on how to develop and grow in his christian life as well as practicalities such as

him whether in person or through his many books he was a man of rare graciousness and deep personal kindness a superb communicator and a sensitive and skilled counsellor without ever compromising his firm evangelical faith he showed himself willing to challenge some of the ways in which that faith had become conventional or inwardlooking it is not too much to say that he helped to change the face of evangelicalism internationally arguing for the necessity of holistic mission that applied the gospel of jesus to every area of life including social and political questions but he will be remembered most warmly as an expositor of scripture and a teacher of the faith whose depth and simplicity brought doctrine alive in all sorts of new ways rowan williams archbishop of canterbury stotts

his death he was cremated his ashes were interred at dale cemetery in pembrokeshire wales influenceedit stott has had considerable influence in evangelicalism in a november  editorial on stott new york times columnist david brooks cited michael cromartie of the ethics and public policy center as saying that if evangelicals could elect a pope stott is the person they would likely choose writingedit he wrote over  books some of which appear only in chinese korean or spanish as well as many articles and papers one of these is basic christianity isbn  a book which seeks to explain the message of christianity and convince its readers of its truth and importance the preachers portrait some new testament word studies isbn  published in  it was an important reference for clergy he was also the author of the cross of christ isbn  of which j i packer stated no other treatment of this supreme subject says so much so truly and so wellcitation needed other books he wrote include essentials a dialogue with the liberal cleric and theologian david l edwards over whether what evangelicals hold as essential should be seen as such in  he produced evangelical truth which summarises what he perceives as being the central claims of christianity essential for evangelicalism upon his formal retirement from public engagements he continued to engage in regular writing until his death in  he produced the anglican evangelical doctrine of infant baptism with j alec motyer an introduction to his thought can be found in his two final substantial publications which act as a summation of his thinking both were published by the publishing house with which he had a lifelong association ivp in  his reflections on the life of the church the living church convictions of a lifelong pastor in january  at the age of  he saw the launch of what would explicitly be his final book the radical disciple it concludes with a poignant farewell and appeal for his legacy to be continued through the work of the langham partnership international anglican evangelicalismedit stott played a key role as a leader of evangelicalism within the church of england and was regarded as instrumental in persuading evangelicals to play an active role in the church of england rather than leaving for exclusively evangelical denominations there were two major events where he played a key role in this regard he was chairing the national assembly of evangelicals in  a convention organised by the evangelical alliance when martyn lloydjones made an unexpected call for evangelicals to unite together as evangelicals and no longer within their mixed denominations this view was motivated by a belief that true christian fellowship requires evangelical views on central topics such as the atonement and the inspiration of scripture lloydjones was a key figure to many in the free churches and evangelical anglicans regarded stott similarly the two leaders publicly disagreed as stott though not scheduled as a speaker that evening used his role as chairman to refute lloydjones saying that his opinion went against history and the bible the following year saw the first national evangelical anglican congress which was held at keele university at this conference largely due to stotts influence evangelical anglicans committed themselves to full participation in the church of england rejecting the separationist approach proposed by lloydjones these two conferences effectively fixed the direction of a large part of the british evangelical community although there is an ongoing debate as to the exact nature of lloydjoness views they undoubtedly caused the two groupings to adopt diametrically opposed positions these positions and the resulting split continue largely unchanged to this day honoursedit stott was appointed a chaplain to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom in  and on his retirement in  an extra chaplain he was appointed a commander of the order of the british empire cbe in the new year honours  he received a number of honorary doctorates as well as a lambeth doctorate of divinity controversyedit stott publicly espoused the idea of annihilationism which is the belief that hell is incineration into nonexistence rather than everlasting conscious torment the traditional evangelical approach he was not dogmatic about this position but held to it somewhat tentatively insisting only that it be accepted as a legitimate evangelical option the ultimate annihilation of the wicked should at least be accepted as a legitimate biblically founded alternative to their eternal conscious torment this led to a heated debate within mainstream evangelical christianity some writers criticised stott in very strong terms while others supported his views stott also supported the ordination of women deacons and presbyters although he did not believe they should be in positions of headship antizionismedit stott stated his firm opposition to zionism political zionism and christian zionism are anathema to christian faith  the true israel today is neither jews nor israelis but believers in the messiah even if they are gentiles  personal lifeedit stott remained celibate his entire life he said the gift of singleness is more a vocation than an empowerment although to be sure god is faithful in supporting those he calls stotts favourite relaxation was
