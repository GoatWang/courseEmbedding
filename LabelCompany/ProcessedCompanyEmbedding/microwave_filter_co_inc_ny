electronic filters both for radio and microwave frequencies to help process signal distribution and to prevent unwanted signals from disrupting transmit or receive operations markets served include cable television television and radio broadcast satellite broadcast mobile radio commercial communications and defense electronics   critical accounting policies   the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently applied valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis throughout the company primary areas where financial information of the company is subject to the use of estimates assumptions and the application of judgment include revenues receivables inventories warranty reserves and taxes note  to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company   revenues from product sales are recorded as the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that no significant vendor or postcontract support obligations remain and the collection of the related receivable is probable billings in advance of the company’s performance of such work are reflected as customer deposits in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet   allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances   the company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on the firstin firstout method or market the company uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand and changes in technology to provide for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory   the company established a warranty reserve which provides for the estimated cost of product returns based upon historical experience and any known conditions or circumstances the warranty obligation is affected by product that does not meet specifications and performance requirements and any related costs of addressing such matters product must be returned within one year of the date of purchase          the company accounts for income taxes under fasb asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which are anticipated to be in effect when these differences reverse the deferred tax provision is the result of the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets   results of operations   three months ended march   vs three months ended march     the following table sets forth the company’s net sales by major

decrease of  or  when compared to net sales of  for the three months ended march   the decrease in sales can primarily be attributed to decreases in the company’s cable tv and satellite product sales   mfc’s cable tv product sales decreased  or  to  for the three months ended march   when compared to cable tv product sales of  during the same period last year the decrease in sales can primarily be attributed to orders from two customers with specific cable applications last year management continues to project flat or a decrease in demand for standard cable tv products due to the shift from analog to digital television due to the inherent nature of digital modulation versus analog modulation fewer filters are required the company has developed filters for digital television and there will still be requirements for analog filters for limited applications in commercial and private cable systems   mfc’s satellite product sales decreased  or  to  for the three months ended march   when compared to satellite product sales of  during the same period last year the decrease in sales can be attributed to a decrease in demand for the company’s filters which suppress strong outofband interference caused by military and civilian radar systems and other sources although economic conditions do impact sales management expects demand for these types of filters to continue with the proliferation of earth stations worldwide and increased sources of interference          mfc’s rfmicrowave product sales increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   when compared to rfmicrowave product sales of  during the same period last year the company’s rfmicrowave products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers that serve the mobile radio commercial communications and defense electronics markets sales to one oem customer increased  to  or approximately  of total sales for the three months ended march   compared to sales of  or approximately  of total sales for the three months ended march   these sales are in connection with a multiyear program in which the company is a subcontractor the company continues to invest in production engineering and infrastructure development to penetrate oem market segments as they become popular mfc is concentrating its technical resources and product development efforts toward potential high volume customers as part of a concentrated effort to provide substantial longterm growth over the last year mfc in conjunction with various oem’s has developed and supplied prototypes as well as small production runs in support of new programs being introduced to the marketplace it is our belief that a continuation of this effort will help increase sales as well as reinforcing mfc’s position as a quality manufacturer of rf filters and assemblies   mfc’s broadcast tvwireless cable product sales decreased  or  to  for the three months ended march   when compared to sales of  during the same period last year   mfc’s sales order backlog equaled  at march   compared to sales order backlog of  at march   however backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is representative of actual sales for any succeeding period approximately  of the total sales order backlog at march   is scheduled to ship by september     gross profit for the three months ended march   equaled  a decrease of  or  when compared to gross profit of  for the three months ended march   the decrease in gross profit can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year as a percentage of sales gross profit equaled  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year providing a lower base to absorb overhead expenses   selling general and administrative sga expenses for the three months ended march   equaled  a decrease of  or  when compared to sga expenses of  for the three months ended march   the decrease can primarily be attributed to decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses the company has been participating in the new york state shared work program which allows employers to reduce the hours of all or a particular group of employees the employees whose hours are reduced can receive partial unemployment insurance benefits or elect to use accrued vacation as a percentage of sales sga expenses increased to  for the three months ended march   when compared to  for the three months ended march   primarily due to the lower sales volume this year providing a lower base to absorb expenses   the company recorded a loss from operations of  for the three months ended march   compared to income from operations of  for the three months ended march   the decrease in operating income can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year          other expense was  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   primarily due to interest expense of  offset by miscellaneous nonoperating income of  for the three months ended march   and interest expense of  offset by miscellaneous nonoperating income of  for the three months ended march   other income generally consists of interest income sales of scrap material the forfeiture of nonrefundable deposits and other incidental items   the benefit for income taxes equaled  for the three months ended march   and a benefit of  for the three months ended march   the benefit for the three months ended march   can be attributed to a prior year’s federal refund any benefit for losses has been subject to a valuation allowance since the realization of the deferred tax benefit is not considered more likely than not as required by fasb asc  the company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realization of its deferred tax assets the company has determined that at this time it is more likely than not that the company will not realize all of the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and as a result a valuation allowance was established   six

ended march   compared to sales of  or approximately  of total sales for the six months ended march   these sales are in connection with a multiyear program in which the company is a subcontractor the company continues to invest in production engineering and infrastructure development to penetrate oem market segments as they become popular mfc is concentrating its technical resources and product development efforts toward potential high volume customers as part of a concentrated effort to provide substantial longterm growth over the last year mfc in conjunction with various oem’s has developed and supplied prototypes as well as small production runs in support of new programs being introduced to the marketplace it is our belief that a continuation of this effort will help increase sales as well as reinforcing mfc’s position as a quality manufacturer of rf filters and assemblies          mfc’s satellite product sales decreased  or  to  for the six months ended march   when compared to satellite product sales of  during the same period last year the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in demand for the company’s filters which suppress strong outofband interference caused by military and civilian radar systems and other sources although economics conditions impact sales management expects demand for these types of filters to continue with the proliferation of earth stations worldwide and increased sources of interference   mfc’s cable tv product sales decreased  or  to  for the six months ended march   when compared to cable tv product sales of  during the same period last year the decrease in sales can primarily be attributed to orders from two customers with specific cable applications last year management continues to project flat or a decrease in demand for standard cable tv products due to the shift from analog to digital television due to the inherent nature of digital modulation versus analog modulation fewer filters are required the company has developed filters for digital television and there will still be requirements for analog filters for limited applications in commercial and private cable systems   mfc’s broadcast tvwireless cable product sales decreased  or  to  for the six months ended march   when compared to sales of  during the same period last year the decrease can primarily be attributed to a decrease in demand for wireless diplexers which were sold to one customer last year   mfc’s sales order backlog equaled  at march   compared to sales order backlog of  at march   however backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is representative of actual sales for any succeeding period approximately  of the total sales order backlog at march   is scheduled to ship by september     gross profit for the six months ended march   equaled  a decrease of  or  when compared to gross profit of  for the six

equaled  for the six months ended march   compared to  for the six months ended march   the decrease can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year providing a lower base to absorb overhead expenses   sga expenses for the six months ended march   equaled  a decrease of  or  when compared to sga expenses of  for the six months ended march   the decrease can primarily be attributed to decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses the company has been participating in the new york state shared work program which allows employers to reduce the hours of all or a particular group of employees the employees whose hours are reduced can receive partial unemployment insurance benefits or elect to use accrued vacation as a percentage of sales sga expenses increased to  for the six months ended march   compared to  for the six months ended march   due primarily to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year   the company recorded a loss from operations of  for the six months ended march   compared to a loss from operations of  for the six months ended march   the higher loss can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year          other expense was  for the six months ended march   compared to  for the six months ended march   primarily due to interest expense of  offset by miscellaneous nonoperating income of  for the six months ended march   and interest expense of  offset by miscellaneous nonoperating income of  for the six months ended march   other income generally consists of interest income sales of scrap material the forfeiture of nonrefundable deposits and other incidental items   the benefit for income taxes equaled  for the six months ended march   and a benefit of  for the six months ended march   the benefit for the six months ended march   can be attributed to a prior year’s federal refund any benefit for losses has been subject to a valuation allowance since the realization of the deferred tax benefit is not considered more likely than not as required by fasb asc  the company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realization of its deferred tax assets the company has determined that at this time it is more likely than not that the company will not realize all of the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and as a result a valuation allowance was established   offbalance sheet arrangements   at march   and  the company did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements          liquidity and capital resources   mfc defines liquidity as the ability to generate adequate funds to meet its operating and capital needs the

activities can fluctuate between periods as a result of differences in net income the timing of the collection of accounts receivable purchase of inventory and payment of accounts payable the decrease
