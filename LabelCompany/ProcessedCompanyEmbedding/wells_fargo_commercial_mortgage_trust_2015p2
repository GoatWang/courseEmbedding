is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property a business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest  commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable  until the loan is paid in full moreover a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender what distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower unlike residential mortgages which are geared toward the individual and  unit residential dwellings commercial property financing is designed for business entities  both for profit and notforprofit  to mortgage nearly any type of retail office industrial multiunit  unit residential or just about any other commercially zoned real property because of these property and borrower characteristics commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry the limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena if a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house to compensate for the greater risk commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements and loan terms are shorter typically a maximum of  years commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firms principals may be used to compensate a final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages but nearly every aspect of the due diligence phase  from valuation to title to underwriting  is more complicated and therefore more costly an illustration the vanilla commercial mortgage loan to help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice here are the major characteristics of a standard vanilla commercial mortgage loan debt coverage ratio commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower the lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments generally commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from  to  times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income for example if the monthly mortgage payment is  the property should be producing  to  after all expenses are paid down payment commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of  down a higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability prepayment penalties commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties that is a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made for example the fee might be  of the outstanding balance during the first year  the second year and so on with no penalty after the fifth year for obvious reasons prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to  or be able to  own the property long enough to avoid them although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them generally deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk for example an upfront fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment where to go for commercial real estate financing commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the us the three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are  commercial mortgage backed securities regional banks private equity companies  ie life insurance companies  pension manager  hedge funds specialty finance companies  ie thirdparty conduit and hard money lenders commercial mortgage brokers naturally most business owners turn to banks  particularly ones with whom they have established relationships  for their commercial real estate financing on the one hand banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates on the other they are the most rigid in their lending many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries they also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks because their money comes from private sources insurance companies and commercial lines of credit they can be much more flexible in their lending you will find that hard money lenders in particular will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers  all at a cost hard money lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks for larger capital needs companies often turn to private equity companies private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project the equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide  normally no more than  percent of costs so for a  million project commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than  million leaving  million in the equity range for the borrower to fund if the borrowing entity has  in cash to put into the project it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining  million private equity companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative flexible financing solutions but they expect a good return on investment so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders commercial mortgage brokers dont fund loans directly instead a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees a good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own as an added benefit commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in upfront fees a higher than market interest rate or both a good one though will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your companys specific needs at a competitive rate with so many choices it is important that you shop around but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate as is the case in residential mortgages commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next but with such a big financial commitment at stake unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan regardless of the source you ultimately use a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome preparation the key to a smooth commercial mortgage lending process when you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender some advance preparation will serve you well the complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to rate shop multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone  at least not with any reliability any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information which is needed to give you an informed accurate decision about your companys ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect  yeartodate profit  loss statement and balance sheet  three years business income tax returns  projected cash flow for the next  months  personal financial statement and resume for the principal property information  written business plan having these items available will not only make your task easier it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information you could be in for nasty surprises later commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company unlike other types of credit for business which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with longterm asset based financing at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment copyright   veteransbillrapponlinecom bill rapp terms

should carefully consider the risk factors relating to the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties   if any of the following events or circumstances identified as risks actually occur or materialize your investment could be materially and adversely affected we note that additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also impair your investment   this prospectus also contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks described below and elsewhere in this prospectus   the certificates may not be a suitable investment for you   the certificates will not be suitable investments for all investors in particular you should not purchase any class of certificates unless you understand and are able to bear the risk that the yield to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the certificates will be subject to material variability from period to period and give rise to the potential for significant loss over the life of the certificates the interaction of the foregoing factors and their effects are impossible to predict and are likely to change from time to time as a result an investment in the certificates involves substantial risks and uncertainties and should be considered only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate due diligence on the mortgage loans the mortgaged properties and the certificates   combination or “layering” of multiple risks may significantly increase risk of loss   although the various risks discussed in this prospectus are generally described separately you should consider the potential effects of the interplay of multiple risk factors where more than one significant risk factor is present the risk of loss to an investor in the certificates may be significantly increased   risks related to market conditions and other external factors   the volatile economy credit crisis and downturn in the real estate market have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the value of cmbs   in recent years the real estate and securitization markets including the market for commercial mortgagebacked securities “cmbs” experienced significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility we cannot assure you that another dislocation in cmbs will not occur   any economic downturn may adversely affect the financial resources of borrowers under commercial mortgage loans and may result in their inability to make payments on or refinance their outstanding mortgage debt when due or to sell their mortgaged properties        for an aggregate amount sufficient to pay off the outstanding debt when due as a result distributions of principal and interest on your certificates and the value of your certificates could be adversely affected   other events may affect the value and liquidity of your investment   moreover other types of events domestic or international may affect general economic conditions and financial markets   ·wars revolts terrorist attacks armed conflicts energy supply or price disruptions political crises natural disasters and manmade disasters may have an adverse effect on the mortgaged properties andor your certificates and   ·trading activity associated with indices of cmbs may drive spreads on those indices wider than spreads on cmbs thereby resulting in a decrease in value of such cmbs including your certificates and spreads on those indices may be affected by a variety of factors and may or may not be affected for reasons involving the commercial and multifamily real estate markets and may be affected for reasons that are unknown and cannot be discerned   you should consider that the foregoing factors may adversely affect the performance of the mortgage loans and accordingly the performance of the offered certificates   risks relating to the mortgage loans   mortgage loans are nonrecourse and are not insured or guaranteed   the mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed by any person or entity governmental or otherwise   investors should treat each mortgage loan as a nonrecourse loan if a default occurs recourse generally may be had only against the specific mortgaged properties and other assets that have been pledged to secure the mortgage loan consequently payment prior to maturity is dependent primarily on the sufficiency of the net operating income of the mortgaged property payment at maturity or anticipated repayment date is primarily dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property or the borrower’s ability to refinance or sell the mortgaged property   although the mortgage loans generally are nonrecourse in nature certain mortgage loans contain nonrecourse carveouts for liabilities such as liabilities as a result of fraud by the borrower certain voluntary insolvency proceedings or other matters certain mortgage loans set forth under “description of the mortgage pool—nonrecourse carveout limitations” either do not contain nonrecourse carveouts or contain material limitations to nonrecourse carveouts often these obligations are guaranteed by an affiliate of the related borrower although liability under any such guaranty may be capped or otherwise limited in amount or scope furthermore certain guarantors may be foreign entities or individuals which while subject to the domestic governing law provisions in the guaranty and related mortgage loan documents could nevertheless require enforcement of any judgment in relation to a guaranty in a foreign jurisdiction which could in turn cause a significant time delay or result in the inability to enforce the guaranty under foreign law additionally the guarantor’s net worth and liquidity may be less and in some cases materially less than amounts due under the related mortgage loan or the guarantor’s sole asset may be its interest in the related borrower certain mortgage loans may have the benefit of a general payment guaranty of a portion of the indebtedness under the mortgage loan in all cases        however the mortgage loans should be considered to be nonrecourse obligations because neither the depositor nor the sponsors make any representation or warranty as to the obligation or ability of any borrower or guarantor to pay any deficiencies between any foreclosure proceeds and the mortgage loan indebtedness   risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally   the mortgage loans will be secured by various incomeproducing commercial and multifamily properties the repayment of a commercial or multifamily loan is typically dependent upon the ability of the related mortgaged property to produce cash flow through the collection of rents even the liquidation value of a commercial property is determined in substantial part by the capitalization of the property’s ability to produce cash flow however net operating income can be volatile and may be insufficient to cover debt service on the loan at any given time   the net operating incomes and property values of the mortgaged properties may be adversely affected by a large number of factors some of these factors relate to the properties themselves such as   ·the age design and construction quality of the properties   ·perceptions regarding the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties   ·the characteristics and desirability of the area where the property is located   ·the strength and nature of the local economy including labor costs and quality tax environment and quality of life for employees   ·the proximity and attractiveness of competing properties   ·the adequacy of the property’s management and maintenance   ·increases in interest rates real estate taxes and operating expenses at the property and in relation to competing properties   ·an increase in the capital expenditures needed to maintain the properties or make improvements   ·the dependence upon a single tenant or concentration of tenants in a particular business or industry   ·a decline in the businesses operated by tenants or in their financial condition   ·an increase in vacancy rates and   ·a decline in rental rates as leases are renewed or entered into with new tenants   other factors are more general in nature such as   ·national or regional economic conditions including plant closings military base closings industry slowdowns oil andor gas drilling facility slowdowns or closings and unemployment rates   ·local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of competing properties retail space office space multifamily housing or hotel capacity        ·demographic factors   ·consumer confidence   ·consumer tastes and preferences   ·political factors   ·environmental factors   ·seismic activity risk   ·retroactive changes in building codes   ·changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments   ·location of certain mortgaged properties in less densely populated or less affluent areas and   ·the public perception of safety for customers and clients   the volatility of net operating income will be influenced by many of the foregoing factors as well as by   ·the length of tenant leases including that in certain cases all or substantially all of the tenants or one or more sole anchor or other major tenants at a particular mortgaged property may have leases that expire or permit the tenants to terminate its lease during the term of the loan   ·the quality and creditworthiness of tenants   ·tenant defaults   ·in the case of rental properties the rate at which new rentals occur and   ·the property’s “operating leverage” which is generally the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue the ratio of fixed operating expenses to those that vary with revenues and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace tenants   a decline in the real estate market or in the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of properties with relatively higher operating leverage or short term revenue sources such as short term or month to month leases and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults   performance of the mortgage loans will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases   general   any tenant may from time to time experience a downturn in its business which may weaken its financial condition and result in a reduction or failure to make rental payments when due if tenants’ sales were to decline percentage rents may decline and further tenants may be unable to pay their base rent or other occupancy costs if a tenant defaults in its obligations to a property owner that property owner may experience delays in enforcing its rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs and experience significant        delays associated with protecting its investment including costs incurred in renovating and reletting the property   additionally the income from and market value of the mortgaged properties leased to various tenants would be adversely affected if   ·space in the mortgaged properties could not be leased or released or substantial releasing costs were required andor the cost of performing landlord obligations under existing leases materially increased   ·leasing or releasing is restricted by exclusive rights of tenants to lease the mortgaged properties or other covenants not to lease space for certain uses or activities or covenants limiting the types of tenants to which space may be leased   ·a significant tenant were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case   ·rental payments could not be collected for any other reason or   ·a borrower fails to perform its obligations under a lease resulting in the related tenant having a right to terminate such lease   certain tenants currently may be in a rent abatement period we cannot assure you that such tenants will be in a position to pay full rent when the abatement period expires we cannot assure you that the net operating income contributed by the mortgaged properties will remain at its current or past levels   a tenant concentration may result in increased losses   mortgaged properties that are owneroccupied or leased to a single tenant or a tenant that makes up a significant portion of the rental income also are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if that tenant’s business operations are negatively impacted or if such tenant fails to renew its lease this is so because   ·the financial effect of the absence of rental income may be severe   ·more time may be required to release the space and   ·substantial capital costs may be incurred to make the space appropriate for replacement tenants   in the event of a default by that tenant if the related lease expires prior to the mortgage loan maturity date and the related tenant fails to renew its lease or if such tenant exercises an early termination option there would likely be an interruption of rental payments under the lease and accordingly insufficient funds available to the borrower to pay the debt service on the mortgage loan in certain cases where the tenant owns the improvements on the mortgaged property the related borrower may be required to purchase such improvements in connection with the exercise of its remedies   with respect to certain of these mortgaged properties that are leased to a single tenant the related leases may expire prior to or soon after the maturity dates of the mortgage loans or the related tenant may have the right to terminate the lease prior to the maturity date of the mortgage loan if the current tenant does not renew its lease on comparable economic terms to the expired lease if a single tenant terminates its lease or if a suitable replacement tenant does not enter into a new lease on similar economic terms there could be a negative impact on the payments on the related mortgage loan        a deterioration in the financial condition of a tenant the failure of a tenant to renew its lease or the exercise by a tenant of an early termination right can be particularly significant if a mortgaged property is owneroccupied leased to a single tenant or if any tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income at the mortgaged property   concentrations of particular tenants among the mortgaged properties or within a particular business or industry at one or multiple mortgaged properties increase the possibility that financial problems with such tenants or such business or industry sectors could affect the mortgage loans in addition the mortgage loans may be adversely affected if a tenant at the mortgaged property is highly specialized or dependent on a single industry or only a few customers for its revenue see “—tenant bankruptcy could result in a rejection of the related lease” below and “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—tenant concentrations” for information on tenant concentrations in the mortgage pool   mortgaged properties leased to multiple tenants also have risks   if a mortgaged property has multiple tenants releasing expenditures may be more frequent than in the case of mortgaged properties with fewer tenants thereby reducing the cash flow available for payments on the related mortgage loan multitenant mortgaged properties also may experience higher continuing vacancy rates and greater volatility in rental income and expenses see annex a for tenant lease expiration dates for the  largest tenants at each mortgaged property   mortgaged properties leased to borrowers or borrower affiliated entities also have risks   if a mortgaged property is leased in whole or substantial part to the borrower under the mortgage loan or to an affiliate of the borrower there may be conflicts of interest for instance it is more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated tenant we cannot assure you that the conflicts of interest arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property will not adversely impact the value of the related mortgage loan   in certain cases an affiliated lessee may be a tenant under a master lease with the related borrower under which the tenant is obligated to make rent payments but does not occupy any space at the mortgaged property master leases in these circumstances may be used to bring occupancy to a “stabilized” level with the intent of finding additional tenants to occupy some or all of the master leased space but may not provide additional economic support for the mortgage loan if a mortgaged property is leased in whole or substantial part to the borrower or to an affiliate of the borrower a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or its affiliates could significantly affect the borrower’s ability to perform under the mortgage loan as it would directly interrupt the cash flow from the mortgaged property if the borrower’s or its affiliate’s financial condition worsens we cannot assure you that any space leased by a borrower or an affiliate of the borrower will eventually be occupied by third party tenants   see “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—affiliated leases” for information on properties leased in whole or in part to borrowers and their affiliates   tenant bankruptcy could result in a rejection of the related lease   the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or a number of smaller tenants such as in retail properties may have an adverse impact on the mortgaged properties affected and        the income produced by such mortgaged properties under the federal bankruptcy code a tenant has the option of assuming or rejecting or subject to certain conditions assuming and assigning to a third party any unexpired lease if the tenant rejects the lease the landlord’s claim for breach of the lease would absent collateral securing the claim be treated as a general unsecured claim against the tenant and a lessor’s damages for lease rejection are generally subject to certain limitations we cannot assure you that tenants of the mortgaged properties will continue making payments under their leases or that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or if any tenants do file that they will continue to make rental payments in a timely manner see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws” see “description of the mortgage pool—loan purpose default history bankruptcy issues and other proceedings” for information regarding bankruptcy issues with respect to certain mortgage loans   in the case of certain mortgage loans included in the mortgage pool it may be possible that the related master lease could be construed in a bankruptcy as a financing lease or other arrangement under which the related master lessee andor its affiliates would be deemed as effectively the owner of the related mortgaged property rather than a tenant which could result in potentially adverse consequences for the trust as the holder of such mortgage loan including a potentially greater risk of an unfavorable plan of reorganization and competing claims of creditors of the related master lessee andor its affiliates see “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—affiliated leases”   leases that are not subordinated to the lien of the mortgage or do not contain attornment provisions may have an adverse impact at foreclosure   in certain jurisdictions if tenant leases are subordinated to the liens created by the mortgage but do not contain attornment provisions that require the tenant to recognize a successor owner the tenants may terminate their leases upon the transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser at foreclosure accordingly if a mortgaged property is located in such a jurisdiction and is leased to one or more desirable tenants under leases that are subordinate to the mortgage and do not contain attornment provisions such mortgaged property could experience a further decline in value if such tenants’ leases were terminated this is particularly likely if those tenants were paying abovemarket rents or could not be replaced if a lease is not subordinate to a mortgage the issuing entity will not possess the right to dispossess the tenant upon foreclosure of the mortgaged property unless otherwise agreed to with the tenant also if the lease contains provisions inconsistent with the mortgage eg provisions relating to application of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards or which could affect the enforcement of the lender’s rights eg a right of first refusal to purchase the property the provisions of the lease will take precedence over the provisions of the mortgage not all leases were reviewed to ascertain the existence of attornment or subordination provisions   with respect to certain of the mortgage loans the related borrower may have given to certain tenants or others an option to purchase a right of first refusal andor a right of first offer to purchase all or a portion of the mortgaged property in the event a sale is contemplated and such right is not subordinate to the related mortgage this may impede the mortgagee’s ability to sell the related mortgaged property at foreclosure or upon foreclosure this may affect the value andor marketability of the related mortgaged property see “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—purchase options and rights of first refusal” for information regarding material purchase options andor rights of first refusal if any with respect to mortgaged properties securing certain mortgage loans        early lease termination options may reduce cash flow   leases often give tenants the right to terminate the related lease abate or reduce the related rent andor exercise certain remedies against the related borrower for various reasons or upon various conditions including   ·if the borrower for the applicable mortgaged property allows uses at the mortgaged property in violation of use restrictions in current tenant leases   ·if the borrower or any of its affiliates owns other properties within a certain radius of the mortgaged property and allows uses at those properties in violation of use restrictions   ·if the related borrower fails to provide a designated number of parking spaces   ·if there is construction at the related mortgaged property or an adjacent property whether or not such adjacent property is owned or controlled by the borrower or any of its affiliates that may interfere with visibility of access to or a tenant’s use of the mortgaged property or otherwise violate the terms of a tenant’s lease   ·upon casualty or condemnation with respect to all or a portion of the mortgaged property that renders such mortgaged property unsuitable for a tenant’s use or if the borrower fails to rebuild such mortgaged property within a certain time   ·if a tenant’s use is not permitted by zoning or applicable law   ·if the tenant is unable to exercise an expansion right   ·if the landlord defaults on its obligations under the lease   ·if a landlord leases space at the mortgaged property or within a certain radius of the mortgaged property to a competitor   ·if the tenant fails to meet certain sales targets or other business objectives for a specified period of time   ·if significant tenants at the subject property go dark or terminate their leases or if a specified percentage of the mortgaged property is unoccupied   ·if the landlord violates the tenant’s exclusive use rights for a specified period of time   ·if the related borrower violates covenants under the related lease or if third parties take certain actions that adversely affect such tenants’ business or operations   ·in the case of government sponsored tenants at any time or for lack of appropriations or   ·if the related borrower violates covenants under the related lease or if third parties take certain actions that adversely affect such tenants’ business or operations   in certain cases compliance or satisfaction of landlord covenants may be the responsibility of a third party affiliated with the borrower or in the event that partial releases of the applicable mortgaged property are permitted an unaffiliated or affiliated third party        any exercise of a termination right by a tenant at a mortgaged property could result in vacant space at the related mortgaged property renegotiation of the lease with the related tenant or reletting of the space any such vacated space may not be relet furthermore such foregoing termination andor abatement rights may arise in the future or materially adversely affect the related borrower’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents see “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—lease expirations and terminations” for information on material tenant lease expirations and early termination options   mortgaged properties leased to notforprofit tenants also have risks   certain mortgaged properties may have tenants that are charitable institutions that generally rely on contributions from individuals and government grants or other subsidies to pay rent on office space and other operating expenses we cannot assure you that the rate frequency and level of individual contributions or governmental grants and subsidies will continue with respect to any such institution a reduction in contributions or grants may impact the ability of the related institution to pay rent and we cannot assure you that the related borrower will be in a position to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents if such tenant fails to pay its rent   retail properties have special risks   the value of retail properties is significantly affected by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate such as location and market demographics as further described in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” and “—performance of the mortgage loans will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases” above the correlation between success of tenant business and a retail property’s value may be more direct with respect to retail properties than other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage of gross sales   whether a retail property is “anchored” “shadow anchored” or “unanchored” is also an important consideration retail properties that have anchor tenantowned stores often have reciprocal easement andor operating agreements each an “rea” between the retail property owner and such anchor tenants containing certain operating and maintenance covenants although an anchor tenant is often required to pay a contribution toward common area maintenance and real estate taxes on the improvements and related real property an anchor tenant that owns its own parcel does not pay rent however the presence or absence of an “anchor tenant” or a “shadow anchor tenant” in or near a retail property also can be important because anchors play a key role in generating customer traffic and making a retail property desirable for other tenants many of the retail properties that will secure one or more mortgage loans will also have shadow anchor tenants an “anchor tenant” is located on the related mortgaged property usually proportionately larger in size than most or all other tenants in the mortgaged property and is vital in attracting customers to a retail property a “shadow anchor tenant” is usually proportionally larger in size than most tenants in the mortgaged property is important in attracting customers to a retail property and is located sufficiently close and convenient to the mortgaged property so as to influence and attract potential customers but is not located on the mortgaged property        the economic performance of an anchored or shadow anchored retail property will consequently be adversely affected by   ·an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s failure to renew its lease or the termination of an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s lease   ·an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s decision to vacate   ·the bankruptcy or economic decline of an anchor tenant shadow anchor or selfowned anchor or   ·the cessation of the business of an anchor tenant a shadow anchor tenant or of a selfowned anchor or a change in use or in the nature of its retail operations notwithstanding its continued payment of rent   if anchor stores in a mortgaged property were to close the related borrower may be unable to replace those anchors in a timely manner or without suffering adverse economic consequences in addition it is common for anchor tenants and nonanchor tenants at anchored or shadow anchored retail centers to have cotenancy clauses andor operating covenants in their leases or operating agreements that permit those tenants or anchor stores to cease operating reduce rent or terminate their leases if an anchor or shadow anchor tenant goes dark even if nonanchor tenants do not have termination or rent abatement rights because the anchor or shadow anchor tenant plays a key role in generating customer traffic and making a center desirable for other tenants the loss of an anchor tenant or a shadow anchor tenant may have a material adverse impact on the nonanchor tenant’s ability to operate which may in turn adversely impact the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents in addition in the event that a “shadow anchor” fails to renew its lease terminates its lease or otherwise ceases to conduct business within a close proximity to the mortgaged property customer traffic at the mortgaged property may be substantially reduced if an anchor tenant goes dark generally the borrower’s only remedy is to terminate that lease after the anchor tenant has been dark for a specified amount of time   we cannot assure you that if anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants at a particular mortgaged property were to close or otherwise become vacant or remain vacant such anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants as applicable would be replaced in a timely manner or if part of the collateral for the related mortgage loan without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower and resulting in adverse economic effects   certain of the tenants or anchor tenants of the retail properties may have operating covenants in their leases or operating agreements which permit those tenants or anchor tenants to cease operating reduce rent or terminate their leases if the subject store is not meeting the minimum sales requirement under its lease   in addition the limited adaptability of certain shopping malls that have proven unprofitable may result in high and possibly extremely high loss severities on mortgage loans secured by those shopping malls for example it is possible that a significant amount of advances made by the applicable servicers of a mortgage loan secured by a shopping mall property combined with low liquidation proceeds in respect of that property may result in a loss severity exceeding  of the outstanding principal balance of that mortgage loan   certain anchor tenant and tenant estoppels will have been obtained in connection with the origination of the mortgage loans that may identify disputes between the related        borrower and the applicable anchor tenant or tenant or alleged defaults or potential defaults by the applicable property owner under the lease or rea such disputes defaults or potential defaults could lead to a termination or attempted termination of the applicable lease or rea by the anchor tenant or tenant or to litigation against the related borrower we cannot assure you that these anchor tenant and tenant disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the related borrowers to repay their portion of the mortgage loan in addition we cannot assure you that the anchor tenant or tenant estoppels obtained identify all potential disputes that may arise with anchor tenants or tenants who did not provide estoppels prior to origination we cannot assure you that the failure to have obtained related estoppel information will not have a material adverse effect on the related mortgage loans   rental payments from tenants of retail properties typically comprise the largest portion of the net operating income of those mortgaged properties we cannot assure you that the rate of occupancy at the stores will remain at the levels described in this prospectus or that the net operating income contributed by the mortgaged properties will remain at the level specified in this prospectus or remain consistent with past levels   retail properties also face competition from sources outside a given real estate market for example all of the following compete with more traditional retail properties for consumer dollars factory outlet centers discount shopping centers and clubs catalogue retailers home shopping networks internet websites and telemarketing continued growth of these alternative retail outlets which often have lower operating costs could adversely affect the rents collectible at the retail properties included in the pool of mortgage loans as well as the income from and market value of the mortgaged properties and the related borrower’s ability to refinance such property moreover additional competing retail properties may be built in the areas where the retail properties are located   certain retail properties have specialty use tenants see “—some mortgaged properties may not be readily convertible to alternative uses” below   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—retail properties”   multifamily properties have special risks   in addition to the factors discussed in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” and “—performance of the mortgage loans will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases” above other factors may adversely affect the financial performance and value of multifamily properties including   ·the quality of property management   ·the ability of management to provide adequate maintenance and insurance   ·the types of services or amenities that the property provides   ·the property’s reputation   ·the level of mortgage interest rates which may encourage tenants to purchase rather than lease housing   ·the generally short terms of residential leases and the need for continued reletting        ·rent concessions and monthtomonth leases which may impact cash flow at the property   ·the tenant mix such as the tenant population being predominantly students or being heavily dependent on workers from a particular business or industry or personnel from or workers related to a local military base or oil andor gas drilling industries   ·in the case of student housing facilities or properties leased primarily to students which may be more susceptible to damage or wear and tear than other types of multifamily housing the reliance on the financial wellbeing of the college or university to which it relates competition from on campus housing units which may adversely affect occupancy the physical layout of the housing which may not be readily convertible to traditional multifamily use and that student tenants have a higher turnover rate than other types of multifamily tenants which in certain cases is compounded by the fact that student leases are available for periods of less than  months   ·certain multifamily properties may be considered to be “flexible apartment properties” such properties have a significant percentage of units leased to tenants under shortterm leases less than one year in term which creates a higher turnover rate than for other types of multifamily properties   ·restrictions on the age of tenants who may reside at the property   ·dependence upon governmental programs that provide rent subsidies to tenants pursuant to tenant voucher programs which vouchers may be used at other properties and influence tenant mobility   ·adverse local regional or national economic conditions which may limit the amount of rent that may be charged and may result in a reduction of timely rent payments or a reduction in occupancy levels   ·state and local regulations which may affect the building owner’s ability to increase rent to market rent for an equivalent apartment and   ·the existence of government assistancerent subsidy programs and whether or not they continue and provide the same level of assistance or subsidies   certain states regulate the relationship between an owner and its tenants commonly these laws require a written lease good cause for eviction disclosure of fees and notification to residents of changed land use while prohibiting unreasonable rules retaliatory evictions and restrictions on a resident’s choice of unit vendors apartment building owners have been the subject of suits under state “unfair and deceptive practices acts” and other general consumer protection statutes for coercive abusive or unconscionable leasing and sales practices a few states offer more significant protection for example there are provisions that limit the bases on which a landlord may terminate a tenancy or increase a tenant’s rent or prohibit a landlord from terminating a tenancy solely by reason of the sale of the owner’s building   in addition to state regulation of the landlord tenant relationship numerous counties and municipalities impose rent control on apartment buildings these ordinances may limit rent increases to fixed percentages to percentages of increases in the consumer price index to increases set or approved by a governmental agency or to increases determined through mediation or binding arbitration any limitations on a borrower’s ability to raise        property rents may impair such borrower’s ability to repay its multifamily loan from its net operating income or the proceeds of a sale or refinancing of the related multifamily property   certain of the mortgage loans may be secured in the future by mortgaged properties that are subject to certain affordable housing covenants and other covenants and restrictions with respect to various tax credit city state and federal housing subsidies rent stabilization or similar programs in respect of various units within the mortgaged properties the limitations and restrictions imposed by these programs could result in losses on the mortgage loans in addition in the event that the program is cancelled it could result in less income for the project these programs may include among others   ·rent limitations that would adversely affect the ability of borrowers to increase rents to maintain the condition of their mortgaged properties and satisfy operating expense and   ·tenant income restrictions that may reduce the number of eligible tenants in those mortgaged properties and result in a reduction in occupancy rates   the difference in rents between subsidized or supported properties and other multifamily rental properties in the same area may not be a sufficient economic incentive for some eligible tenants to reside at a subsidized or supported property that may have fewer amenities or be less attractive as a residence as a result occupancy levels at a subsidized or supported property may decline which may adversely affect the value and successful operation of such property   certain of the multifamily properties may be residential cooperative buildings and the land under any such building is owned or leased by a nonprofit residential cooperative corporation the cooperative owns all the units in the building and all common areas its tenants own stock shares or membership certificates in the corporation this ownership entitles the tenantstockholders to proprietary leases or occupancy agreements which confer exclusive rights to occupy specific units generally the tenantstockholders make monthly maintenance payments which represent their share of the cooperative corporation’s mortgage loan payments real property taxes reserve contributions and capital expenditures maintenance and other expenses less any income the corporation may receive these payments are in addition to any payments of principal and interest the tenantstockholder may be required to make on any loans secured by its shares in the cooperative   a number of factors may adversely affect the value and successful operation of a residential cooperative property some of these factors include   ·the primary dependence of a borrower upon maintenance payments and any rental income from units or commercial areas to meet debt service obligations   ·the initial concentration of shares relating to occupied rental units of the sponsor owner or investor after conversion from rental housing which may result in an inability to meet debt service obligations on the residential cooperative corporation’s mortgage loan if the sponsor owner or investor is unable to make the required maintenance payments   ·the failure of a borrower to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a “cooperative housing corporation” each year which may reduce the cash flow available to make payments on the related mortgage loan and        ·that upon foreclosure in the event a cooperative property becomes a rental property certain units could be subject to rent control stabilization and tenants’ rights laws at below market rents which may affect rental income levels and the marketability and sale proceeds of the rental property as a whole   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—multifamily properties”   hotel properties have special risks   in addition to the factors discussed in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” above various other factors may adversely affect the financial performance and value of hotel properties including   ·adverse economic and social conditions either local regional or national which may limit the amount that can be charged for a room and reduce occupancy levels   ·continuing expenditures for modernizing refurbishing and maintaining existing facilities prior to the expiration of their anticipated useful lives   ·ability to convert to alternative uses which may not be readily made   ·a deterioration in the financial strength or managerial capabilities of the owner or operator of a hotel property   ·changes in travel patterns caused by general adverse economic conditions fear of terrorist attacks adverse weather conditions and changes in access energy prices strikes travel costs relocation of highways the construction of additional highways concerns about travel safety or other factors and   ·relative illiquidity of hospitality investments which limits the ability of the borrowers and property managers to respond to changes in economic or other conditions   because hotel rooms are generally rented for short periods of time the financial performance of hotel properties tends to be affected by adverse economic conditions and competition more quickly than other commercial properties additionally as a result of high operating costs relatively small decreases in revenue can cause significant stress on a property’s cash flow   moreover the hospitality and lodging industry is generally seasonal in nature and different seasons affect different hotel properties differently depending on type and location this seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in a hotel property’s room and restaurant revenues occupancy levels room rates and operating expenses we cannot assure you that cash flow will be sufficient to offset any shortfalls that occur at the mortgaged property during slower periods or that the related mortgage loans provide for seasonality reserves or if seasonality reserves are provided for that such reserves will be funded or will be sufficient or available to fund such shortfalls   in addition certain hotel properties are limitedservice select service or extended stay hotels hotel properties that are limitedservice select service or extended stay hotels may subject a lender to more risk than fullservice hotel properties as they generally require less capital for construction than fullservice hotel properties in addition as limitedservice select service or extended stay hotels generally offer fewer amenities than fullservice hotel properties they are less distinguishable from each other as a result it is easier for        limitedservice select service or extended stay hotels to experience increased or unforeseen competition   in addition to hotel operations some hotel properties also operate entertainment complexes that include restaurants lounges nightclubs andor banquet and meeting spaces and may derive a significant portion of the related property’s revenue from such operations consumer demand for entertainment resorts is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions high energy fuel and food costs the increased cost of travel the weakened job market perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy or fears of war and future acts of terrorism these factors could reduce consumer demand for the leisure activities that the property offers thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming operations restaurants and nightclubs are particularly vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences in addition a nightclub’s restaurant’s or bar’s revenue is extremely dependent on its popularity and perception these characteristics are subject to change rapidly and we cannot assure you that any of a hotel property’s nightclubs restaurants or bars will maintain their current level of popularity or perception in the market any such change could have a material adverse effect on the net cash flow of the property   some of the hotel properties have liquor licenses associated with the mortgaged property the liquor licenses for these mortgaged properties are generally held by affiliates of the related borrowers unaffiliated managers or operating lessees the laws and regulations relating to liquor licenses generally prohibit the transfer of such licenses to any person or condition such transfer on the prior approval of the governmental authority that issued the license in the event of a foreclosure of a hotel property that holds a liquor license the special servicer on behalf of the issuing entity or a purchaser in a foreclosure sale would likely have to apply for a new license which might not be granted or might be granted only after a delay that could be significant we cannot assure you that a new license could be obtained promptly or at all the lack of a liquor license in a hotel property could have an adverse impact on the revenue from the related mortgaged property or on the hotel property’s occupancy rate   in addition there may be risks associated with hotel properties that have not entered into or become a party to any franchise agreement license agreement or other “flag” hotel properties often enter into these types of agreements in order to align the hotel property with a certain public perception or to benefit from a centralized reservation system we cannot assure you that hotel properties that lack such benefits will be able to operate successfully on an independent basis   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—hotel properties”   risks relating to affiliation with a franchise or hotel management company   the performance of a hotel property affiliated with a franchise or hotel management company depends in part on   ·the continued existence and financial strength of the franchisor or hotel management company   ·the public perception of the franchise or hotel chain service mark and        ·the duration of the franchise licensing or management agreements   the continuation of a franchise agreement or management agreement is subject to specified operating standards and other terms and conditions set forth in such agreements the failure of a borrower to maintain such standards or adhere to other applicable terms and conditions such as property improvement plans could result in the loss or cancellation of their rights under the franchise or hotel management company agreement or management agreement we cannot assure you that a replacement franchise could be obtained in the event of termination or that such replacement franchise affiliation would be of equal quality to the terminated franchise affiliation in addition replacement franchises andor hotel property managers may require significantly higher fees as well as the investment of capital to bring the hotel property into compliance with the requirements of the replacement franchisor andor hotel property managers any provision in a franchise agreement or management agreement providing for termination because of a bankruptcy of a franchisor or manager generally will not be enforceable   the transferability of franchise agreements license agreements and the property management agreements is restricted in the event of a foreclosure the lender may not have the right to use the franchise license without the franchisor’s consent or the manager might be able to terminate the management agreement conversely in the case of certain mortgage loans the lender may be unable to remove a franchisorlicensor or a hotel management company that it desires to replace following a foreclosure and further may be limited as regards the pool of potential transferees for a foreclosure or real estate owned property   in some cases where a hotel property is subject to a license or franchise agreement the licensor or franchisor has required or may in the future require the completion of various repairs andor renovations pursuant to a property improvement plan issued by the franchisor failure to complete those repairs andor renovations in accordance with the plan could result in the hotel property losing its license or franchise annex a and the related footnotes set forth the amount of reserves if any established under the related mortgage loans in connection with any of those repairs andor renovations we cannot assure you that any amounts reserved will be sufficient to complete the repairs andor renovations required with respect to any affected hotel property in addition in some cases those reserves will be maintained by the franchisor or property manager furthermore the lender may not require a reserve for repairs andor renovations in all instances   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—hotel properties”   industrial properties have special risks   in addition to the factors discussed in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” and “—performance of the mortgage loans will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases” above other factors may adversely affect the financial performance and value of industrial properties including   ·reduced demand for industrial space because of a decline in a particular industry segment   ·the property becoming functionally obsolete   ·building design and adaptability        ·unavailability of labor sources   ·changes in access energy prices strikes relocation of highways the construction of additional highways or other factors   ·changes in proximity of supply sources   ·the expenses of converting a previously adapted space to general use and   ·the location of the property   industrial properties may be adversely affected by reduced demand for industrial space occasioned by a decline in a particular industry segment in which the related tenants conduct their businesses for example a decline in consumer demand for products sold by a tenant using the property as a distribution center in addition a particular industrial or warehouse property that suited the needs of its original tenant may be difficult to relet to another tenant or may become functionally obsolete relative to newer properties furthermore lease terms with respect to industrial properties are generally for shorter periods of time and may result in a substantial percentage of leases expiring in the same year at any particular industrial property in addition mortgaged properties used for many industrial purposes are more prone to environmental concerns than other property types   aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of an industrial property site characteristics that are generally desirable to a warehouseindustrial property include high clear ceiling heights wide column spacing a large number of bays loading docks and large bay depths divisibility a layout that can accommodate large truck minimum turning radii and overall functionality and accessibility   in addition because of unique construction requirements of many industrial properties any vacant industrial property space may not be easily converted to other uses thus if the operation of any of the industrial properties becomes unprofitable due to competition age of the improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan the liquidation value of that industrial property may be substantially less relative to the amount owing on the related mortgage loan than would be the case if the industrial property were readily adaptable to other uses   location is also important because an industrial property requires the availability of labor sources proximity to supply sources and customers and accessibility to rail lines major roadways and other distribution channels   further certain of the industrial properties may have tenants that are subject to risks unique to their business such as cold storage facilities cold storage facilities may have unique risks such as short lease terms due to seasonal use making income potentially more volatile than for properties with longer term leases and customized refrigeration design rendering such facilities less readily convertible to alternative uses because of seasonal use leases at such facilities are customarily for shorter terms making income potentially more volatile than for properties with longer term leases in addition such facilities require customized refrigeration design rendering them less readily convertible to alternative uses   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—industrial properties”        self storage properties have special risks   in addition to the factors discussed in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” above other factors may adversely affect the financial performance and value of self storage properties including   ·decreased demand   ·lack of proximity to apartment complexes or commercial users   ·apartment tenants moving to single family homes   ·decline in services rendered including security   ·dependence on business activity ancillary to renting units   ·security concerns   ·age of improvements or   ·competition or other factors   self storage properties are considered vulnerable to competition because both acquisition costs and breakeven occupancy are relatively low the conversion of self storage facilities to alternative uses would generally require substantial capital expenditures thus if the operation of any of the self storage properties becomes unprofitable the liquidation value of that self storage mortgaged property may be substantially less relative to the amount owing on the mortgage loan than if the self storage mortgaged property were readily adaptable to other uses   tenants at self storage properties tend to require and receive privacy anonymity and efficient access each of which may heighten environmental and other risks related to such property as the borrower may be unaware of the contents in any self storage unit no environmental assessment of a self storage mortgaged property included an inspection of the contents of the self storage units at that mortgaged property and there is no assurance that all of the units included in the self storage mortgaged properties are free from hazardous substances or other pollutants or contaminants or will remain so in the future   certain mortgage loans secured by self storage properties may be affiliated with a franchise company through a franchise agreement the performance of a self storage property affiliated with a franchise company may be affected by the continued existence and financial strength of the franchisor the public perception of a service mark and the duration of the franchise agreement the transferability of franchise license agreements is restricted in the event of a foreclosure the lender or its agent would not have the right to use the franchise license without the franchisor’s consent in addition certain self storage properties may derive a material portion of revenue from business activities ancillary to self storage such as truck rentals parking fees and similar activities which require special use permits or other discretionary zoning approvals see annex a and the footnotes related thereto   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—self storage properties”        office properties have special risks   in addition to the factors discussed in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” and “—performance of the mortgage loans will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases” above other factors may adversely affect the financial performance and value of office properties including   ·the physical attributes of the building in relation to competing buildings eg age condition design appearance access to transportation and ability to offer certain amenities such as sophisticated building systems andor business wiring requirements   ·the adaptability of the building to changes in the technological needs of the tenants   ·an adverse change in population patterns of telecommuting or sharing of office space and employment growth which creates demand for office space and   ·in the case of a medical office property a the proximity of such property to a hospital or other healthcare establishment b reimbursements for patient fees from private or government sponsored insurers c its ability to attract doctors and nurses to be on staff and d its ability to afford and acquire the latest medical equipment issues related to reimbursement ranging from nonpayment to delays in payment from such insurers could adversely impact cash flow at such mortgaged property   moreover the cost of refitting office space for a new tenant is often higher than the cost of refitting other types of properties for new tenants   if one or more major tenants at a particular office property were to close or remain vacant we cannot assure you that such tenants would be replaced in a timely manner or without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower and resulting in an adverse effect on the financial performance of the property   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—office properties”   mixed use properties have special risks   certain properties are mixed use properties such mortgaged properties are subject to the risks relating to the property types described in “—office properties have special risks” “—retail properties have special risks” “—hotel properties have special risks” “—multifamily properties have special risks” “—manufactured housing community properties have special risks” “—industrial properties have special risks” “—self storage properties have special risks” “—condominium ownership may limit use and improvements” and “—leased fee properties have special risks” as applicable see annex a for the  largest tenants by net rentable area leased at the mixed use property a mixed use property may be subject to additional risks including the property manager’s inexperience in managing the different property types that comprise such mixed use property   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types—mixed use properties”        manufactured housing community properties have special risks   in addition to the factors discussed in “—risks of commercial and multifamily lending generally” and “—performance of the mortgage loans will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases” above other factors may adversely affect the financial performance and value of manufactured housing community properties including   ·the number of competing residential developments in the local market such as other manufactured housing community properties apartment buildings and site built single family homes   ·the physical attributes of the community including its age and appearance   ·the location of the manufactured housing property   ·the presence andor continued presence of sufficient manufactured homes at the manufactured housing property manufactured homes are not generally part of the collateral for a mortgage loan secured by a manufactured housing property rather the pads upon which manufactured homes are located are leased to the owners of such manufactured homes manufactured homes may be moved from a manufactured housing property   ·the type of services or amenities it provides   ·any age restrictions   ·the property’s reputation and   ·state and local regulations including rent control and rent stabilization and tenant association rights   the manufactured housing community properties have few improvements which are highly specialized and are “single purpose” properties that could not be readily converted to general residential retail or office use thus if the operation of any of the manufactured housing community properties becomes unprofitable due to competition age of the improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan the liquidation value of that manufactured housing property may be substantially less relative to the amount owing on the related mortgage loan than would be the case if the manufactured housing community property were readily adaptable to other uses   some manufactured housing community properties are either recreational vehicle resorts or have a significant portion of the properties that are intended for shortterm recreational vehicle hookups and tenancy of these communities may vary significantly by season this seasonality may cause periodic fluctuations in revenues tenancy levels rental rates and operating expenses for these properties   some of the manufactured housing community mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in the trust may have a material number of leased homes that are currently owned by the related borrower or an affiliate thereof and rented by the respective tenants like apartments in circumstances where the leased homes are owned by an affiliate of the borrower the related pads may in some cases be subject to a master lease with that affiliate in such cases the tenants will tend to be more transient and less tied to the property than if they owned their own home such leased homes do not in all or possibly in any such cases constitute collateral for the related mortgage loan some of the leased        homes that are not collateral for the related mortgage loan are rented on a leasetoown basis in some cases the borrower itself owns leases sells andor finances the sale of homes although generally the related income therefrom will be excluded for loan underwriting purposes see also representation and warranty no  on annex d to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on annex d to this prospectus subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to annex d to this prospectus some of the leased homes owned by a borrower or its affiliate may be financed and a default on that financing may materially adversely affect the performance of the manufactured housing community mortgaged property   certain of the manufactured housing community mortgaged properties may not be connected in their entirety to public water andor sewer systems in such cases the borrower could incur a substantial expense if it were required to connect the property to such systems in the future in addition the use of well water enhances the likelihood that the property could be adversely affected by a recognized environmental condition that impacts soil and groundwater   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics”   operation of a mortgaged property depends on the property manager’s performance   the successful operation of a real estate project depends upon the property manager’s performance and viability the property manager is responsible for   ·responding to changes in the local market   ·planning and implementing the rental structure   ·operating the property and providing building services   ·managing operating expenses and   ·assuring that maintenance and capital improvements are carried out in a timely fashion   properties deriving revenues primarily from short term sources such as hotel guests or short term or month to month leases are generally more management intensive than properties leased to creditworthy tenants under long term leases   certain of the mortgaged properties will be managed by affiliates of the related borrower if a mortgage loan is in default or undergoing special servicing such relationship could disrupt the management of the related mortgaged property which may adversely affect cash flow however the related mortgage loans will generally permit in the case of mortgaged properties managed by borrower affiliates the lender to remove the related property manager upon the occurrence of an event of default under the related mortgage loan beyond applicable cure periods or in some cases in the event of a foreclosure following such default and in some cases a decline in cash flow below a specified level or the failure to satisfy some other specified performance trigger   concentrations based on property type geography related borrowers and other factors may disproportionately increase losses   the effect of mortgage pool loan losses will be more severe if the losses relate to mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the pool’s        aggregate principal balance as mortgage loans pay down or properties are released the remaining mortgage loans may face a higher risk with respect to the diversity of property types and property characteristics and with respect to the number of borrowers   see the tables entitled “remaining term to maturityard in months” in annex a for a stratification of the remaining terms to maturity of the mortgage loans because principal on the certificates is payable in sequential order of payment priority and a class receives principal only after the preceding classes have been paid in full classes that have a lower sequential priority are more likely to face these types of risk of concentration than classes with a higher sequential priority   several of the mortgage loans have cutoff date balances that are substantially higher than the average cutoff date balance in general concentrations in mortgage loans with largerthanaverage balances can result in losses that are more severe relative to the size of the mortgage loan pool than would be the case if the aggregate balance of the mortgage loan pool were more evenly distributed   a concentration of mortgage loans secured by the same mortgaged property types can increase the risk that a decline in a particular industry or business would have a disproportionately large impact on the pool of mortgage loans mortgaged property types representing more than  of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date based on allocated loan amount are retail multifamily hospitality industrial self storage office and other see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—property types” for information on the types of mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool   repayments by borrowers and the market value of the related mortgaged properties could be affected by economic conditions generally or specific to particular geographic areas or regions of the united states and concentrations of mortgaged properties in particular geographic areas may increase the risk that conditions in the real estate market where the mortgaged property is located or other adverse economic or other developments or natural disasters eg earthquakes floods forest fires tornadoes or hurricanes or changes in governmental rules or fiscal policies affecting a particular region of the country could increase the frequency and severity of losses on mortgage loans secured by those mortgaged properties   mortgaged properties securing  or more of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cutoff date based on allocated loan amount are located in california virginia south dakota new york florida texas washington and new jersey see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—geographic concentrations”   some of the mortgaged properties are located in areas that based on low population density poor economic demographics such as higher than average unemployment rates lower than average annual household income andor overall loss of jobs andor negative trends in such regards would be considered secondary or tertiary markets   a concentration of mortgage loans with the same borrower or related borrowers also can pose increased risks   ·if a borrower that owns or controls several mortgaged properties whether or not all of them secure mortgage loans in the mortgage pool experiences financial difficulty at one mortgaged property it could defer maintenance at another        mortgaged property in order to satisfy current expenses with respect to the first mortgaged property   ·a borrower could also attempt to avert foreclosure by filing a bankruptcy petition that might have the effect of interrupting debt service payments on the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool secured by that borrower’s mortgaged properties subject to the master servicer’s and the trustee’s obligation to make advances for monthly payments for an indefinite period and   ·mortgaged properties owned by the same borrower or related borrowers are likely to have common management common general partners andor common managing members increasing the risk that financial or other difficulties experienced by such related parties could have a greater impact on the pool of mortgage loans see “—a bankruptcy proceeding may result in losses and delays in realizing on the mortgage loans” below   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics” for information on the composition of the mortgage pool by property type and geographic distribution and loan concentration   adverse environmental conditions at or near mortgaged properties may result in losses   the issuing entity could become liable for a material adverse environmental condition at an underlying mortgaged property any such potential liability could reduce or delay payments on the offered certificates   each of the mortgaged properties was either i subject to environmental site assessments prior to the time of origination of the related mortgage loan or in certain limited cases after origination including phase i environmental site assessments or updates of previously performed phase i environmental site assessments or ii subject to a secured creditor environmental insurance policy or other environmental insurance policy see “description of the mortgage pool—environmental considerations”   we cannot assure you that the environmental assessments revealed all existing or potential environmental risks or that all adverse environmental conditions have been or will be completely abated or remediated or that any reserves insurance or operations and maintenance plans will be sufficient to remediate the environmental conditions moreover we cannot assure you that   ·future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or   ·the current environmental condition of the mortgaged properties will not be adversely affected by tenants or by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the mortgaged properties such as underground storage tanks   we cannot assure you that with respect to any mortgaged property any remediation plan or any projected remedial costs or time is accurate or sufficient to complete the remediation objectives or that no additional contamination requiring environmental investigation or remediation will not be discovered on any mortgaged property likewise all environmental policies naming the lender as named insured cover certain risks or events specifically identified in the policy but the coverage is limited by its terms conditions limitations and exclusions and does not purport to cover all environmental conditions        whatsoever affecting the applicable mortgaged property and we cannot assure you that any environmental conditions currently known suspected or unknown and discovered in the future will be covered by the terms of the policy   before the trustee or the special servicer as applicable acquires title to a mortgaged property on behalf of the issuing entity or assumes operation of the property it will be required to obtain an environmental assessment of such mortgaged property or rely on a recent environmental assessment this requirement is intended to mitigate the risk that the issuing entity will become liable under any environmental law there is accordingly some risk that the mortgaged property will decline in value while this assessment is being obtained or remedial action is being taken moreover we cannot assure you that this requirement will effectively insulate the issuing entity from potential liability under environmental laws any such potential liability could reduce or delay distributions to certificateholders   see “description of the mortgage pool—environmental considerations” for additional information on environmental conditions at mortgaged

  risks related to redevelopment expansion and renovation at mortgaged properties   certain of the mortgaged properties are properties which are currently undergoing or in the future are expected to undergo redevelopment expansion or renovation to the extent applicable we cannot assure you that any escrow or reserve collected if any will be sufficient to complete the current renovation or be otherwise sufficient to satisfy any tenant improvement expenses at a mortgaged property failure to complete those planned improvements may have a material adverse effect on the cash flow at the mortgaged property and the related borrower’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the mortgage loan documents   certain of the hotel properties securing the mortgage loans are currently undergoing or are scheduled to undergo renovations or property improvement plans “pips” in some circumstances these renovations or pips may necessitate taking a portion of the available guest rooms temporarily offline temporarily decreasing the number of available rooms and the revenue generating capacity of the related hotel property in other cases these renovations may involve renovations of common spaces or external features of the related hotel property which may cause disruptions or otherwise decrease the attractiveness of the related hotel property to potential guests these pips may be required under the related franchise or management agreement and a failure to timely complete them may result in a        termination or expiration of a franchise or management agreement and may be an event of default under the related mortgage loan   certain of the retail properties securing the mortgage loans may currently be undergoing or are scheduled to undergo renovations or property expansions such renovations or expansions may be required under tenant leases and a failure to timely complete such renovations or expansions may result in a termination of such lease and may have a material adverse effect on the cash flow at the mortgaged property and the related borrower’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the mortgage loan documents   we cannot assure you that current or planned redevelopment expansion or renovation will be completed at all that such redevelopment expansion or renovation will be completed in the time frame contemplated or that when and if such redevelopment expansion or renovation is completed such redevelopment expansion or renovation will improve the operations at or increase the value of the related mortgaged property failure of any of the foregoing to occur could have a material negative impact on the related mortgaged property which could affect the ability of the related borrower to repay the related mortgage loan   in the event the related borrower fails to pay the costs for work completed or material delivered in connection with such ongoing redevelopment expansion or renovation the portion of the mortgaged property on which there are renovations may be subject to mechanic’s or materialmen’s liens that may be senior to the lien of the related mortgage loan   the existence of construction or renovation at a mortgaged property may take rental units or rooms or leasable space “offline” or otherwise make space unavailable for rental impair access or traffic at or near the mortgaged property or in general make that mortgaged property less attractive to tenants or their customers and accordingly could have a negative effect on net operating income in addition any such construction or renovation at a mortgaged property may temporarily interfere with the use and operation of any portion of such mortgaged property see “description of the mortgage pool—redevelopment renovation and expansion” for information regarding mortgaged properties which are currently undergoing or in the future are expected to undergo redevelopment expansion or renovation see also annex a for additional information on redevelopment renovation and expansion at the mortgaged properties securing the  largest mortgage loans or groups of crosscollateralized mortgage loans   some mortgaged properties may not be readily convertible to alternative uses   certain mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans may have specialty use tenants and may not be readily convertible or convertible at all to alternative uses if those properties were to become unprofitable for any reason   for example retail mixeduse or office properties may have theater tenants properties with theater tenants are exposed to certain unique risks aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of a theater in addition decreasing attendance at a theater could adversely affect revenue of the theater which may in turn cause the tenant to experience financial difficulties resulting in downgrades in their credit ratings and in certain cases bankruptcy filings in addition because of unique construction requirements of theaters any vacant theater space would not easily be converted to other uses        retail mixeduse or office properties may also have health clubs as tenants several factors may adversely affect the value and successful operation of a health club including   ·the physical attributes of the health club eg its age appearance and layout   ·the reputation safety convenience and attractiveness of the property to users   ·management’s ability to control membership growth and attrition   ·competition in the tenant’s marketplace from other health clubs and alternatives to health clubs and   ·adverse changes in economic and social conditions and demographic changes eg population decreases or changes in average age or income which may result in decreased demand   in addition there may be significant costs associated with changing consumer preferences eg multipurpose clubs from singlepurpose clubs or varieties of equipment classes services and amenities in addition health clubs may not be readily convertible to alternative uses if those properties were to become unprofitable for any reason the liquidation value of any such health club consequently may be less than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to changing consumer preferences for other uses   certain retail mixed use or office properties may be partially comprised of a parking garage parking garages and parking lots present risks not associated with other properties the primary source of income for parking lots and garages is the rental fees charged for parking spaces   factors affecting the success of a parking lot or garage include   ·the number of rentable parking spaces and rates charged   ·the location of the lot or garage and in particular its proximity to places where large numbers of people work shop or live   ·the amount of alternative parking spaces in the area   ·the availability of mass transit and   ·the perceptions of the safety convenience and services of the lot or garage   aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of a parking garage facility site characteristics that are valuable to a parking garage facility include location clear ceiling heights column spacing zoning restrictions number of spaces and overall functionality and accessibility   in addition because of the unique construction requirements of many parking garages and because a parking lot is often vacant paved land without any structure a vacant parking garage facility or parking lot may not be easily converted to other uses   mortgaged properties may have other specialty use tenants such as medical and dental offices gas stations data centers urgent care facilities daycare centers andor restaurants as part of the mortgaged property   in the case of specialty use tenants such as restaurants and theaters aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of such properties and other retailers at the        mortgaged property decreasing patronage at such properties could adversely affect revenue of the property which may in turn cause the tenants to experience financial difficulties resulting in downgrades in their credit ratings lease defaults and in certain cases bankruptcy filings see “—tenant bankruptcy could result in a rejection of the related lease” above additionally receipts at such properties are also affected not only by objective factors but by subjective factors for instance restaurant receipts are affected by such varied influences as the current personal income levels in the community an individual consumer’s preference for type of food style of dining and restaurant atmosphere the perceived popularity of the restaurant food safety concerns related to personal health with the handling of food items at the restaurant or by food suppliers and the actions andor behaviors of staff and management and level of service to the customers in addition because of unique construction requirements of such properties any vacant space would not easily be converted to other uses   mortgaged properties with specialty use tenants may not be readily convertible or convertible at all to alternative uses if those properties were to become unprofitable or the leased spaces were to become vacant for any reason due to their unique construction requirements in addition converting commercial properties to alternate uses generally requires substantial capital expenditures and could result in a significant adverse effect on or interruption of the revenues generated by such properties   in addition a mortgaged property may not be readily convertible due to restrictive covenants related to such mortgaged property including in the case of mortgaged properties that are subject to a condominium regime or subject to a ground lease the use and other restrictions imposed by the condominium declaration and other related documents especially in a situation where a mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium regime see “—condominium ownership may limit use and improvements” above   some of the mortgaged properties may be part of taxreduction programs that apply only if the mortgaged properties are used for certain purposes such properties may be restricted from being converted to alternative uses because of such restrictions   some of the mortgaged properties have government tenants or other tenants which may have space that was “built to suit” that particular tenant’s uses and needs for example a government tenant may require enhanced security features that required additional construction or renovation costs and for which the related tenant may pay above market rent however such enhanced features may not be necessary for a new tenant and such new tenant may not be willing to pay the higher rent associated with such features while a government office building or government leased space may be usable as a regular office building or tenant space the rents that may be collected in the event the government tenant does not renew its lease may be significantly lower than the rent currently collected   additionally zoning historical preservation or other restrictions also may prevent alternative uses see “—risks related to zoning noncompliance and use restrictions” below   risks related to zoning noncompliance and use restrictions   certain of the mortgaged properties may not comply with current zoning laws including density use parking height landscaping open space and set back requirements due to changes in zoning requirements after such mortgaged properties were constructed these properties as well as those for which variances or special permits were issued or for which nonconformity with current zoning laws is otherwise permitted are considered to be a        “legal nonconforming use” andor the improvements are considered to be “legal nonconforming structures” this means that the borrower is not required to alter its structure to comply with the existing or new law however the borrower may not be able to rebuild the premises “asis” in the event of a substantial casualty loss this may adversely affect the cash flow of the property following the loss if a substantial casualty were to occur we cannot assure you that insurance proceeds would be available to pay the mortgage loan in full in addition if a nonconforming use were to be discontinued andor the property were repaired or restored in conformity with the current law the value of the property or the revenueproducing potential of the property may not be equal to that before the casualty   in addition certain of the mortgaged properties that do not conform to current zoning laws may not be “legal nonconforming uses” or “legal nonconforming structures” the failure of a mortgaged property to comply with zoning laws or to be a “legal nonconforming use” or “legal nonconforming structure” may adversely affect the market value of the mortgaged property or the borrower’s ability to continue to use it in the manner it is currently being used or may necessitate material additional expenditures to remedy nonconformities in some cases the related borrower has obtained law and ordinance insurance to cover additional costs that result from rebuilding the mortgaged property in accordance with current zoning requirements however if as a result of the applicable zoning laws the rebuilt improvements are smaller or less attractive to tenants than the original improvements the resulting loss in income will generally not be covered by law and ordinance insurance zoning protection insurance will generally reimburse the lender for the difference between i the mortgage loan balance on the date of damage loss to the mortgaged property from an insured peril and ii the total insurance proceeds at the time of the damage to the mortgaged property if such mortgaged property cannot be rebuilt to its former use due to new zoning ordinances   in addition certain of the mortgaged properties may be subject to certain use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to development agreements ground leases restrictive covenants reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or historical landmark designations or in the case of those mortgaged properties that are condominiums condominium declarations or other condominium use restrictions or regulations especially in a situation where the mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium building such use restrictions could include for example limitations on the character of the improvements or the properties limitations affecting noise and parking requirements among other things and limitations on the borrowers’ right to operate certain types of facilities within a prescribed radius these limitations impose upon the borrower stricter requirements with respect to repairs and alterations including following a casualty loss these limitations could adversely affect the ability of the related borrower to lease the mortgaged property on favorable terms thus adversely affecting the borrower’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the related mortgage loan in addition any alteration reconstruction demolition or new construction affecting a mortgaged property designated a historical landmark may require prior approval any such approval process even if successful could delay any redevelopment or alteration of a related property the liquidation value of such property to the extent subject to limitations of the kind described above or other limitations on convertibility of use may be substantially less than would be the case if such property was readily adaptable to other uses or redevelopment see “description of the mortgage pool—use restrictions” for examples of mortgaged properties that are subject to restrictions relating to the use of the mortgaged properties        risks relating to inspections of properties   licensed engineers or consultants inspected the mortgaged properties at or about the time of the origination of the mortgage loans to assess items such as structural integrity of the buildings and other improvements on the mortgaged property including exterior walls roofing interior construction mechanical and electrical systems and general condition of the site buildings and other improvements however we cannot assure you that all conditions requiring repair or replacement were identified no additional property inspections were conducted in connection with the issuance of the offered certificates   risks relating to costs of compliance with applicable laws and regulations   a borrower may be required to incur costs to comply with various existing and future federal state or local laws and regulations applicable to the related mortgaged property for example zoning laws and the americans with disabilities act of  as amended which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—americans with disabilities act” the expenditure of these costs or the imposition of injunctive relief penalties or fines in connection with the borrower’s noncompliance could negatively impact the borrower’s cash flow and consequently its ability to pay its mortgage loan   insurance may not be available or adequate   although the mortgaged properties are required to be insured or selfinsured by a sole tenant of a related building or group of buildings against certain risks there is a possibility of casualty loss with respect to the mortgaged properties for which insurance proceeds may not be adequate or which may result from risks not covered by insurance   in addition certain types of mortgaged properties such as manufactured housing and recreational vehicle communities have few or no insurable buildings or improvements and thus do not have casualty insurance or low limits of casualty insurance in comparison with the related mortgage loan balances   in addition hazard insurance policies will typically contain coinsurance clauses that in effect require an insured at all times to carry insurance of a specified percentage generally  to  of the full replacement value of the improvements on the related mortgaged property in order to recover the full amount of any partial loss as a result even if insurance coverage is maintained if the insured’s coverage falls below this specified percentage those clauses generally provide that the insurer’s liability in the event of partial loss does not exceed the lesser of  the replacement cost of the improvements less physical depreciation and  that proportion of the loss as the amount of insurance carried bears to the specified percentage of the full replacement cost of those improvements   certain of the mortgaged properties may be located in areas that are considered a high earthquake risk seismic zones  or  see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—geographic concentrations”   furthermore with respect to certain mortgage loans the insurable value of the related mortgaged property as of the origination date of the related mortgage loan was lower than the principal balance of the related mortgage loan in the event of a casualty when a borrower is not required to rebuild or cannot rebuild we cannot assure you that the insurance required with respect to the related mortgaged property will be sufficient to pay the related mortgage loan in full and there is no “gap” insurance required under such        mortgage loan to cover any difference in those circumstances a casualty that occurs near the maturity date may result in an extension of the maturity date of the mortgage loan if the special servicer in accordance with the servicing standard determines that such extension was in the best interest of certificateholders   the mortgage loans do not all require flood insurance on the related mortgaged properties unless they are in a flood zone and flood insurance is available and in certain instances even where the related mortgaged property was in a flood zone and flood insurance was available flood insurance was not required   we cannot assure you that the borrowers will in the future be able to comply with requirements to maintain adequate insurance with respect to the mortgaged properties and any uninsured loss could have a material adverse impact on the amount available to make payments on the related mortgage loan and consequently the offered certificates as with all real estate if reconstruction for example following fire or other casualty or any major repair or improvement is required to the damaged property changes in laws and governmental regulations may be applicable and may materially affect the cost to or ability of the borrowers to effect such reconstruction major repair or improvement as a result the amount realized with respect to the mortgaged properties and the amount available to make payments on the related mortgage loan and consequently the offered certificates could be reduced in addition we cannot assure you that the amount of insurance required or provided would be sufficient to cover damages caused by any casualty or that such insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates see representation and warranty no  on annex d to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on annex d to this prospectus subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to annex d to this prospectus   inadequacy of title insurers may adversely affect distributions on your certificates   title insurance for a mortgaged property generally insures a lender against risks relating to a lender not having a first lien with respect to a mortgaged property and in some cases can insure a lender against specific other risks the protection afforded by title insurance depends on the ability of the title insurer to pay claims made upon it we cannot assure you that with respect to any mortgage loan   ·a title insurer will have the ability to pay title insurance claims made upon it   ·the title insurer will maintain its present financial strength or   ·a title insurer will not contest claims made upon it   certain of the mortgaged properties are either completing initial construction or undergoing renovation or redevelopment under such circumstances there may be limitations to the amount of coverage or other exceptions to coverage that could adversely affect the issuing entity if losses are suffered   terrorism insurance may not be available for all mortgaged properties   the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks could  lead to damage to one or more of the mortgaged properties if any terrorist attacks occur or  result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for large properties which could adversely affect the cash flow at those mortgaged properties        after the september   terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area all forms of insurance were impacted particularly from a cost and availability perspective including comprehensive general liability and business interruption or rent loss insurance policies required by typical mortgage loans to give time for private markets to develop a pricing mechanism for terrorism risk and to build capacity to absorb future losses that may occur due to terrorism the terrorism risk insurance act of  was enacted on november   establishing the terrorism insurance program the terrorism insurance program was extended through december   by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  and was subsequently reauthorized on january   for a period of six years through december   pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  “tripra”   the terrorism insurance program requires insurance carriers to provide terrorism coverage in their basic “allrisk” policies any commercial property and casualty terrorism insurance exclusion that was in force on november   is automatically void to the extent that it excluded losses that would otherwise be insured losses any state approval of those types of exclusions in force on november   is also void   under the terrorism insurance program the federal government shares in the risk of losses occurring within the united states resulting from acts committed in an effort to influence or coerce united states civilians or the united states government the federal share of compensation for insured losses of an insurer equals  subject to annual  decreases beginning in  until such percentage equals  of the portion of such insured losses that exceed a deductible equal to  of the value of the insurer’s direct earned premiums over the calendar year immediately preceding that program year federal compensation in any program year is capped at  billion with insurers being liable for any amount that exceeds such cap and no compensation is payable with respect to a terrorist act unless the aggregate industry losses relating to such act exceed  million subject to annual  million increases beginning in  until such threshold equals  million the terrorism insurance program does not cover nuclear biological chemical or radiological attacks unless a borrower obtains separate coverage for events that do not meet the thresholds or other requirements above such events will not be covered   if the terrorism insurance program is not reenacted after its expiration in  premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and the terms of such insurance policies may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively not available in addition to the extent that any insurance policies contain “sunset clauses” ie clauses that void terrorism coverage if the federal insurance backstop program is not renewed then such policies may cease to provide terrorism insurance upon the expiration of the terrorism insurance program we cannot assure you that the terrorism insurance program or any successor program will create any long term changes in the availability and cost of such insurance moreover future legislation including regulations expected to be adopted by the treasury department pursuant to tripra may have a material effect on the availability of federal assistance in the terrorism insurance market to the extent that uninsured or underinsured casualty losses occur with respect to the related mortgaged properties losses on the mortgage loans may result in addition the failure to maintain such terrorism insurance may constitute a default under the related mortgage loan   some of the mortgage loans do not require the related borrower to maintain terrorism insurance in addition most of the mortgage loans contain limitations on the related borrower’s obligation to obtain terrorism insurance such as i waiving the requirement that such borrower maintain terrorism insurance if such insurance is not available at        commercially reasonable rates ii providing that the related borrower is not required to spend in excess of a specified dollar amount or in some cases a specified multiple of what is spent on other insurance in order to obtain such terrorism insurance iii requiring coverage only for as long as the tripra is in effect or iv requiring coverage only for losses arising from domestic acts of terrorism or from terrorist acts certified by the federal government as “acts of terrorism” under the tripra see annex a for a summary of the terrorism insurance requirements under each of the  largest mortgage loans or groups of crosscollateralized mortgage loans see representation and warranty no  on annex d to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on annex d to this prospectus subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to annex d to this prospectus   we cannot assure you that all of the mortgaged properties will be insured against the risks of terrorism and similar acts as a result of any of the foregoing the amount available to make distributions on your certificates could be reduced   other mortgaged properties securing mortgage loans may also be insured under a blanket policy or selfinsured or insured by a sole tenant see “—risks associated with blanket insurance policies or selfinsurance” below   risks associated with blanket insurance policies or selfinsurance   certain of the mortgaged properties are covered by blanket insurance policies which also cover other properties of the related borrower or its affiliates including certain properties in close proximity to the mortgaged properties in the event that such policies are drawn on to cover losses on such other properties the amount of insurance coverage available under such policies would thereby be reduced and could be insufficient to cover each mortgaged property’s insurable risks in addition with respect to some of the mortgaged properties a sole or significant tenant is allowed to provide selfinsurance against risks   additionally if the mortgage loans that allow coverage under blanket insurance policies are part of a group of mortgage loans with related borrowers then all of the related mortgaged properties may be covered under the same blanket policy which may also cover other properties owned by affiliates of such borrowers   certain mortgaged properties may also be insured or selfinsured by a sole or significant tenant as further described under “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—insurance considerations”   condemnation of a mortgaged property may adversely affect distributions on certificates   from time to time there may be condemnations pending or threatened against one or more of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans the proceeds payable in connection with a total condemnation may not be sufficient to restore the related mortgaged property or to satisfy the remaining indebtedness of the related mortgage loan the occurrence of a partial condemnation may have a material adverse effect on the continued use of or income generated by the affected mortgaged property therefore we cannot assure you that the occurrence of any condemnation will not have a negative impact upon distributions on your offered certificates        limited information causes uncertainty   historical information   some of the mortgage loans that we intend to include in the issuing entity are secured in whole or in part by mortgaged properties for which limited or no historical operating information is available as a result you may find it difficult to analyze the historical performance of those mortgaged properties   a mortgaged property may lack prior operating history or historical financial information because it is newly constructed or renovated it is a recent acquisition by the related borrower or it is a singletenant property that is subject to a triple net lease in addition a tenant’s lease may contain confidentiality provisions that restrict the sponsors’ access to or disclosure of such tenant’s financial information the underwritten net cash flows and underwritten net operating income for such mortgaged properties are derived principally from current rent rolls or tenant leases and historical expenses adjusted to account for inflation significant occupancy increases and a market rate management fee in some cases underwritten net cash flows and underwritten net operating income for mortgaged properties are based all or in part on leases or letters of intent that are not yet in place and may still be under negotiation or on tenants that may have signed a lease or letter of intent or lease amendment expanding the leased space but are not yet in occupancy andor paying rent which present certain risks described in “—underwritten net cash flow could be based on incorrect or failed assumptions” below   see annex a for certain historical financial information relating to the mortgaged properties including net operating income for the most recent reporting period and prior  calendar years to the extent available   ongoing information   the primary source of ongoing information regarding the offered certificates including information regarding the status of the related mortgage loans and any credit support for the offered certificates will be the periodic reports delivered to you see “description of the certificates—reports to certificateholders certain available information” we cannot assure you that any additional ongoing information regarding the offered certificates will be available through any other source the limited nature of the available information in respect of the offered certificates may adversely affect their liquidity even if a secondary market for the offered certificates does develop   we are not aware of any source through which pricing information regarding the offered certificates will be generally available on an ongoing basis or on any particular date   underwritten net cash flow could be based on incorrect or failed assumptions   as described under “description of the mortgage pool—additional information” underwritten net cash flow generally includes cash flow including any cash flow from master leases adjusted based on a number of assumptions used by the sponsors we make no representation that the underwritten net cash flow set forth in this prospectus as of the cutoff date or any other date represents actual future net cash flows for example with respect to certain mortgage loans included in the issuing entity the occupancy of the related mortgaged property reflects tenants that i may not have yet actually executed leases or letters of intent ii have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy andor are not paying full contractual rent iii are seeking or may in the future seek to sublet all        or a portion of their respective spaces iv are “dark” tenants but paying rent or v are affiliates of the related borrower and are leasing space pursuant to a master lease or a space lease similarly with respect to certain mortgage loans included in the issuing entity the underwritten net cash flow may be based on certain tenants that have not yet executed leases or that have signed leases but are not yet in place andor are not yet paying rent or have a signed lease or lease amendment expanding the leased space but are not yet in occupancy of all or a portion of their space andor paying rent or may assume that future contractual rent steps during some or all of the remaining term of a lease have occurred in many cases cotenancy provisions were assumed to be satisfied and vacant space was assumed to be occupied and space that was due to expire was assumed to have been relet in each case at market rates that may have exceeded current rent you should review these and other similar assumptions and make your own determination of the appropriate assumptions to be used in determining underwritten net cash flow   in addition underwritten or adjusted cash flows by their nature are speculative and are based upon certain assumptions and projections the failure of these assumptions or projections in whole or in part could cause the underwritten net operating income calculated as described in “description of the mortgage pool—additional information” to vary substantially from the actual net operating income of a mortgaged property   in the event of the inaccuracy of any assumptions or projections used in connection with the calculation of underwritten net cash flow the actual net cash flow could be significantly different and in some cases may be materially less than the underwritten net cash flow presented in this prospectus and this would change other numerical information presented in this prospectus based on or derived from the underwritten net cash flow such as the debt service coverage ratios or debt yield presented in this prospectus we cannot assure you that any such assumptions or projections made with respect to any mortgaged property will in fact be consistent with that mortgaged property’s actual performance   frequent and early occurrence of borrower delinquencies and defaults may adversely affect your investment   if you calculate the anticipated yield of your offered certificates based on a rate of default or amount of losses lower than that actually experienced on the mortgage loans and those additional losses result in a reduction of the total distributions on or the certificate balance of your offered certificates your actual yield to maturity will be lower than expected and could be negative under certain extreme scenarios the timing of any loss on a liquidated mortgage loan that results in a reduction of the total distributions on or the certificate balance of your offered certificates will also affect the actual yield to maturity of your offered certificates even if the rate of defaults and severity of losses are consistent with your expectations in general the earlier a loss is borne by you the greater the effect on your yield to maturity   delinquencies on the mortgage loans if the delinquent amounts are not advanced may result in shortfalls in distributions of interest andor principal to the holders of the offered certificates for the current month furthermore no interest will accrue on this shortfall during the period of time that the payment is delinquent additionally in instances where the principal portion of any balloon payment scheduled with respect to a mortgage loan is collected by the master servicer following the end of the related collection period no portion of the principal received on such payment will be passed through for distribution to the certificateholders until the subsequent distribution date which may result in shortfalls in distributions of interest to the holders of the offered certificates in the following month furthermore in such instances no provision is made for the master servicer or any other party to cover any such interest shortfalls that may occur as a result in addition if interest        andor principal advances andor servicing advances are made with respect to a mortgage loan after a default and the related mortgage loan is thereafter worked out under terms that do not provide for the repayment of those advances in full at the time of the workout then any reimbursements of those advances prior to the actual collection of the amount for which the advance was made may also result in shortfalls in distributions of principal to the holders of the offered certificates with certificate balances for the current month even if losses on the mortgage loans are not allocated to a particular class of offered certificates with certificate balances the losses may affect the weighted average life and yield to maturity of that class of offered certificates in the case of any material monetary or material nonmonetary default the special servicer may accelerate the maturity of the related mortgage loan which could result in an acceleration of principal distributions to the certificateholders the special servicer may also extend or modify a mortgage loan which could result in a substantial delay in principal distributions to the certificateholders in addition losses on the mortgage loans even if not allocated to a class of offered certificates with certificate balances may result in a higher percentage ownership interest evidenced by those offered certificates in the remaining mortgage loans than would otherwise have resulted absent the loss the consequent effect on the weighted average life and yield to maturity of the offered certificates will depend upon the characteristics of those remaining mortgage loans in the trust fund   the mortgage loans have not been reviewed or reunderwritten by us some mortgage loans may not have complied with another originator’s underwriting criteria   although the sponsors have conducted a review of the mortgage loans to be sold to us for this securitization transaction we as the depositor for this securitization transaction have neither originated the mortgage loans nor conducted a review or reunderwriting of the mortgage loans instead we have relied on the representations and warranties made by the applicable sponsors and the remedies for breach of a representation and warranty as described under “description of the mortgage loan purchase agreements” and the sponsor’s description of its underwriting criteria described under “transaction parties—the sponsors and mortgage loan sellers—wells fargo bank national association—wells fargo bank’s commercial mortgage loan underwriting” “—citigroup global markets realty corp—cgmrc’s underwriting guidelines and processes” “—ladder capital finance llc—ladder capital group’s underwriting guidelines and processes” “—principal commercial capital—principal commercial capital’s underwriting guidelines and processes” and “—société générale—société générale’s underwriting standards” a description of the review conducted by each sponsor for this securitization transaction is set forth under “transaction parties—the sponsors and mortgage loan sellers—wells fargo bank national association—review of mortgage loans for which wells fargo bank is the sponsor” “—citigroup global markets realty corp—review of cgmrc mortgage loans” “—ladder capital finance llc—review of lcf mortgage loans” “—principal commercial capital—review of pcc mortgage loans” and “—société générale—review of the mortgage loans for which société générale is the sponsor”   the representations and warranties made by the sponsors may not cover all of the matters that one would review in underwriting a mortgage loan and you should not view them as a substitute for reunderwriting the mortgage loans furthermore these representations and warranties in some respects represent an allocation of risk rather than a confirmed description of the mortgage loans if we had reunderwritten the mortgage loans it is possible that the reunderwriting process may have revealed problems with a mortgage loan not covered by a representation or warranty or may have revealed inaccuracies in the representations and warranties see “—other risks relating to the        certificates—sponsors may not make required repurchases or substitutions of defective mortgage loans or pay any loss of value payment sufficient to cover all losses on a defective mortgage loan” below and “description of the mortgage loan purchase agreements”   in addition we cannot assure you that all of the mortgage loans would have complied with the underwriting criteria of the other originators or accordingly that each originator would have made the same decision to originate every mortgage loan included in the issuing entity or if they did decide to originate an unrelated mortgage loan that they would have been underwritten on the same terms and conditions   as a result of the foregoing you are advised and encouraged to make your own investment decision based on a careful review of the information set forth in this prospectus and your own view of the mortgage pool   static pool data would not be indicative of the performance of this pool   as a result of the distinct nature of each pool of commercial mortgage loans and the separate mortgage loans within the pool this prospectus does not include disclosure concerning the delinquency and loss experience of static pools of periodic originations by any sponsor of assets of the type to be securitized known as “static pool data” in particular static pool data showing a low level of delinquencies and defaults would not be indicative of the performance of this pool or any other pools of mortgage loans originated by the same sponsor or sponsors   while there may be certain common factors affecting the performance and value of incomeproducing real properties in general those factors do not apply equally to all incomeproducing real properties and in many cases there are unique factors that will affect the performance andor value of a particular incomeproducing real property moreover the effect of a given factor on a particular real property will depend on a number of variables including but not limited to property type geographic location competition sponsorship and other characteristics of the property and the related commercial mortgage loan each incomeproducing real property represents a separate and distinct business venture and as a result each of the mortgage loans requires a unique underwriting analysis furthermore economic and other conditions affecting real properties whether worldwide national regional or local vary over time the performance of a pool of mortgage loans originated and outstanding under a given set of economic conditions may vary significantly from the performance of an otherwise comparable mortgage pool originated and outstanding under a different set of economic conditions   therefore you should evaluate this offering on the basis of the information set forth in this prospectus with respect to the mortgage loans and not on the basis of the performance of other pools of securitized commercial mortgage loans   appraisals may not reflect current or future market value of each property   appraisals were obtained with respect to each of the mortgaged properties at or about the time of origination of the related mortgage loan or whole loan if applicable or at or around the time of the acquisition of the mortgage loan or whole loan if applicable by the related sponsor see annex a for the dates of the latest appraisals for the mortgaged properties we have not obtained new appraisals of the mortgaged properties or assigned new valuations to the mortgage loans in connection with the offering of the offered certificates the market values of the mortgaged properties could have declined since the origination of the related mortgage loans        in general appraisals represent the analysis and opinion of qualified appraisers and are not guarantees of present or future value one appraiser may reach a different conclusion than that of a different appraiser with respect to the same property the appraisals seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller and in certain cases may have taken into consideration the purchase price paid by the borrower the amount could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a mortgaged property in a distress or liquidation sale   information regarding the appraised values of the mortgaged properties including loantovalue ratios presented in this prospectus is not intended to be a representation as to the past present or future market values of the mortgaged properties for example in some cases a borrower or its affiliate may have acquired the related mortgaged property for a price or otherwise for consideration in an amount that is less than the related appraised value specified on annex a including at a foreclosure sale or through acceptance of a deedinlieu of foreclosure historical operating results of the mortgaged properties used in these appraisals as adjusted by various assumptions estimates and subjective judgments on the part of the appraiser may not be comparable to future operating results in addition certain appraisals may be based on extraordinary assumptions including without limitation that certain tenants are inplace and paying rent when such tenants have not yet taken occupancy or that certain renovations or property improvement plans have been completed additionally certain appraisals with respect to mortgage loans secured by multiple mortgaged properties may have been conducted on a portfolio basis rather than on an individual property basis and the sum of the values of the individual properties may be different from and in some cases may be less than the appraised value of the aggregate of such properties on a portfolio basis in addition other factors may impair the mortgaged properties’ value without affecting their current net operating income including   ·changes in governmental regulations zoning or tax laws   ·potential environmental or other legal liabilities   ·the availability of refinancing and   ·changes in interest rate levels   in certain cases appraisals may reflect both “asstabilized” and “asis” values however the appraised value reflected in this prospectus with respect to each mortgaged property except as described under “description of the mortgage pool—certain calculations and definitions” reflects only the “asis” value or in certain cases may reflect the “asstabilized” value as a result of the satisfaction of the related conditions or assumptions unless otherwise specified which may contain certain assumptions such as future construction completion projected retenanting or increased tenant occupancies see “description of the mortgage pool—appraised value”   additionally with respect to the appraisals setting forth assumptions particularly those setting forth extraordinary assumptions as to the “asis” and “asstabilized” values we cannot assure you that those assumptions are or will be accurate or that the “asstabilized” value will be the value of the related mortgaged property at the indicated stabilization date or at maturity or anticipated repayment date any engineering report site inspection or appraisal represents only the analysis of the individual consultant engineer or inspector preparing such report at the time of such report and may not reveal all necessary or desirable repairs maintenance and capital improvement items see “transaction parties—the sponsors and mortgage loan sellers—wells fargo bank national association—wells        fargo bank’s commercial mortgage loan

“—principal commercial capital—principal commercial capital’s underwriting guidelines and processes” and “—société générale—société générale’s underwriting standards” for additional information regarding the appraisals we cannot assure you that the information set forth in this prospectus regarding the appraised values or loantovalue ratios accurately reflects past present or future market values of the mortgaged properties or the amount that would be realized upon a sale of the related mortgaged property   the performance of a mortgage loan and its related mortgaged property depends in part on who controls the borrower and mortgaged property   the operation and performance of a mortgage loan will depend in part on the identity of the persons or entities who control the borrower and the mortgaged property the performance of a mortgage loan may be adversely affected if control of a borrower changes which may occur for example by means of transfers of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower or if the mortgage loan is assigned to and assumed by another person or entity along with a transfer of the property to that person or entity   many of the mortgage loans generally place certain restrictions on the transfer andor pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower such as specific percentage or control limitations although some have current or permit future mezzanine or subordinate debt we cannot assure you the ownership of any of the borrowers would not change during the term of the related mortgage loan and result in a material adverse effect on your certificates see “description of the mortgage pool—additional indebtedness” and “—certain terms of the mortgage loans—’dueonsale’ and ‘dueonencumbrance’ provisions”   the borrower’s form of entity may cause special risks   the borrowers are legal entities rather than individuals mortgage loans made to legal entities may entail greater risks of loss than those associated with mortgage loans made to individuals for example a legal entity as opposed to an individual may be more inclined to seek legal protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy laws unlike individuals involved in bankruptcies most entities generally but not in all cases do not have personal assets and creditworthiness at stake   the terms of certain of the mortgage loans require that the borrowers be singlepurpose entities and in most cases such borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of the mortgage loans limit their activities to the ownership of only the related mortgaged property or mortgaged properties and limit the borrowers’ ability to incur additional indebtedness such provisions are designed to mitigate the possibility that the borrower’s financial condition would be adversely impacted by factors unrelated to the related mortgaged property and mortgage loan such borrower may also have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged property or may be a socalled “recycled” singlepurpose entity that previously had other business activities and liabilities however we cannot assure you that such borrowers have in the past complied or in the future will comply with such requirements additionally in some cases unsecured debt exists andor is allowed in the future furthermore in many cases such borrowers are not required to observe all covenants and conditions which typically are required in order for such borrowers to be viewed under standard rating agency criteria as “single purpose entities”        although a borrower may currently be a single purpose entity in certain cases the borrowers were not originally formed as single purpose entities but at origination of the related mortgage loan their organizational documents were amended such borrower may have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged property and may not have observed all covenants that typically are required to consider a borrower a “single purpose entity” and thus may have liabilities arising from events prior to becoming a single purpose entity   the organizational documents of a borrower or the direct or indirect managing partner or member of a borrower may also contain requirements that there be one or two independent directors managers or trustees depending on the entity form of such borrower whose vote is required before the borrower files a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or otherwise institutes insolvency proceedings generally but not always the independent directors managers or trustees may only be replaced with certain other independent successors although the requirement of having independent directors managers or trustees is designed to mitigate the risk of a voluntary bankruptcy filing by a solvent borrower a borrower could file for bankruptcy without obtaining the consent of its independent directors and we cannot assure you that such bankruptcy would be dismissed as an unauthorized filing and in any case the independent directors managers or trustees may determine that a bankruptcy filing is an appropriate course of action to be taken by such borrower although the independent directors managers or trustees generally owe no fiduciary duties to entities other than the borrower itself such determination might take into account the interests and financial condition of such borrower’s parent entities and such parent entities’ other subsidiaries in addition to those of the borrower consequently the financial distress of an affiliate of a borrower might increase the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing by a borrower   the bankruptcy of a borrower or a general partner or managing member of a borrower may impair the ability of the lender to enforce its rights and remedies under the related mortgage loan certain of the mortgage loans have been made to single purpose limited partnerships that have a general partner or general partners that are not themselves single purpose entities such loans are subject to additional bankruptcy risk the organizational documents of the general partner in such cases do not limit it to acting as the general partner of the partnership accordingly there is a greater risk that the general partner may become insolvent for reasons unrelated to the mortgaged property the bankruptcy of a general partner may dissolve the partnership under applicable state law in addition even if the partnership itself is not insolvent actions by the partnership andor a bankrupt general partner that are outside the ordinary course of their business such as refinancing the related mortgage loan may require prior approval of the bankruptcy court in the general partner’s bankruptcy case the proceedings required to resolve these issues may be costly and timeconsuming   any borrower even an entity structured as a single purpose entity as an owner of real estate will be subject to certain potential liabilities and risks as an owner of real estate we cannot assure you that any borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower or a corporate or individual general partner or managing member of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against such borrower or corporate or individual general partner or managing member   certain borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of certain mortgage loans permit an affiliated property manager to maintain a custodial account on behalf of such borrower and certain affiliates of such borrower into which funds available to such borrower under the terms of the related mortgage loans and funds of such affiliates are held but which funds are and will continue to be separately accounted for as to each item of income        and expense for each related mortgaged property and each related borrower a custodial account structure for affiliated entities while common among certain reits institutions or independent owners of multiple properties presents a risk for consolidation of the assets of such affiliates as commingling of funds is a factor a court may consider in considering a request by other creditors for substantive consolidation substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy that could result in an otherwise solvent company becoming subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of an insolvent affiliate making its assets available to repay the debts of affiliated companies a court has the discretion to order substantive consolidation in whole or in part and may include nondebtor affiliates of the bankrupt entity in the proceedings in particular consolidation may be ordered when corporate funds are commingled and used for a principal’s personal purposes inadequate records of transfers are made and corporate entities are deemed an alter ego of a principal strict adherence to maintaining separate books and records avoiding commingling of assets and otherwise maintaining corporate policies designed to preserve the separateness of corporate assets and liabilities make it less likely that a court would order substantive consolidation but we cannot assure you that the related borrowers property managers or affiliates will comply with these requirements as set forth in the related mortgage loans   furthermore with respect to any affiliated borrowers creditors of a common parent in bankruptcy may seek to consolidate the assets of such borrowers with those of the parent consolidation of the assets of such borrowers would likely have an adverse effect on the funds available to make distributions on your certificates and may lead to a downgrade withdrawal or qualification of the ratings of your certificates   see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans—single purpose entity covenants” and “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws”   in addition borrowers may own a mortgaged property as a delaware statutory trust or as tenantsincommon delaware statutory trusts may be restricted in their ability to actively operate a property and in the case of a mortgaged property that is owned by a delaware statutory trust or by tenants in common there is a risk that obtaining the consent of the holders of the beneficial interests in the delaware statutory trust or the consent of the tenants in common will be time consuming and cause delays with respect to the taking of certain actions by or on behalf of the borrower including with respect to the related mortgaged property see “—tenancies in common may hinder recovery” below see also “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics—tenancies in common crowd funding” in this prospectus   in addition certain of the mortgage loans may have borrowers that are wholly or partially directly or indirectly owned by one or more crowd funding investor groups investments in the commercial real estate market through crowd funding investor groups are a relatively recent development and there may be certain unanticipated risks to this new ownership structure which may adversely affect the related mortgage loan typically the crowd funding investor group is made up of a large number of individual investors who invest relatively small amounts in the group pursuant to a securities offering with respect to an equity investment in the borrower the crowd funding investor group in turn purchases a stake in the borrower accordingly equity in the borrower is indirectly held by the individual investors in the crowd funding group we cannot assure you that either the crowd funding investor group or the individual investors in the crowd funding investor group have relevant expertise in the commercial real estate market additionally crowd funding investor groups are required to comply with various securities regulations related to offerings of securities and we cannot assure you that any enforcement action or legal proceeding regarding failure to comply with such securities regulations would not delay        enforcement of the related mortgage loan furthermore we cannot assure you that a bankruptcy proceeding by the crowd

investment” and “—the performance of a mortgage loan and its related mortgaged property depends in part on who controls the borrower and mortgaged property”   a bankruptcy proceeding may result in losses and delays in realizing on the mortgage loans   numerous statutory provisions including the federal bankruptcy code and state laws affording relief to debtors may interfere with and delay the ability of a secured mortgage lender to obtain payment of a loan to realize upon collateral andor to enforce a deficiency judgment for example under the federal bankruptcy code virtually all actions including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment proceedings are automatically stayed upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition and often no interest or principal payments are made during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding also under federal bankruptcy law the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior lien holder may stay the senior lender from taking action to foreclose out such junior lien certain of the mortgage loans have sponsors that have previously filed bankruptcy and we cannot assure you that such sponsors will not be more likely than other sponsors to utilize their rights in bankruptcy in the event of any threatened action by the mortgagee to enforce its rights under the related mortgage loan documents as a result the issuing entity’s recovery with respect to borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings may be significantly delayed and the aggregate amount ultimately collected may be substantially less than the amount owed see “—other financings or ability to incur other indebtedness entails risk” below “description of the mortgage pool—loan purpose default history bankruptcy issues and other proceedings” and “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws”   additionally the courts of any state may refuse the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust when an acceleration of the indebtedness would be inequitable or unjust or the circumstances would render the action unconscionable see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—foreclosure”   see also “—performance of the mortgage loan will be highly dependent on the performance of tenants and tenant leases—tenant bankruptcy could result in a rejection of the related lease” above   litigation regarding the mortgaged properties or borrowers may impair your distributions   there may be and there may exist from time to time pending or threatened legal proceedings against or disputes with the borrowers the borrower sponsors the managers of the mortgaged properties and their respective affiliates arising out of their ordinary business we have not undertaken a search for all legal proceedings that relate to the borrowers borrower sponsors managers for the mortgaged properties or their respective affiliates potential investors are advised and encouraged to perform their own searches related to such matters to the extent relevant to their investment decision any such litigation or dispute may materially impair distributions to certificateholders if borrowers must use property income to pay judgments legal fees or litigation costs we cannot assure you that any litigation or dispute or any settlement of any litigation or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on your investment        additionally a borrower or a principal of a borrower or affiliate may have been a party to a bankruptcy foreclosure litigation or other proceeding particularly against a lender or may have been convicted of a crime in the past in addition certain of the borrower sponsors property managers affiliates of any of the foregoing andor entities controlled thereby have been a party to bankruptcy proceedings mortgage loan defaults and restructures discounted payoffs foreclosure proceedings or deedinlieu of foreclosure transactions or other material proceedings including criminal proceedings in the past whether or not related to the mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan in this securitization transaction in some cases mortgaged properties securing certain of the mortgage loans previously secured other loans that had been in default restructured or the subject of a discounted payoff foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure   certain of the borrower sponsors may have a history of litigation or other proceedings against their lender in some cases involving various parties to a securitization transaction we cannot assure you that the borrower sponsors that have engaged in litigation or other proceedings in the past will not commence action against the issuing entity in the future upon any attempt by the special servicer to enforce the mortgage loan documents any such actions by the borrower or borrower sponsor may result in significant expense and potential loss to the issuing entity and a shortfall in funds available to make payments on the offered certificates in addition certain principals or borrower sponsors may have in the past been convicted of or pled guilty to a felony we cannot assure you that the borrower or principal will not be more likely than other borrowers or principals to avail itself or cause a borrower to avail itself of its legal rights under the federal bankruptcy code or otherwise in the event of an action or threatened action by the lender or its servicer to enforce the related mortgage loan documents or otherwise conduct its operations in a manner that is in the best interests of the lender andor the mortgaged property we cannot assure you that any such proceedings or actions will not have a material adverse effect upon distributions on your certificates further borrowers principals of borrowers property managers and affiliates of such parties may in the future be involved in bankruptcy proceedings foreclosure proceedings or other material proceedings including criminal proceedings whether or not related to the mortgage loans we cannot assure you that any such proceedings will not negatively impact a borrower’s or borrower sponsor’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan and as a result could have a material adverse effect upon your certificates   often it is difficult to confirm the identity of owners of all of the equity in a borrower which means that past issues may not be discovered as to such owners see “description of the mortgage pool—litigation and other considerations” and “—loan purpose default history bankruptcy issues and other proceedings” for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the issuing entity however we cannot assure you that there are no undisclosed bankruptcy proceedings foreclosure proceedings deedinlieuofforeclosure transaction andor mortgage loan workout matters that involved one or more mortgage loans or mortgaged properties andor a guarantor borrower sponsor or other party to a mortgage loan   in addition in the event the owner of a borrower experiences financial problems we cannot assure you that such owner would not attempt to take actions with respect to the mortgaged property that may adversely affect the borrower’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the related mortgage loan see “description of the mortgage pool—litigation and other considerations” for information regarding litigation matters with respect to certain mortgage loans        other financings or ability to incur other indebtedness entails risk   when a borrower or its constituent members also has one or more other outstanding loans even if they are pari passu subordinated mezzanine preferred equity or unsecured loans or another type of equity pledge the issuing entity is subjected to additional risk such as   ·the borrower or its constituent members may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple financings   ·the existence of other financings will generally also make it more difficult for the borrower to obtain refinancing of the related mortgage loan or whole loan if applicable or sell the related mortgaged property and may thereby jeopardize repayment of the mortgage loan or whole loan if applicable   ·the need to service additional financings may reduce the cash flow available to the borrower to operate and maintain the mortgaged property and the value of the mortgaged property may decline as a result   ·if a borrower or its constituent members defaults on its mortgage loan andor any other financing actions taken by other lenders such as a suit for collection foreclosure or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy against the borrower could impair the security available to the issuing entity including the mortgaged property or stay the issuing entity’s ability to foreclose during the course of the bankruptcy case   ·the bankruptcy of another lender also may operate to stay foreclosure by the issuing entity and   ·the issuing entity may also be subject to the costs and administrative burdens of involvement in foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings or related litigation   although the companion loans related to the whole loans are not assets of the issuing entity each related borrower is still obligated to make interest and principal payments on such companion loans as a result the issuing entity is subject to additional risks including   ·the risk that the necessary maintenance of the related mortgaged property could be deferred to allow the borrower to pay the required debt service on these other obligations and that the value of the mortgaged property may fall as a result and   ·the risk that it may be more difficult for the borrower to refinance these loans or to sell the related mortgaged property for purposes of making any balloon payment on the entire balance of such loans and the related additional debt at maturity or anticipated repayment date   with respect to mezzanine financing if any while a mezzanine lender has no security interest in the related mortgaged properties a default under a mezzanine loan could cause a change in control of the related borrower with respect to mortgage loans that permit mezzanine financing the relative rights of the mortgagee and the related mezzanine lender will generally be set forth in an intercreditor agreement which agreements typically provide that the rights of the mezzanine lender including the right to payment against the borrower and mortgaged property are subordinate to the rights of the mortgage lender and that the mezzanine lender may not take any enforcement action against the mortgage borrower and mortgaged property        in addition the mortgage loan documents related to certain mortgage loans may have or permit future “preferred equity” structures where one or more special limited partners or members receive a preferred return in exchange for an infusion of capital or other type of equity pledge that may require payments of a specified return or of excess cash flow such arrangements can present risks that resemble mezzanine debt including dilution of the borrower’s equity in the mortgaged property stress on the cash flow in the form of a preferred return or excess cash payments andor potential changes in the management of the related mortgaged property in the event the preferred return is not satisfied   additionally the terms of certain mortgage loans permit or require the borrowers to post letters of credit andor surety bonds for the benefit of the related mortgage loan which may constitute a contingent reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate the issuing bank or surety will not typically agree to subordination and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee   in addition borrowers under most of the mortgage loans are generally permitted to incur trade payables and equipment financing which may not be limited or may be significant in order to operate the related mortgaged properties also with respect to certain mortgage loans the related borrower either has incurred or is permitted to incur unsecured debt from an affiliate of either the borrower or the sponsor of the borrower see “description of the mortgage pool—additional indebtedness—other unsecured indebtedness”   for additional information see “description of the mortgage pool—additional indebtedness” and “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing of the nonserviced mortgage loans”   tenanciesincommon may hinder recovery   certain of the mortgage loans included in the issuing entity have borrowers that own the related mortgaged properties as tenantsincommon in general with respect to a tenantincommon ownership structure each tenantincommon owns an undivided share in the property and if such tenantincommon desires to sell its interest in the property and is unable to find a buyer or otherwise needs to force a partition the tenantincommon has the ability to request that a court order a sale of the property and distribute the proceeds to each tenant in common proportionally as a result if a tenantincommon that has not waived its right of partition or similar right exercises a right of partition the related mortgage loan may be subject to prepayment the bankruptcy dissolution or action for partition by one or more of the tenantsincommon could result in an early repayment of the related mortgage loan significant delay in recovery against the tenantincommon borrowers particularly if the tenantincommon borrowers file for bankruptcy separately or in series because each time a tenantincommon borrower files for bankruptcy the bankruptcy court stay will be reinstated a material impairment in property management and a substantial decrease in the amount recoverable upon the related mortgage loan not all tenantsincommon under the mortgage loans will be single purpose entities each tenantincommon borrower has waived its right to partition reducing the risk of partition however we cannot assure you that if challenged this waiver would be enforceable in addition in some cases the related mortgage loan documents may provide for full recourse or in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the debt to the related tenantincommon borrower or the guarantor if a tenantincommon files for partition        risks relating to enforceability of crosscollateralization   crosscollateralization arrangements may be terminated in certain circumstances under the terms of the related mortgage loan documents crosscollateralization arrangements whereby multiple borrowers grant their respective mortgaged properties as security for one or more mortgage loans could be challenged as fraudulent conveyances by the creditors or the bankruptcy estate of any of the related borrowers   among other things a legal challenge to the granting of the liens may focus on the benefits realized by that borrower from the respective mortgage loan proceeds as well as the overall crosscollateralization if a court were to conclude that the granting of the liens was an avoidable fraudulent conveyance that court could subordinate all or part of the mortgage loan to other debt of that borrower recover prior payments made on that mortgage loan or take other actions such as invalidating the mortgage loan or the mortgages securing the crosscollateralization see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws”   in addition when multiple real properties secure a mortgage loan the amount of the mortgage encumbering any particular one of those properties may be less than the full amount of the related aggregate mortgage loan indebtedness to minimize recording tax this mortgage amount is generally established at  to  of the appraised value or allocated loan amount for the mortgaged property and will limit the extent to which proceeds from the property will be available to offset declines in value of the other properties securing the same mortgage loan   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics” for a description of any mortgage loans that are crosscollateralized and crossdefaulted with each other or that are secured by multiple properties owned by multiple borrowers   risks relating to enforceability of yield maintenance charges prepayment premiums or defeasance provisions   provisions requiring yield maintenance charges prepayment premiums or lockout periods may not be enforceable in some states and under federal bankruptcy law provisions requiring prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges also may be interpreted as constituting the collection of interest for usury purposes accordingly we cannot assure you that the obligation to pay a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable also we cannot assure you that foreclosure proceeds will be sufficient to pay an enforceable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium   additionally although the collateral substitution provisions related to defeasance do not have the same effect on the certificateholders as prepayment we cannot assure you that a court would not interpret those provisions as the equivalent of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium in certain jurisdictions those collateral substitution provisions might therefore be deemed unenforceable or usurious under applicable law or public policy   risks associated with one action rules   several states such as california have laws that prohibit more than one “judicial action” to enforce a mortgage obligation and some courts have construed the term “judicial action” broadly accordingly the special servicer will be required to obtain advice of counsel prior to enforcing any of the issuing entity’s rights under any of the mortgage loans that include mortgaged properties where a “one action” rule could be applicable in the case of a multi property mortgage loan which is secured by mortgaged properties located in multiple        states the special servicer may be required to foreclose first on properties located in states where “one action” rules apply and where nonjudicial foreclosure is permitted before foreclosing on properties located in states where judicial foreclosure is the only permitted method of foreclosure see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—foreclosure”   state law limitations on assignments of leases and rents may entail risks   generally mortgage loans included in an issuing entity secured by mortgaged properties that are subject to leases typically will be secured by an assignment of leases and rents pursuant to which the related borrower or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure the related property owner assigns to the lender its right title and interest as landlord under the leases of the related mortgaged properties and the income derived from those leases as further security for the related mortgage loan while retaining a license to collect rents for so long as there is no default if the borrower defaults the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect rents some state laws may require that the lender take possession of the related property and obtain a judicial appointment of a receiver before becoming entitled to collect the rents in addition if bankruptcy or similar proceedings are commenced by or in respect of the borrower the lender’s ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—leases and rents” and “—bankruptcy laws”   various other laws could affect the exercise of lender’s rights   the laws of the jurisdictions in which the mortgaged properties are located which laws may vary substantially govern many of the legal aspects of the mortgage loans these laws may affect the ability to foreclose on and in turn the ability to realize value from the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans for example state law determines   ·what proceedings are required for foreclosure   ·whether the borrower and any foreclosed junior lienors may redeem the property and the conditions under which these rights of redemption may be exercised   ·whether and to what extent recourse to the borrower is permitted and   ·what rights junior mortgagees have and whether the amount of fees and interest that lenders may charge is limited   in addition the laws of some jurisdictions may render certain provisions of the mortgage loans unenforceable or subject to limitations which may affect lender’s rights under the mortgage loans delays in liquidations of defaulted mortgage loans and shortfalls in amounts realized upon liquidation as a result of the application of these laws may create delays and shortfalls in payments to certificateholders see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans”   risks of anticipated repayment date loans   certain of the mortgage loans provide that if after a certain date referred to as the anticipated repayment date the related borrower has not prepaid the mortgage loan in full any principal outstanding after that anticipated repayment date will accrue interest at an increased interest rate rather than the stated mortgage loan rate generally from and after the anticipated repayment date cash flow in excess of that required for debt service the funding of reserves and certain approved operating expenses with respect to the related mortgaged property will be applied toward the payment of principal without payment of a        yield maintenance charge of the related mortgage loan until its principal balance has been reduced to zero although these provisions may create an incentive for the borrower to repay the mortgage loan in full on its anticipated repayment date a substantial payment would be required and the borrower has no obligation to do so while interest at the initial mortgage rate continues to accrue and be payable on a current basis on this mortgage loan after its anticipated repayment date the payment of excess interest will be deferred and will be required to be paid only after the outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage loan has been paid in full at which time the excess interest that has been deferred to the extent actually collected will be paid to the holders of the class v certificates which are not offered by this prospectus see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans—ard loan”   the absence of lockboxes entails risks that could adversely affect distributions on your certificates   certain of the mortgage loans may not require the related borrower to cause rent and other payments to be made into a lockbox account maintained on behalf of the mortgagee although some of those mortgage loans do provide for a springing lockbox if rental payments are not required to be made directly into a lockbox account there is a risk that the borrower will divert such funds for other purposes   borrower may be unable to repay remaining principal balance on maturity date or anticipated repayment date longer amortization schedules and interestonly provisions increase risk   mortgage loans with substantial remaining principal balances at their stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable involve greater risk than fullyamortizing mortgage loans because the borrower may be unable to repay the mortgage loan at that time in addition fully amortizing mortgage loans which may pay interest on an “actual” basis but have fixed monthly payments may in effect have a small balloon payment due at maturity or anticipated repayment date   all of the mortgage loans have amortization schedules that are significantly longer than their respective terms to maturity or anticipated repayment date as applicable and many of the mortgage loans require only payments of interest for part or all of their respective terms see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans—due dates mortgage rates calculations of interest” a longer amortization schedule or an interestonly provision in a mortgage loan will result in a higher amount of principal outstanding under the mortgage loan at any particular time including at the maturity date of the mortgage loan than would have otherwise been the case had a shorter amortization schedule been used or had the mortgage loan had a shorter interestonly period or not included an interestonly provision at all that higher principal amount outstanding could both i make it more difficult for the related borrower to make the required balloon payment at maturity or anticipated repayment date and ii lead to increased losses for the issuing entity either during the loan term or at maturity or anticipated repayment date if the mortgage loan becomes a defaulted mortgage loan   a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loan on its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the mortgaged property at a price sufficient to permit repayment a borrower’s ability to achieve either of these goals will be affected by a number of factors including        ·the availability of and competition for credit for commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community real estate projects which fluctuate over time   ·the prevailing interest rates   ·the net operating income generated by the mortgaged property   ·the fair market value of the related mortgaged property   ·the borrower’s equity in the related mortgaged property   ·significant tenant rollover at the related mortgaged properties see “—retail properties have special risks” and “—office properties have special risks” above   ·the borrower’s financial condition   ·the operating history and occupancy level of the mortgaged property   ·reductions in applicable government assistancerent subsidy programs   ·the tax laws and   ·prevailing general and regional economic conditions   with respect to any mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan the risks relating to balloon payment obligations are enhanced by the existence and amount of the related companion loans   none of the sponsors any party to the pooling and servicing agreement or any other person will be under any obligation to refinance any mortgage loan however in order to maximize recoveries on defaulted mortgage loans the pooling and servicing agreement permits the special servicer and the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced whole loan may permit the related special servicer to extend and modify mortgage loans in a manner consistent with the servicing standard subject to the limitations described under “pooling and servicing agreement—realization upon mortgage loans” and “—modifications waivers and amendments”   neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will have the ability to extend or modify a nonserviced mortgage loan because such mortgage loan is being serviced by a master servicer or special servicer pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of the applicable nonserviced whole loan see “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing of the nonserviced mortgage loans”   we cannot assure you that any extension or modification will increase the present value of recoveries in a given case whether or not losses are ultimately sustained any delay in collection of a balloon payment that would otherwise be distributable on your certificates whether such delay is due to borrower default or to modification of the related mortgage loan will likely extend the weighted average life of your certificates   in any event we cannot assure you that each borrower under a balloon loan will have the ability to repay the principal balance of such mortgage loan on the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable   see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics”        risks related to ground leases and other leasehold interests   with respect to certain mortgaged properties the encumbered interest will be characterized as a “fee interest” if i the borrower has a fee interest in all or substantially all of the mortgaged property provided that if the borrower has a leasehold interest in any portion of the mortgaged property such portion is not material to the use or operation of the mortgaged property or ii the mortgage loan is secured by the borrower’s leasehold interest in the mortgaged property as well as the borrower’s or other fee owner’s overlapping fee interest in the related mortgaged property   leasehold mortgage loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower the most significant of these risks is that if the related borrower’s leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default the lender would lose its security in the leasehold interest generally each related ground lease or a lessor estoppel requires the lessor to give the lender notice of the borrower’s defaults under the ground lease and an opportunity to cure them permits the leasehold interest to be assigned to the lender or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale in some cases only upon the consent of the lessor and contains certain other protective provisions typically included in a “mortgageable” ground lease although not all these protective provisions are included in each case   upon the bankruptcy of a lessor or a lessee under a ground lease the debtor has the right to assume or reject the lease if a debtor lessor rejects the lease the lessee has the right pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code to treat such lease as terminated by rejection or remain in possession of its leased premises for the rent otherwise payable under the lease for the remaining term of the ground lease including renewals and to offset against such rent any damages incurred due to the landlord’s failure to perform its obligations under the lease if a debtor lesseeborrower rejects any or all of the lease the leasehold lender could succeed to the lesseeborrower’s position under the lease only if the lease specifically grants the lender such right if both the lessor and the lesseeborrower are involved in bankruptcy proceedings the issuing entity may be unable to enforce the bankrupt lesseeborrower’s prepetition agreement to refuse to treat a ground lease rejected by a bankrupt lessor as terminated in such circumstances a ground lease could be terminated notwithstanding lender protection provisions contained in the ground lease or in the mortgage   some of the ground leases securing the mortgage loans may provide that the ground rent payable under the related ground lease increases during the term of the mortgage loan these increases may adversely affect the cash flow and net income of the related borrower   a leasehold lender could lose its security unless i the leasehold lender holds a fee mortgage ii the ground lease requires the lessor to enter into a new lease with the leasehold lender upon termination or rejection of the ground lease or iii the bankruptcy court as a court of equity allows the leasehold lender to assume the ground lessee’s obligations under the ground lease and succeed to the ground lessee’s position although not directly covered by the  amendments to the federal bankruptcy code such a result would be consistent with the purpose of the  amendments to the federal bankruptcy code granting the holders of leasehold mortgages permitted under the terms of the lease the right to succeed to the position of a leasehold mortgagor although consistent with the federal bankruptcy code such position may not be adopted by the applicable bankruptcy court        further in a decision by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit precision indus v qualitech steel sbq llc  fd  th cir  the court ruled with respect to an unrecorded lease of real property that where a statutory sale of the fee interest in leased property occurs under the federal bankruptcy code upon the bankruptcy of a landlord such sale terminates a lessee’s possessory interest in the property and the purchaser assumes title free and clear of any interest including any leasehold estates pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code a lessee may request the bankruptcy court to prohibit or condition the statutory sale of the property so as to provide adequate protection of the leasehold interest however the court ruled that this provision does not ensure continued possession of the property but rather entitles the lessee to compensation for the value of its leasehold interest typically from the sale proceeds while there are certain circumstances under which a “free and clear” sale under the federal bankruptcy code would not be authorized including that the lessee could not be compelled in a legal or equitable proceeding to accept a monetary satisfaction of his possessory interest and that none of the other conditions of the federal bankruptcy code otherwise permits the sale we cannot assure you that those circumstances would be present in any proposed sale of a leased premises as a result we cannot assure you that in the event of a statutory sale of leased property pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code the lessee will be able to maintain possession of the property under the ground lease in addition we cannot assure you that the lessee andor the lender will be able to recoup the full value of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy court most of the ground leases contain standard protections typically obtained by securitization lenders certain of the ground leases with respect to a mortgage loan included in the issuing entity may not see also representation and warranty no  on annex d to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on annex d to this prospectus subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to annex d to this prospectus   except as noted in this prospectus each of the ground leases has a term that extends at least  years beyond the maturity date of the mortgage loan taking into account all freely exercisable extension options and contains customary mortgagee protection provisions including notice and cure rights and the right to enter into a new lease with the applicable ground lessor in the event a ground lease is rejected or terminated   with respect to certain of the mortgage loans the related borrower may have given to certain lessors under the related ground lease a right of first refusal in the event a sale is contemplated or an option to purchase all or a portion of the mortgaged property and these provisions if not waived may impede the mortgagee’s ability to sell the related mortgaged property at foreclosure or adversely affect the foreclosure process   see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans—bankruptcy laws”   leased fee properties have special risks   land subject to a ground lease presents special risks in such cases where the borrower owns the fee interest but not the related improvements such borrower will only receive the rental income from the ground lease and not from the operation of any related improvements any default by the ground lessee would adversely affect the borrower’s ability to make payments on the related mortgage loan while ground leases may contain certain restrictions on the use and operation of the related mortgaged property the ground lessee generally enjoys the rights and privileges of a fee owner including the right to construct alter and remove improvements and fixtures from the land and to assign and sublet the ground leasehold interest however the borrower has the same risk of interruptions in cash flow if such ground lessee defaults under its lease as it would on another single tenant commercial property without the control over the premises that it        would ordinarily have as landlord in addition in the event of a condemnation the borrower would only be entitled to an allocable share of the condemnation proceeds furthermore the insurance requirements are often governed by the terms of the ground lease and in some cases certain tenants or subtenants may be allowed to selfinsure the ground lessee is commonly permitted to mortgage its ground leasehold interest and the leasehold lender will often have notice and cure rights with respect to material defaults under the ground lease in addition leased fee interests are less frequently purchased and sold than other interests in commercial real property it may be difficult for the issuing entity if it became a foreclosing lender to sell the fee interests if the tenant and its improvements remain on the land in addition if the improvements are nearing the end of their useful life there could be a risk that the tenant defaults in lieu of performing any obligations it may otherwise have to raze the structure and return the land in raw form to the developer furthermore leased fee interests are generally subject to the same risks associated with the property type of the ground lessee’s use of the premises because that use is a source of revenue for the payment of ground rent   increases in real estate taxes may reduce available funds   certain of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans have or may in the future have the benefit of reduced real estate taxes in connection with a local government “payment in lieu of taxes” program or other tax abatement arrangements upon expiration of such program or if such programs were otherwise terminated the related borrower would be required to pay higher and in some cases substantially higher real estate taxes prior to expiration of such program the tax benefit to the mortgaged property may decrease throughout the term of the expiration date until the expiration of such program an increase in real estate taxes may impact the ability of the borrower to pay debt service on the mortgage loan   see “description of the mortgage pool—real estate and other tax considerations” for descriptions of real estate tax matters relating to certain mortgaged properties   state and local mortgage recording taxes may apply upon a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and reduce net proceeds   many jurisdictions impose recording taxes on mortgages which if not paid at the time of the recording of the mortgage may impair the ability of the lender to foreclose the mortgage such taxes interest and penalties could be significant in amount and would if imposed reduce the net proceeds realized by the issuing entity in liquidating the real property securing the related mortgage loan   risks related to conflicts of interest   interests and incentives of the originators the sponsors and their affiliates may not be aligned with your interests   the originators the sponsors and their affiliates including certain of the underwriters expect to derive ancillary benefits from this offering and their respective incentives may not be aligned with those of purchasers of the offered certificates the sponsors originated or purchased the mortgage loans in order to securitize the mortgage loans by means of a transaction such as the offering of the offered certificates the sponsors will sell the mortgage loans to the depositor an affiliate of wells fargo bank national association one of the sponsors and originators the master servicer the certificate administrator and of wells fargo securities llc one of the underwriters on the closing date in exchange for cash derived from the sale of the offered certificates to investors andor in exchange for        offered certificates a completed offering would reduce the originators’ exposure to the mortgage loans the originators made the mortgage loans with a view toward securitizing them and distributing the exposure by means of a transaction such as this offering of offered certificates in addition certain mortgaged properties may have tenants that are affiliated with the related originator see “description of the mortgage pool—tenant issues—affiliated leases” this offering of offered certificates will effectively transfer the originators’ exposure to the mortgage loans to purchasers of the offered certificates   the originators the sponsors and their affiliates expect to receive various benefits including compensation commissions payments rebates remuneration and business opportunities in connection with or as a result of this offering of offered certificates and their interests in the mortgage loans the sponsors and their affiliates will effectively receive compensation and may record a profit in an amount based on among other things the amount of proceeds net of transaction expenses received from the sale of the offered certificates to investors relative to their investment in the mortgage loans the benefits to the originators the sponsors and their affiliates arising from the decision to securitize the mortgage loans may be greater than they would have been had other assets been selected   furthermore the sponsors andor their affiliates may benefit from a completed offering of the offered certificates because the offering would establish a market precedent and a valuation data point for securities similar to the offered certificates thus enhancing the ability of the sponsors and their affiliates to conduct similar offerings in the future and permitting them to adjust the fair value of the mortgage loans or other similar assets or securities held on their balance sheet including increasing the carrying value or avoiding decreasing the carrying value of some or all of such similar positions   in some cases the originators or their affiliates are the holders of the mezzanine loans andor companion loans related to their mortgage loans the originators andor their respective affiliates may retain existing mezzanine loans andor companion loans or originate future permitted mezzanine indebtedness with respect to the mortgage loans these transactions may cause the originators and their affiliates or their clients or counterparties who purchase the mezzanine loans andor companion loans as applicable to have economic interests and incentives that do not align with and that may be directly contrary to those of an investor in the offered certificates in addition these transactions or actions taken to maintain adjust or unwind any positions in the future may individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on the market for the offered certificates if any including adversely affecting the value of the offered certificates particularly in illiquid markets the originators the sponsors and their affiliates will have no obligation to take refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to such companion loans or any existing or future mezzanine loans based on the potential effect on an investor in the offered certificates and may receive substantial returns from these transactions in addition the originators the sponsors or any of their respective affiliates may benefit from certain relationships including financial dealings with any borrower any nonrecourse carveout guarantor or any of their respective affiliates aside from the origination of mortgage loans or contribution of mortgage loans into this securitization conflicts may also arise because the sponsors and their respective affiliates intend to continue to actively acquire develop operate finance and dispose of real estaterelated assets in the ordinary course of their businesses during the course of their business activities the sponsors and their respective affiliates may acquire sell or lease properties or finance loans secured by properties which may include the properties securing the mortgage loans or properties that are in the same markets as the mortgaged properties such other properties similar to other thirdparty owned real estate may compete with the mortgaged properties for existing and potential tenants the sponsors may also from time to time be among the        tenants at the mortgaged properties and they should be expected to make occupancyrelated decisions based on their selfinterest and not that of the issuing entity we cannot assure you that the activities of these parties with respect to such other properties will not adversely impact the performance of the mortgaged properties   in addition certain of

“certain affiliations relationships and related transactions involving transaction parties” and “transaction parties”   these roles and other potential relationships may give rise to conflicts of interest as described in “—interests and incentives of the underwriter entities may not be aligned with your interests” ”—potential conflicts of interest in the selection of the underlying mortgage loans” and “—other potential conflicts of interest may affect your investment” below each of the foregoing relationships and related interests should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any offered certificates        interests and incentives of the underwriter entities may not be aligned with your interests   the activities and interests of the underwriters and their respective affiliates collectively the “underwriter entities” will not align with and may in fact be directly contrary to those of the certificateholders the underwriter entities are each part of separate global investment banking securities and investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations financial institutions governments and highnetworth individuals as such they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers these financial instruments include debt and equity securities currencies commodities bank loans indices baskets and other products the underwriter entities’ activities include among other things executing large block trades and taking long and short positions directly and indirectly through derivative instruments or otherwise the securities and instruments in which the underwriter entities take positions or expect to take positions include loans similar to the mortgage loans securities and instruments similar to the offered certificates and other securities and instruments market making is an activity where the underwriter entities buy and sell on behalf of customers or for their own account to satisfy the expected demand of customers by its nature market making involves facilitating transactions among market participants that have differing views of securities and instruments any short positions taken by the underwriter entities andor their clients through marketing or otherwise will increase in value if the related securities or other instruments decrease in value while positions taken by the underwriter entities andor their clients in credit derivative or other derivative transactions with other parties pursuant to which the underwriter entities andor their clients sell or buy credit protection with respect to one or more classes of the offered certificates may increase in value if the offered certificates default are expected to default or decrease in value   the underwriter entities and their clients acting through them may execute such transactions modify or terminate such

therewith without regard to whether any such action might have an adverse effect on the offered certificates or the certificateholders additionally none of the underwriter entities will have any obligation to disclose any of these securities or derivatives transactions to you in your capacity as a certificateholder as a result you should expect that the underwriter entities will take positions that are inconsistent with or adverse to the investment objectives of investors in the offered certificates   as a result of the underwriter entities’ various financial market activities including acting as a research provider investment advisor market maker or principal investor you should expect that personnel in various businesses throughout the underwriter entities will have and express research or investment views and make recommendations that are inconsistent with or adverse to the objectives of investors in the offered certificates   if an underwriter entity becomes a holder of any of the certificates through marketmaking activity or otherwise any actions that it takes in its capacity as a certificateholder including voting providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other holders of the same class or other classes of the certificates to the extent an underwriter entity makes a market in the certificates which it is under no obligation to do it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the certificates the price at which an underwriter entity may be willing to purchase certificates if it makes a market will depend on market conditions and        other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the certificates and significantly lower than the price at which it may be willing to sell certificates   in addition none of the underwriter entities will have any obligation to monitor the performance of the certificates or the actions of the parties to the pooling and servicing agreement and will have no authority to advise any party to the pooling and servicing agreement or to direct their actions   furthermore each underwriter entity expects that a completed offering will enhance its ability to assist clients and counterparties in the transaction or in related transactions including assisting clients in additional purchases

association and deutsche bank ag cayman islands branch each of the mortgage loans subject to those repurchase facilities that are to be sold by ladder capital finance llc to the depositor in connection with this securitization transaction which mortgage loans will be transferred to the depositor free and clear of any liens as a result this securitization transaction will reduce the economic exposure of wells fargo bank national association and deutsche bank securities inc to the mortgage loans that are to be transferred by ladder capital finance llc to the depositor   in

mortgage loan sellers”   the servicing of the empire mall whole loan will shift to other servicers   the servicing of the empire mall whole loan is expected to be governed by the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization only temporarily until such time as the related controlling pari passu companion loan designated as note a is securitized in a separate securitization at that time the servicing and administration of the related whole loan will shift to the master servicer and special servicer under that other securitization and will be governed exclusively by the pooling and servicing agreement entered into in connection with that securitization and the related intercreditor agreement neither the closing date of such securitization nor the identity of such other master servicer or special servicer has been determined in addition the provisions of the other pooling and servicing agreement have not yet been determined although they will be required to satisfy certain requirements set forth in the related intercreditor agreement described under “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans—the serviced pari passu whole loans—the empire mall whole loan” prospective investors should be aware that they will not have any control over the identity of either of the master servicer or the special servicer under the other pooling and servicing agreement nor will they have any assurance as to the particular terms of the other pooling and servicing agreement except to the extent of compliance with the requirements referred to in the previous sentence moreover the directing certificateholder for this securitization will not have any consent or consultation rights with respect to the servicing of the empire mall whole loan other than those limited consent and consultation rights as are provided in the related intercreditor agreement and the holder of the related controlling pari passu companion loan ie the controlling party in the related securitization of such pari passu companion loan or such other party specified in the related intercreditor agreement will likely have rights similar to or more expansive than those granted to the directing certificateholder in this transaction with respect to the other loans in this mortgage pool that are serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization transaction see “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans—the serviced pari passu whole loans—the empire mall whole loan”   potential conflicts of interest of the master servicer and the special servicer   the pooling and servicing agreement provides that the mortgage loans serviced thereunder are required to be administered in accordance with the servicing standard without regard to ownership of any certificate by the master servicer the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates see “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing standard” the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced whole loan provides that such nonserviced whole loan is required to be administered in accordance with a servicing standard that is generally similar to the servicing standard set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement see “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing of the nonserviced mortgage loans”   notwithstanding the foregoing the master servicer a subservicer the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates and as it relates to servicing and administration of a nonserviced mortgage loan each applicable master servicer subservicer special servicer or any of their respective affiliates under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced whole loan may have interests when dealing with the mortgage loans that are in conflict with those of holders of the certificates especially if the master servicer a subservicer the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates holds        certificates or securities relating to any of the applicable companion loans or has financial interests in or financial dealings with a borrower or a borrower sponsor   in order to minimize the effect of certain of these conflicts of interest as they relate to the special servicer for so long as the special servicer is a borrower party with respect to an excluded special servicer loan the special servicer will be required to resign as special servicer with respect to that mortgage loan and prior to the occurrence of a control termination event under the pooling and servicing agreement the directing certificateholder or the controlling class certificateholder on its behalf will be required to select a separate special servicer that is not a borrower party referred to herein as an “excluded special servicer” with respect to any excluded special servicer loan unless such excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan after the occurrence and during the continuance of a control termination event or at any time the applicable excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan the resigning special servicer will be required to select the related excluded special servicer see “pooling and servicing agreement—replacement of special servicer without cause” any excluded special servicer will be required to perform all of the obligations of the special servicer with respect to such excluded special servicer loan and will be entitled to all special servicing compensation with respect to such excluded special servicer loan earned during such time as the related mortgage loan is an excluded special servicer loan while the special servicer will have the same access to information related to the excluded special servicer loan as it does with respect to the other mortgage loans the special servicer will covenant in the pooling and servicing agreement that it will not directly or indirectly provide any information related to any excluded special servicer loan to the related borrower party any of the special servicer’s employees or personnel or any of its affiliates involved in the management of any investment in the related borrower party or the related mortgaged property or to its actual knowledge any nonaffiliate that holds a direct or indirect ownership interest in the related borrower party and will maintain sufficient internal controls and appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to comply with those obligations notwithstanding those restrictions there can be no assurance that the related borrower party will not obtain sensitive information related to the strategy of any contemplated workout or liquidation related to an excluded special servicer loan   each of these relationships may create a conflict of interest for instance if the special servicer or its affiliate holds a subordinate class of certificates the special servicer might seek to reduce the potential for losses allocable to those certificates from the mortgage loans by deferring acceleration in hope of maximizing future proceeds however that action could result in less proceeds to the issuing entity than would be realized if earlier action had been taken in addition no servicer is required to act in a manner more favorable to the offered certificates or any particular class of certificates than to the wfcm p nonoffered certificates any serviced companion loan holder or the holder of any serviced companion loan securities   each of the master servicer and the special servicer services and is expected to continue to

other mortgage loans may be in the same markets as and compete with certain of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans consequently personnel of the master servicer or the special servicer as applicable may perform services on behalf of the issuing entity with respect to the mortgage loans at the same time as they are performing services on behalf of other persons with respect to other mortgage loans secured by properties that compete with the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in addition the mortgage loan sellers will determine who will service mortgage loans that the mortgage loan sellers originate in the future and that        determination may be influenced by the mortgage loan seller’s opinion of servicing decisions made by the master servicer or special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement including among their things the manner in which the master servicer or special servicer enforces breaches of representations and warranties against the related mortgage loan seller this may pose inherent conflicts for the master servicer or the special servicer   the special servicer may enter into one or more arrangements with the directing certificateholder a controlling class certificateholder a serviced companion loan holder or other certificateholders or an affiliate or a third party representative of one or more of the preceding parties to provide for a discount andor revenue sharing with respect to certain of the special servicer compensation in consideration of among other things the special servicer’s appointment or continuance as special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement andor the related intercreditor agreement and limitations on the right of such person to replace the special servicer see “—other potential conflicts of interest may affect your investment” below   although the master servicer and the special servicer will be required to service and administer the mortgage loan pool in accordance with the servicing standard and accordingly without regard to their rights to receive compensation under the pooling and servicing agreement and without regard to any potential obligation to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if the master servicer or special servicer is a mortgage loan seller the possibility of receiving additional servicing compensation in the nature of assumption and modification fees the continuation of receiving fees to service or specially service a mortgage loan or the desire to avoid a repurchase demand resulting from a breach of a representation and warranty or material document default may under certain circumstances provide the master servicer or the special servicer as the case may be with an economic disincentive to comply

certificateholder or a serviced companion loan holder or its representative may take actions with respect to the related serviced whole loan that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates to the extent described under “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans” in connection with        the serviced whole loan the serviced companion loan holder does not have any duties to the holders of any class of certificates and it may have interests in conflict with those of the certificateholders as a result it is possible that the serviced companion loan holder may advise the special servicer to take actions with respect to the related serviced whole loan that conflict with the interests of holders of certain classes of the certificates   potential conflicts of interest in the selection of the underlying mortgage loans   the anticipated initial investor in the class e class f and class g certificates which is referred to in this prospectus as the “bpiece buyer” see “pooling and servicing agreement—the directing certificateholder—general” was given the opportunity by the sponsors to perform due diligence on the mortgage loans originally identified by the sponsors for inclusion in the issuing entity and to request the removal resizing or change in the expected repayment dates or other features of some or all of the mortgage loans the mortgage pool as originally proposed by the sponsors was adjusted based on certain of these requests in addition the bpiece buyer received or may have received price adjustments or cost mitigation arrangements in connection with accepting certain mortgage loans in the mortgage pool   we cannot assure you that you or another investor would have made the same requests to modify the original pool as the bpiece buyer or that the final pool as influenced by the bpiece buyer’s feedback will not adversely affect the performance of your certificates and benefit the performance of the bpiece buyer’s certificates because of the differing subordination levels the bpiece buyer has interests that may in some circumstances differ from those of purchasers of other classes of certificates and may desire a portfolio composition that benefits the bpiece buyer but that does not benefit other investors in addition the bpiece buyer may enter into hedging or other transactions or otherwise have business objectives that also could cause its interests with respect to the mortgage pool to diverge from those of other purchasers of the certificates the bpiece buyer performed due diligence solely for its own benefit and has no liability to any person or entity for conducting its due diligence the bpiece buyer is not required to take into account the interests of any other investor in the certificates in exercising remedies or voting or other rights in its capacity as owner of its certificates or in making requests or recommendations to the sponsors as to the selection of the mortgage loans and the establishment of other transaction terms investors are not entitled to rely on in any way the bpiece buyer’s acceptance of a mortgage loan the bpiece buyer’s acceptance of a mortgage loan does not constitute and may not be construed as an endorsement of such mortgage loan the underwriting for such mortgage loan or the originator of such mortgage loan   the bpiece buyer will have no liability to any certificateholder for any actions taken by it as described in the preceding two paragraphs and the pooling and servicing agreement will provide that each certificateholder by its acceptance of a certificate waives any claims against such buyers in respect of such actions   the bpiece buyer or an affiliate will constitute the initial directing certificateholder the directing certificateholder will have certain rights to direct and consult with the special servicer in addition the directing certificateholder will generally have certain consultation rights with regard to a nonserviced mortgage loan under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of such nonserviced whole loan and the related intercreditor agreement see “pooling and servicing agreement—the directing certificateholder” and “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans—the nonserviced whole loans—consultation and control”        because the incentives and actions of the bpiece buyers may in some circumstances differ from or be adverse to those of purchasers of the offered certificates you are advised and encouraged to make your own investment decision based on a careful review of the information set forth in this prospectus and your own view of the mortgage pool   conflicts of interest may occur as a result of the rights of the applicable directing certificateholder to terminate the special servicer of the applicable whole loan   with respect to each whole loan the directing certificateholder exercising control rights over that whole loan will be entitled under certain circumstances to remove the special servicer under the applicable pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of such whole loan and in such circumstances appoint a successor special servicer for such whole loan or have certain consent rights with respect to such removal or replacement the party with this appointment power may have special relationships or interests that conflict with those of the holders of one or more classes of certificates in addition that party does not have any duties to the holders of any class of certificates may act solely in its own interests and will have no liability to any certificateholders for having done so no certificateholder may take any action against the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization or under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced whole loan or against any other parties for having acted solely in their respective interests see “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans” for a description of these rights to terminate the special servicer   other potential conflicts of interest may affect your investment   the managers of the mortgaged properties and the borrowers may experience conflicts in the management andor ownership of the mortgaged properties because   ·a substantial number of the mortgaged properties are managed by property managers affiliated with the respective borrowers   ·these property managers also may manage andor franchise additional properties including properties that may compete with the mortgaged properties and   ·affiliates of the managers andor the borrowers or the managers andor the borrowers themselves also may own other properties including competing properties   none of the borrowers property managers or any of their affiliates or any employees of the foregoing has any duty to favor the leasing of space in the mortgaged properties over the leasing of space in other properties one or more of which may be adjacent to or near the mortgaged properties   each of the foregoing relationships should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any certificates   other risks relating to the certificates   the certificates are limited obligations   the certificates when issued will only represent ownership interests in the issuing entity the certificates will not represent an interest in or obligation of and will not be guaranteed by the sponsors the depositor or any other person the primary assets of the        issuing entity will be the mortgage loans and distributions on any class of certificates will depend solely on the amount and timing of payments and other collections in respect of the mortgage loans we cannot assure you that the cash flow from the mortgaged properties and the proceeds of any sale or refinancing of the mortgaged properties will be sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the mortgage loans or to distribute in full the amounts of interest and principal to which the certificateholders will be entitled see “description of the certificates—general”   the certificates may have limited liquidity and the market value of the certificates may decline   your certificates will not be listed on any national securities exchange or traded on any automated quotation systems of any registered securities association and there is currently no secondary market for your certificates the underwriters have no obligation to make a market in the offered certificates we cannot assure you that an active secondary market for the certificates will develop additionally one or more investors may purchase substantial portions of one or more classes of certificates accordingly you may not have an active or liquid secondary market for your certificates   the market value of the certificates will also be influenced by the supply of and demand for cmbs generally a number of factors will affect investors’ demand for cmbs including   ·the availability of alternative investments that offer higher yields or are perceived as being a better credit risk than cmbs or as having a less

an ongoing basis a material net economic interest which in any event may not be less than  and b a requirement the “due diligence requirement” that the investing credit institution or investment firm has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of the securitization and the underlying exposures and has established procedures for monitoring them on an ongoing basis   national regulators in eea member states impose penal risk weights on securitization investments in respect of which the retention requirement or the due diligence requirement has not been satisfied in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the investing credit institution or investment firm   if the retention requirement or the due diligence requirement is not satisfied in respect of a securitization investment held by a noneea subsidiary of an eea credit institution or investment firm then an additional risk weight may be applied to such securitization investment when taken into account on a consolidated basis at the level of the eea credit institution or investment firm   requirements similar to the retention requirement and the due diligence requirement the “similar requirements” i apply to investments in securitizations by investment funds managed by eea investment managers subject to eu directive eu and ii subject to the adoption of certain secondary legislation will apply to investments in securitizations by eea insurance and reinsurance undertakings and by eea undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities on september   the european commission published a proposal for a new regulation which if adopted would recast the retention requirement the due diligence requirement and similar requirements and which would additionally apply such requirements to investments in securitizations by eu occupational pension schemes   none of the sponsors the depositor or the issuing entity intends to retain a material net economic interest in the securitization constituted by the issue of the offered certificates in accordance with the retention requirement or to take any other action which may be required by eearegulated investors for the purposes of their compliance with the retention requirement the due diligence requirement or similar requirements consequently the offered certificates are not a

by the banking regulators in july  and began phasing in on january   these regulations implement the increased capital requirements established under the basel accord these new capital regulations

ownership of assetbacked securities such as cmbs as a result of these regulations investments in commercial mortgagebacked securities like the certificates by institutions subject to the risk based capital regulations may result in greater capital charges to these financial institutions and these new regulations may otherwise adversely affect the treatment of commercial mortgagebacked securities

statistical rating organizations may assign different ratings to the certificates ratings of the certificates reflect only the views of the applicable rating agencies as of the dates such ratings were issued ratings may affect erisa eligibility ratings may be downgraded   ratings assigned to the offered certificates by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations engaged by the depositor   ·are based on among other things the economic characteristics of the mortgaged properties and other relevant structural features of the transaction   ·do not represent any assessment of the yield to maturity that a certificateholder may experience   ·reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies as of the date such ratings were issued   ·may be reviewed revised suspended downgraded qualified or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency as a result of changes in or unavailability of information   ·may have been determined based on criteria that included an analysis of historical mortgage loan data that may not reflect future experience   ·may reflect assumptions by such rating agencies regarding performance of the mortgage loans that are not accurate as evidenced by the significant amount of downgrades qualifications and withdrawals of ratings assigned to previously issued cmbs by the hired rating agencies and other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations during the recent credit crisis and   ·do not consider to what extent the offered certificates will be subject to prepayment or that the outstanding principal amount of any class of offered certificates will be prepaid   the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that assign ratings to any class of offered certificates will establish the amount of credit support if any for such class of offered certificates based on among other things an assumed level of defaults delinquencies and losses with respect to the mortgage loans actual losses may however exceed the assumed levels if actual losses on the mortgage loans exceed the assumed levels you may be required to bear the additional losses   in addition the rating of any class of offered certificates below an investment grade rating by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization whether upon initial issuance of such class of certificates or as a result of a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the ability of an employee benefit plan or other investor to purchase or retain those offered certificates see “certain erisa considerations” and “legal investment”        nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that were not engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates relying on information they receive pursuant to rule g under the securities exchange act of  as amended or otherwise if any such unsolicited ratings are issued we cannot assure you that they will not be different from any ratings assigned by a rating agency engaged by the depositor the issuance of unsolicited ratings by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization on a class of the offered certificates that are lower than ratings assigned by a rating agency engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of that class   as part of the process of obtaining ratings for the offered certificates the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to  nationally recognized statistical rating organizations based on preliminary feedback from those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations at that time the depositor selected  of those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to rate certain classes of the certificates and not the other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations due in part to their initial subordination levels for the various classes of the certificates if the depositor had selected the other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to rate the certificates we cannot assure you that the ratings such other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations would have assigned to the certificates would not have been lower than the ratings assigned by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations engaged by the depositor further in the case of one nationally recognized statistical rating organization the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates due in part to the final subordination levels provided by that nationally recognized statistical rating organization for the classes of certificates if the depositor had selected that nationally recognized statistical rating organization to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated by it its ratings of those other certificates may have been different and potentially lower than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by the other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations hired by the depositor in addition the decision not to engage one or more other rating agencies in the rating of certain classes of certificates to be issued in connection with this transaction may negatively impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of those classes of certificates although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization a nationally recognized statistical rating organization might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor neither the depositor nor any other person or entity will have any duty to notify you if any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues or delivers notice of its intention to issue consolidated ratings on one or more classes of certificates after the date of this prospectus   furthermore the securities and exchange commission may determine that any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates no longer qualifies as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or is no longer qualified to rate the certificates or may no longer rate similar securities for a limited period as a result of an enforcement action and that determination may also have an adverse effect on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates to the extent that the provisions of any mortgage loan or the pooling and servicing agreement condition any action event or circumstance on the delivery of a rating agency confirmation the pooling and servicing agreement will require delivery or deemed delivery of a rating agency confirmation only from the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates or in the case of a serviced whole loan any related companion loan securities        we are not obligated to maintain any particular rating with respect to the certificates and the ratings initially assigned to the certificates by any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates could change adversely as a result of changes affecting among other things the mortgage loans the mortgaged properties the parties to the pooling and servicing agreement or as a result of changes to ratings criteria employed by any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates although these changes would not necessarily be or result from an event of default on any mortgage loan any adverse change to the ratings of the offered certificates would likely have an adverse effect on the market value liquidity andor regulatory characteristics of those certificates   further certain actions provided for in loan agreements may require a rating agency confirmation be obtained from the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates and in the case of a serviced whole loan any companion loan securities as a precondition to taking such action in certain circumstances this condition may be deemed to have been met or waived without such a rating agency confirmation being obtained in the event such an action is taken without a rating agency confirmation being obtained we cannot assure you that the applicable rating agency will not downgrade qualify or withdraw its ratings as a result of the taking of such action see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans—‘dueonsale’ and ‘dueonencumbrance’ provisions” “pooling and servicing agreement—rating agency confirmations” and “ratings” for additional considerations regarding the ratings including a description of the process of obtaining confirmations of ratings for the offered certificates   your yield may be affected by defaults prepayments and other factors   general the yield to maturity on each class of offered certificates will depend in part on the following   ·the purchase price for the certificates   ·the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans both voluntary and involuntary and the allocation of principal prepayments to the respective classes of offered certificates with certificate balances and   ·the allocation of shortfalls and losses on the mortgage loans to the respective classes of offered certificates   for this purpose principal payments include voluntary and involuntary prepayments such as prepayments resulting from the application of loan reserves property releases casualty or condemnation defaults and liquidations as well as principal payments resulting from repurchases due to material breaches of representations and warranties or material document defects or purchases by a companion loan holder or mezzanine lender if any pursuant to a purchase option or sales of defaulted mortgage loans   any changes in the weighted average lives of your certificates may adversely affect your yield in general if you buy a certificate at a premium and principal distributions occur faster than expected your actual yield to maturity will be lower than expected if principal distributions are very high holders of certificates purchased at a premium might not fully recover their initial investment conversely if you buy a certificate at a discount and principal distributions occur more slowly than expected your actual yield to maturity will be lower than expected        prepayments resulting in a shortening of weighted average lives of your certificates may be made at a time of low interest rates when you may be unable to reinvest the resulting payment of principal on your certificates at a rate comparable to the effective yield anticipated by you in making your investment in the certificates while delays and extensions resulting in a lengthening of those weighted average lives may occur at a time of high interest rates when you may have been able to reinvest principal payments that would otherwise have been received by you at higher rates   in addition the extent to which prepayments on the mortgage loans in the issuing entity ultimately affect the weighted average life of the certificates will depend on the terms of the certificates more particularly   ·a class of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately larger share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans increases the “call risk” or the likelihood of early retirement of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively fast and   ·a class of certificates that entitles the holders of the certificates to a disproportionately smaller share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans increases the likelihood of “extension risk” or an extended average life of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively slow   the timing of prepayments and repurchases may change your anticipated yield   the rate at which voluntary prepayments occur on the mortgage loans will be affected by a variety of factors including   ·the terms of the mortgage loans including the length of any prepayment lockout period and the applicable yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums and the extent to which the related mortgage loan terms may be practically enforced   ·the level of prevailing interest rates   ·the availability of credit for commercial real estate   ·the master servicer’s or special servicer’s ability to enforce yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums   ·the failure to meet certain requirements for the release of escrows   ·the occurrence of casualties or natural disasters and   ·economic demographic tax legal or other factors   although a yield maintenance charge or other prepayment premium provision of a mortgage loan is intended to create an economic disincentive for a borrower to prepay voluntarily a mortgage loan we cannot assure you that mortgage loans that have such provisions will not prepay   the extent to which the special servicer if any forecloses upon takes title to and disposes of any mortgaged property related to a mortgage loan or sells defaulted mortgage loans will affect the weighted average lives of your certificates if the special servicer if any forecloses upon a significant number of the related mortgage loans and depending        upon the amount and timing of recoveries from the related mortgaged properties or sells defaulted mortgage loans your certificates may have a shorter weighted average life   delays in liquidations of defaulted mortgage loans and modifications extending the maturity of mortgage loans will tend to delay the payment of principal on the mortgage loans the ability of the related borrower to make any required balloon payment typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the related mortgaged property a significant number of the mortgage loans require balloon payments at maturity or anticipated repayment date and there is a risk that a number of those mortgage loans may default at maturity or anticipated repayment date or that the special servicer if any may extend the maturity of a number of those mortgage loans in connection with workouts we cannot assure you as to the borrowers’ abilities to make mortgage loan payments on a full and timely basis including any balloon payments at maturity or anticipated repayment date bankruptcy of the borrower or adverse conditions in the market where the mortgaged property is located may among other things delay the recovery of proceeds in the case of defaults losses on the mortgage loans due to uninsured risks or insufficient hazard insurance proceeds may create shortfalls in distributions to certificateholders any required indemnification of a party to the pooling and servicing agreement in connection with legal actions relating to the issuing entity the related agreements or the certificates may also result in shortfalls   see “—risks relating to the mortgage loans—risks relating to enforceability of yield maintenance charges prepayment premiums or defeasance provisions” above and “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans—prepayment protections and certain involuntary prepayments”   in addition if a sponsor repurchases a mortgage loan from the issuing entity due to a material breach of one or more of its representations or warranties or a material document defect the repurchase price paid will be passed through to the holders of the certificates with the same effect as if the mortgage loan had been prepaid in part or in full and no yield maintenance charge or other prepayment premium would be payable additionally any mezzanine lender if any may have the option to purchase the related mortgage loan after certain defaults and the purchase price may not include any yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums as a result of such a repurchase or purchase investors in the class xa and class xb certificates and any other certificates purchased at a premium might not fully recoup their initial investment a repurchase a prepayment or the exercise of a purchase option may adversely affect the yield to maturity on your certificates in this respect see “description of the mortgage loan purchase agreements” and “pooling and servicing agreement—realization upon mortgage loans”   the certificates with notional amounts will not be entitled to distributions of principal but instead will accrue interest on their respective notional amounts because the notional amount of the certificates indicated in the table below is based upon the outstanding certificate balances of the related class of certificates the yield to maturity on the indicated certificates will be extremely sensitive to the rate and timing of prepayments of principal liquidations and principal losses on the mortgage loans to the extent allocated to the related certificates        interestonly class of certificates    underlying class  class xa   class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb and class as certificates class xb   class b certificates   a rapid rate of principal prepayments liquidations andor principal losses on the mortgage loans could result in the failure to recoup the initial investment in the class xa andor class xb certificates investors in the class xa or class xb certificates should fully consider the associated risks including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of amortization prepayment or other liquidation of the mortgage loans could result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial investments the yield to maturity of the certificates with notional amounts may be adversely affected by the prepayment of mortgage loans with higher net mortgage loan rates see “yield and maturity considerations—yield on the certificates with notional amounts”   in addition with respect to the class asb certificates the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and the sensitivity of the class asb certificates to principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period of time during which the class a class aa class ab class a and class a certificates remain outstanding as such the class asb certificates will become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were when the class a class aa class ab class a and class a certificates were outstanding   your yield may be adversely affected by prepayments resulting from earnout reserves   with respect to certain mortgage loans earnout escrows may have been established at origination which funds may be released to the related borrower upon satisfaction of certain conditions if such conditions with respect to any such mortgage loan are not satisfied the amounts reserved in such escrows may be or may be required to be applied to the payment of the mortgage loan which would have the same effect on the offered certificates as a prepayment of the mortgage loan except that such application of funds would not be accompanied by any prepayment premium or yield maintenance charge see annex a the pooling and servicing agreement will provide that unless required by the mortgage loan documents the master servicer will not apply such amounts as a prepayment if no event of default has occurred   losses and shortfalls may change your anticipated yield   if losses on the mortgage loans exceed the aggregate certificate balance of the classes of certificates subordinated to a particular class that class will suffer a loss equal to the full amount of the excess up to the outstanding certificate balance of that class even if losses on the mortgage loans are not borne by your certificates those losses may affect the weighted average life and yield to maturity of your certificates   for example certain shortfalls in interest as a result of involuntary prepayments may reduce the funds available to make payments on your certificates in addition if the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee reimburses itself or a master servicer special servicer trustee or other party to a pooling and servicing agreement governing the        servicing of a nonserviced whole loan out of general collections on the mortgage loans included in the issuing entity for any advance that it or any such other party has determined is not recoverable out of collections on the related mortgage loan then to the extent that this reimbursement is made from collections of principal on the mortgage loans in the issuing entity that reimbursement will reduce the amount of principal available to be distributed on the certificates and will result in a reduction of the certificate balance or notional amount of a class of certificates see “description of the certificates—distributions” likewise if the master servicer or the trustee reimburses itself out of principal collections on the mortgage loans for any workoutdelayed reimbursement amounts that reimbursement will reduce the amount of principal available to be distributed on the certificates on that distribution date this reimbursement would have the effect of reducing current payments of principal on the offered certificates other than the certificates and the class r certificates with notional amounts and extending the weighted average lives of the offered certificates with certificate balances see “description of the certificates—distributions”   in addition to the extent losses are realized on the mortgage loans first the class g certificates then the class f certificates then the class e certificates then the class d certificates then the class c certificates then the class b certificates then the class as certificates and then pro rata the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates based on their respective certificate balances will bear such losses up to an amount equal to the respective outstanding certificate balance of that class a reduction in the certificate balance of the class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb class as or class b certificates will result in a corresponding reduction in the notional amount of the class xa and class xb certificates we make no representation as to the anticipated rate or timing of prepayments voluntary or involuntary or rate timing or amount of liquidations or losses on the mortgage loans or as to the anticipated yield to maturity of any such offered certificate see “yield and maturity considerations”   risk of early termination   the issuing entity is subject to optional termination under certain circumstances see “pooling and servicing agreement—termination retirement of certificates” in the event of this termination you might receive some principal payments earlier than otherwise expected which could adversely affect your anticipated yield to maturity   subordination of the subordinated certificates will affect the timing of distributions and the application of losses on the subordinated certificates   as described in this prospectus the rights of the holders of class as class b and class c certificates to receive payments of principal and interest otherwise payable on the certificates they hold will be subordinated to such rights of the holders of the more senior certificates having an earlier alphabetical or alphanumeric class designation if you acquire any class as class b or class c certificates then your rights to receive distributions of amounts collected or advanced on or in respect of the mortgage loans will generally be subordinated to those of the holders of the class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb class xa class xb and class xd certificates and if your certificates are class b or class c certificates to those of the holders of the class as certificates and if your certificates are class c certificates to those of the holders of the class b certificates see “description of the certificates” as a result investors in those classes of certificates that are subordinated in whole or part to other classes of certificates will generally bear the effects of losses on the mortgage loans and unreimbursed expenses of the issuing entity before the holders of those other classes of certificates see        “description of the certificates—distributions” and “—subordination allocation of realized losses”   your lack of control over the issuing entity and the mortgage loans can impact your investment   you have limited voting rights   except as described in this prospectus you and other certificateholders generally do not have a right to vote and do not have the right to make decisions with respect to the administration of the issuing entity and the mortgage loans with respect to mortgage loans other than mortgage loan that will be serviced under a separate pooling and servicing agreement those decisions are generally made subject to the express terms of the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction by the master servicer the special servicer the trustee or the certificate administrator as applicable subject to any rights of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction and the rights of the holders of the related companion loans and mezzanine debt under the related intercreditor agreement with respect to a nonserviced mortgage loan you will generally not have any right to vote or make decisions with respect a nonserviced mortgage loan and those decisions will generally be made by the master servicer or the special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan and the related companion loan subject to the rights of the directing certificateholder appointed under such pooling and servicing agreement see “pooling and servicing agreement” and “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans” in particular with respect to the risks relating to a modification of a mortgage loan see “—risks relating to modifications of the mortgage loans” below   in certain limited circumstances where certificateholders have the right to vote on matters affecting the issuing entity in some cases these votes are by certificateholders taken as a whole and in others the vote is by class your interests as an owner of certificates of a particular class may not be aligned with the interests of owners of one or more other classes of certificates in connection with any such vote in addition in all cases voting is based on the outstanding certificate balance which is reduced by realized losses in certain cases with respect to the termination of the special servicer and the operating advisor certain voting rights will also be reduced by appraisal reductions as described below these limitations on voting could adversely affect your ability to protect your interests with respect to matters voted on by certificateholders see “description of the certificates—voting rights” you will have no rights to vote on any servicing matters related to the mortgage loan that will be serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced whole loan   the rights of the directing certificateholder and the operating advisor could adversely affect your investment   the directing certificateholder will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to certain matters relating to the mortgage loans other than any nonserviced mortgage loan and other than any excluded loan and the right to replace the special servicer with or without cause except that if a control termination event ie an event in which the certificate balance of the most senior class of certificates that is eligible to be a controlling class as reduced by the application of appraisal reductions and realized losses is less than  of its initial certificate balance occurs and is continuing other than with respect to the empire mall mortgage loan with respect to which the directing certificateholder prior to the securitization of the controlling pari passu companion loan will have the rights and powers of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing        agreement the directing certificateholder will lose the consent rights and the right to replace the special servicer and if a consultation termination event ie an event in which the certificate balance of the most senior class of certificates that is eligible to be a controlling class as reduced by the application of realized losses is less than  of its initial certificate balance occurs then the directing certificateholder will lose the consultation rights see “pooling and servicing agreement—the directing certificateholder”   these actions and decisions with respect to which the directing certificateholder has consent or consultation rights include among others certain modifications to the mortgage loans or serviced whole loans including modifications of monetary terms foreclosure or comparable conversion of the related mortgaged properties and certain sales of mortgage loans or reo properties for less than the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest fees and expenses as a result of the exercise of these rights by the directing certificateholder the special servicer may take actions with respect to a mortgage loan that could adversely affect the interests of investors in one or more classes of offered certificates   similarly with respect to a nonserviced mortgage loan the special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan may at the direction or upon the advice of the directing certificateholder or equivalent of the related securitization trust holding the controlling note for a nonserviced whole loan take actions with respect to such nonserviced mortgage loan and related companion loan that could adversely affect a nonserviced mortgage loan and therefore the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates the issuing entity as the holder of the noncontrolling note will have limited consultation rights with respect to major decisions relating to a nonserviced whole loan and in connection with a sale of a defaulted loan and such rights will be exercised by the directing certificateholder for this transaction so long as no control termination event has occurred and is continuing and by the special servicer if a control termination event has occurred and is continuing additionally with respect to each nonserviced whole loan in circumstances similar to those described above the directing certificateholder or the equivalent of the related securitization trust will have the right to replace the special servicer of such securitization with or without cause and without the consent of the issuing entity see “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans” and “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing of the nonserviced mortgage loans”   although the special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement and the special servicer for a nonserviced mortgage loan are not permitted to take actions which are prohibited by law or violate the servicing standard under the applicable pooling and servicing agreement or the terms of the related loan documents it is possible that the directing certificateholder or equivalent entity under such pooling and servicing agreement may direct or advise as applicable the related special servicer to take actions with respect to such mortgage loan that conflict with the interests of the holders of certain classes of the certificates   you will be acknowledging and agreeing by your purchase of offered certificates that the directing certificateholder and the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan   i       may have special relationships and interests that conflict with those of holders of one or more classes of certificates   ii      may act solely in the interests of the holders of the controlling class or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan the controlling class of the securitization        trust formed under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan   iii     does not have any duties to the holders of any class of certificates other than the controlling class or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan the controlling class of the securitization trust formed under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan

the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan over the interests of the holders of one or more other classes of certificates and   v      will have no liability whatsoever other than to a controlling class certificateholder for having so acted as set forth in clauses i – iv above and that no certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against the directing certificateholder or the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a nonserviced mortgage loan or any of their respective affiliates directors officers employees shareholders members partners agents or principals for having so acted   in addition if a control termination event has occurred and is continuing the operating advisor will have certain consultation rights with respect to certain matters relating to the mortgage loans other than any nonserviced mortgage loan further if a consultation termination event has occurred and is continuing the operating advisor will have the right to recommend a replacement of a special servicer as described under “pooling and servicing agreement—the operating advisor” the operating advisor is generally required to act on behalf of the issuing entity and in the best interest of and for the benefit of the certificateholders and with respect to any serviced whole loan for the benefit of the holders of the related companion loan as a collective whole as if the certificateholders and companion loan holders constituted a single lender we cannot assure you that any actions taken by the special servicer as a result of a recommendation or consultation by the operating advisor will not adversely affect the interests of investors in one or more classes of certificates with respect to each nonserviced mortgage loan the operating advisor appointed under the related pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of such nonserviced mortgage loan will have similar rights and duties under such pooling and servicing agreement further the operating advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction with respect to any nonserviced mortgage loan the empire mall mortgage loan or any related reo property additionally with respect to the empire mall mortgage loan in the event the related controlling pari passu companion loan is not included in a future securitization the pooling and servicing agreement under this securitization does not provide for an operating advisor with rights and duties in connection with the servicing and administration of such serviced whole loan see “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing of the nonserviced mortgage loans”   you have limited rights to replace the servicer the special servicer the trustee the certificate administrator the operating advisor or the asset representations reviewer   in general the directing certificateholder will have the right to terminate and replace the special servicer with or without cause so long as no control termination event has occurred and is continuing and other than in respect of any excluded loan as described in this        prospectus after the occurrence and during continuance of a control termination event under the pooling and servicing agreement the special servicer may also be removed in certain circumstances x if a request is made by certificateholders evidencing not less than  of the voting rights taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the respective certificate balances and y upon receipt of approval by certificateholders holding at least  of a quorum of the certificateholders which is the holders of certificates evidencing at least  of the voting rights taking into account the application of realized losses and the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the respective certificate balances see “pooling and servicing agreement—replacement of special servicer without cause”   the certificateholders will generally have no right to replace and terminate the master servicer the trustee and the certificate administrator without cause the vote of the requisite percentage of certificateholders may terminate the operating advisor or the asset representations reviewer without cause the vote of the requisite percentage of the certificateholders will be required to replace the master servicer the special servicer the operating advisor and the asset representations reviewer even for cause and certain termination events may be waived by the vote of the requisite percentage of the certificateholders with respect to each nonserviced whole loan in circumstances similar to those described above the directing certificateholder or the equivalent and the certificateholders of the securitization trust related to such other pooling and servicing agreement will have the right to replace the special servicer of such securitization with or without cause and without the consent of the issuing entity the certificateholders will have no right to replace the master servicer or the special servicer of the pooling and servicing agreement relating to a nonserviced mortgage loan we cannot assure that your lack of control over the replacement of these parties will not have an adverse impact on your investment   the rights of companion holders and mezzanine debt may adversely affect your investment   the holders of a serviced pari passu companion loan relating to a serviced pari passu mortgage loan other than the holder of the empire mall controlling pari passu companion loan will have certain consultation rights on a nonbinding basis with respect to major decisions relating to the related whole loan under the related intercreditor agreement such companion loan holder and its representative may have interests in conflict with those of the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates and may advise the special servicer to take actions that conflict with the interests of the holders of certain classes of the certificates although any such consultation is nonbinding and the special servicer may not be required to consult with the companion loan holder unless required to do so under the servicing standard we cannot assure you that the exercise of the rights of such companion loan holder will not delay any action to be taken by the special servicer and will not adversely affect your investment   the holder of the controlling empire mall pari passu companion loans will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to certain matters relating to the empire mall mortgage loan and the right to replace the special servicer with or without cause solely with respect to the empire mall whole loan these actions and decisions include among others the right in certain circumstances to modify or waive any of the terms of the empire mall mortgage loan documents call or waive any event of default under the empire mall mortgage loan documents and consent to any action or failure to act by any party to the empire mall mortgage loan documents the exercise of these rights may cause the special servicer to take actions with respect to the empire mall whole loan that could adversely affect the interests of investors in one or more classes of offered certificates        with respect to mortgage loans that have mezzanine debt the related mezzanine lender will have the right under certain limited circumstances to i cure certain defaults with respect to and under certain default scenarios purchase without payment of any yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium the related mortgage loan and ii so long as no event of default with respect to the related mortgage loan continues after the mezzanine lender’s cure right has expired approve certain modifications and consent to certain actions to be taken with respect to the related mortgage loan see “description of the mortgage pool—mortgage pool characteristics” and “—additional indebtedness”   the purchase option that the holder of mezzanine debt holds pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement generally permits such holder to purchase its related defaulted mortgage loan for a purchase price generally equal to the outstanding principal balance of the related defaulted mortgage loan together with accrued and unpaid interest exclusive of default interest on and unpaid servicing expenses protective advances and interest on advances related to such defaulted mortgage loan however in the event such holder is not obligated to pay some or all of those fees and additional expenses including any liquidation fee payable to the special servicer under the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement then the exercise of such holder’s rights under the intercreditor agreement to purchase the related mortgage loan from the issuing entity may result in a loss to the issuing entity in the amount of those fees and additional expenses in addition such holder’s right to cure defaults under the related defaulted mortgage loan could delay the issuing entity’s ability to realize on or otherwise take action with respect to such defaulted mortgage loan   in addition with respect to a nonserviced mortgage loan you will generally not have any right to vote or consent with respect to any matters relating to the servicing and administration of a nonserviced mortgage loan however the directing certificateholder or equivalent of the related securitization trust holding the controlling note for the related nonserviced whole loan will have the right to vote or consent with respect to certain specified matters relating to the servicing and administration of such nonserviced mortgage loan the interests of the securitization trust holding the controlling note may conflict with those of the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates and accordingly the directing certificateholder or the equivalent of such securitization trust may direct or advise the special servicer for the related securitization trust to take actions that conflict with the interests of the holders of certain classes of the certificates see “description of the mortgage pool—the whole loans—the nonserviced pari passu whole loans” and “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing of the nonservicing mortgage loan”   you will be acknowledging and agreeing by your purchase of offered certificates that the companion loan holders   ·may have special relationships and interests that conflict with those of holders of one or more classes of certificates   ·may act solely in its own interests without regard to your interests   ·do not have any duties to any other person including the holders of any class of certificates   ·may take actions that favor its interests over the interests of the holders of one or more classes of certificates and   ·will have no liability whatsoever for having so acted and that no certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against the companion loan holder or its        representative or any director officer employee agent or principal of the companion loan holder or its representative for having so acted   risks relating to modifications of the mortgage loans   as delinquencies or defaults occur the special servicer will be required to utilize an increasing amount of resources to work with borrowers to maximize collections on the mortgage loans serviced by it this may include modifying the terms of such mortgage loans that are in default or whose default is reasonably foreseeable at each step in the process of trying to bring a defaulted mortgage loan current or in maximizing proceeds to the issuing entity the special servicer will be required to invest time and resources not otherwise required when collecting payments on performing mortgage loans modifications of mortgage loans implemented by the special servicer in order to maximize ultimate proceeds of such mortgage loans to the issuing entity may have the effect of among other things reducing or otherwise changing the mortgage rate forgiving or forbearing payments of principal interest or other amounts owed under the mortgage loan extending the final maturity date of the mortgage loan capitalizing or deferring delinquent interest and other amounts owed under the mortgage loan forbearing payment of a portion of the principal balance of the mortgage loan or any combination of these or other modifications   any modified mortgage loan may remain in the issuing entity and the modification may result in a reduction in or may eliminate the funds received in respect of such mortgage loan in particular any modification to reduce or forgive the amount of interest payable on the mortgage loan will reduce the amount cash flow available to make distributions of interest on the certificates which will likely impact the most subordinated classes of certificates that suffer the shortfall to the extent the modification defers principal payments on the mortgage loan including as a result of an extension of its stated maturity date certificates entitled to principal distributions will likely be repaid more slowly than anticipated and if principal payments on the mortgage loan are forgiven the reduction will cause a writedown of the certificate balances of the certificates in reverse order of seniority see “description of the certificates—subordination allocation of realized losses”   the ability to modify mortgage loans by the special servicer may be limited by several factors first if the special servicer has to consider a large number of modifications operational constraints may affect the ability of the special servicer to adequately address all of the needs of the borrowers furthermore the terms of the related servicing agreement may prohibit the special servicer from taking certain actions in connection with a loan modification such as an extension of the loan term beyond a specified date such as a specified number of years prior to the rated final distribution date you should consider the importance of the role of the special servicer in maximizing collections for the transaction and the impediments the special servicer may encounter when servicing delinquent or defaulted mortgage loans in some cases failure by a special servicer to timely modify the terms of a defaulted mortgage loan may reduce amounts available for distribution on the certificates in respect of such mortgage loan and consequently may reduce amounts available for distribution to the related certificates in addition even if a loan modification is successfully completed we cannot assure you that the related borrower will continue to perform under the terms of the modified mortgage loan   modifications that are designed to maximize collections in the aggregate may adversely affect a particular class of certificates the pooling and servicing agreement obligates the special servicer not to consider the interests of individual classes of certificates you should note that in connection with considering a modification or other type of loss mitigation the special servicer may incur or bear related outofpocket expenses such as appraisal fees which would be reimbursed to the special servicer from the transaction as servicing        advances and paid from amounts received on the modified loan or from other mortgage loans in the mortgage pool but in each case prior to distributions being made on the certificates   sponsors may not make required repurchases or substitutions of defective mortgage loans or pay any loss of value payment sufficient to cover all losses on a defective mortgage loan   each sponsor is the sole warranting party in respect of the mortgage loans sold by such sponsor to us neither we nor any of our affiliates except wells fargo bank national association in its capacity as a sponsor is obligated to repurchase or substitute any mortgage loan or make any payment to compensate the issuing entity in connection with a breach of any representation or warranty of a sponsor or any document defect if the sponsor defaults on its obligation to do so we cannot assure you that the sponsors will effect such repurchases or substitutions or make such payment to compensate the issuing entity although a loss of value payment may only be made to the extent that the special servicer deems such amount to be sufficient to compensate the issuing entity for such material defect or material breach we cannot assure you that such loss of value payment will fully compensate the issuing entity for such material defect or material breach in all respects in addition the sponsors may have various legal defenses available to them in connection with a repurchase or substitution obligation or an obligation to pay the loss of value payment in particular in the case of a nonserviced whole loan that is serviced under the related nonserviced pooling and servicing agreement entered into in connection with the securitization of the related pari passu companion loan the asset representations reviewer under that pooling and servicing agreement if any may review the diligence file relating to such pari passu companion loan concurrently with the review of the asset representations reviewer of the related mortgage loan for this transaction and their findings may be inconsistent and such inconsistency may allow the related mortgage loan seller to challenge the findings of the asset representations reviewer of the affected mortgage loan any mortgage loan that is not repurchased or substituted and that is not a “qualified mortgage” for a remic may cause designated portions of the issuing entity to fail to qualify as a remic or cause the issuing entity to incur a tax see “description of the mortgage loan purchase agreements”   risks relating to interest on advances and special servicing compensation   to the extent described in this prospectus the master servicer the special servicer and the trustee will each be entitled to receive interest on unreimbursed advances made by it at the “prime rate” as published in the wall street journal this interest will generally accrue from the date on which the related advance is made or the related expense is incurred to the date of reimbursement in addition under certain circumstances including delinquencies in the payment of principal andor interest a mortgage loan will be specially serviced and the special servicer will be entitled to compensation for special servicing activities the right to receive interest on advances or special servicing compensation is senior to the rights of certificateholders to receive distributions on the offered certificates the payment of interest on advances and the payment of compensation to the special servicer may lead to shortfalls in amounts otherwise distributable on your certificates   bankruptcy of a servicer may adversely affect collections on the mortgage loans and the ability to replace the servicer   the master servicer or the special servicer may be eligible to become a debtor under the federal bankruptcy code or enter into receivership under the federal deposit insurance act        “fdia” if a master servicer or special servicer as applicable were to become a debtor under the federal bankruptcy code or enter into receivership under the fdia although the pooling and servicing agreement provides that such an event would entitle the issuing entity to terminate the master servicer or special servicer as applicable the provision would most likely not be enforceable however a rejection of the pooling and servicing agreement by a master servicer or special servicer as applicable in a bankruptcy proceeding or repudiation of the pooling and servicing agreement in a receivership under the fdia would be treated as a breach of the pooling and servicing agreement and give the issuing entity a claim for damages and the ability to appoint a successor master servicer or special servicer as applicable an assumption under the federal bankruptcy code would require the master servicer or special servicer as applicable to cure its prebankruptcy defaults if any and demonstrate that it is able to perform following assumption the bankruptcy court may permit the master servicer or special servicer as applicable to assume the servicing agreement and assign it to a third party an insolvency by an entity governed by state insolvency law would vary depending on the laws of the particular state we cannot assure you that a bankruptcy or receivership of the master servicer or special servicer as applicable would not adversely impact the servicing of the mortgage loans or the issuing entity would be entitled to terminate the master servicer or special servicer as applicable in a timely manner or at all   if any master servicer or special servicer as applicable becomes the subject of bankruptcy or similar proceedings the issuing entity claim to collections in that master servicer or special servicer’s as applicable possession at the time of the bankruptcy filing or other similar filing may not be perfected in this event funds available to pay principal and interest on your certificates may be delayed or reduced   the sponsors the depositor and the issuing entity are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws that may affect the issuing entity’s ownership of the mortgage loans   in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a sponsor or the depositor it is possible the issuing entity’s right to payment from or ownership of the mortgage loans could be challenged and if such challenge were successful delays reductions in payments andor losses on the certificates could occur   the transfer of the mortgage loans by the sponsors in connection with this offering is not expected to qualify for the securitization safe harbor adopted by the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” for securitizations sponsored by insured depository institutions however the safe harbor is nonexclusive   in the case of each sponsor an opinion of counsel will be rendered on the closing date based on certain facts and assumptions and subject to certain qualifications to the effect that the transfer of the related mortgage loans by such sponsor to the depositor would generally be respected in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of such sponsor a legal opinion is not a guaranty as to what any particular court would actually decide but rather an opinion as to the decision a court would reach if the issues are competently presented and the court followed existing precedent as to legal and equitable principles applicable in bankruptcy cases in any event we cannot assure you that the federal deposit insurance corporation a bankruptcy trustee or another interested party as applicable would not attempt to assert that such transfer was not a sale even if a challenge were not successful it is possible that payments on the certificates would be delayed while a court resolves the claim        in addition since the issuing entity is a common law trust it may not be eligible for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws unless it can be characterized as a “business trust” for purposes of the federal bankruptcy laws bankruptcy courts look at various considerations in making this determination so it is not possible to predict with any certainty whether or not the issuing entity would be characterized as a “business trust” regardless of whether a bankruptcy court ultimately determines that the issuing entity is a “business trust” it is possible that payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while the court resolved the issue   title ii of the doddfrank act provides for an orderly liquidation authority “ola” under which the fdic can be appointed as receiver of certain systemically important nonbank financial companies and their direct or indirect subsidiaries in certain cases we make no representation as to whether this would apply to any of the sponsors in january  the thenacting general counsel of the fdic issued a letter the “acting general counsel’s letter” in which he expressed his view that under thenexisting regulations the fdic as receiver under the ola would not in the exercise of its ola repudiation powers recover as property of a financial company assets transferred by the financial company provided that the transfer satisfies the conditions for the exclusion of assets from the financial company’s estate under the federal bankruptcy code the letter further noted that while the fdic staff may be considering recommending further regulations under ola the acting general counsel would recommend that such regulations incorporate a day transition period for any provisions affecting the fdic’s statutory power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts if however the fdic were to adopt a different approach than that described in the acting general counsel’s letter delays or reductions in payments on the offered certificates would occur   the requirement of the special servicer to obtain firreacompliant appraisals may result in an increased cost to the issuing entity   each appraisal obtained pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement is required to contain a statement or is accompanied by a letter from the appraiser to the effect that the appraisal was performed in accordance with the requirements of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  “firrea” as in effect on the date such appraisal was obtained any such appraisal is likely to be more expensive than an appraisal that is not firrea compliant such increased cost could result in losses to the issuing entity additionally firrea compliant appraisals are required to assume a value determined by a typically motivated buyer and seller and could result in a higher appraised value than one not prepared assuming a forced liquidation or other distress situation in addition because a firrea compliant appraisal may result in a higher valuation than a nonfirrea compliant appraisal there may be a delay in calculating and applying appraisal reductions which could result in the holders of a given class of certificates continuing to hold the full nonnotionally reduced amount of such certificates for a longer period of time than would be the case if a nonfirrea compliant appraisal were obtained   tax matters and changes in tax law may adversely impact the mortgage loans or your investment   tax considerations relating to foreclosure   if the issuing entity acquires a mortgaged property or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan a beneficial interest in a mortgaged property subsequent to a default on the related mortgage loan pursuant to a foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure the special servicer or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan the related nonserviced special servicer would be required to retain an independent contractor to operate and        manage such mortgaged property among other items the independent contractor generally will not be able to perform construction work other than repair maintenance or certain types of tenant buildouts unless the construction was more than  completed when the mortgage loan defaulted or when the default of the mortgage loan became imminent generally any i net income from such operation other than qualifying “rents from real property” ii rental income based on the net profits of a tenant or subtenant or allocable to a service that is noncustomary in the area and for the type of property involved and iii rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property if the rent attributable to the personal property exceeds  of the total rent for the taxable year will subject the lowertier remic to federal tax and possibly state or local tax on such income at the highest marginal corporate tax rate no determination has been made whether any portion of the income from the mortgaged properties constitutes “rent from real property” any such imposition of tax will reduce the net proceeds available for distribution to certificateholders the special servicer or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan the related nonserviced special servicer may permit the lowertier remic to earn “net income from foreclosure property” that is subject to tax if it determines that the net aftertax benefit to holders of certificates and any related companion loan holders as a collective whole could reasonably be expected to be greater than under another method of operating or leasing the mortgaged property see “pooling and servicing agreement—realization upon mortgage loans” in addition if the issuing entity were to acquire one or more mortgaged properties or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan a beneficial interest in a mortgaged property pursuant to a foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure upon acquisition of those mortgaged properties or in the case of a nonserviced mortgage loan a beneficial interest in a mortgaged property the issuing entity may in certain jurisdictions particularly in new york be required to pay state or local transfer or excise taxes upon liquidation of such properties such state or local taxes may reduce net proceeds available for distribution to the certificateholders   remic status   if an entity intended to qualify as a remic fails to satisfy one or more of the remic provisions of the code during any taxable year the code provides that such entity will not be treated as a remic for such year and any year thereafter in such event the relevant entity would likely be treated as an association taxable as a corporation under the united states internal revenue code if designated portions of the issuing entity are so treated the offered certificates may be treated as stock interests in an association and not as debt instruments   material federal tax considerations regarding original issue discount   one or more classes of offered certificates may be issued with “original issue discount” for federal income tax purposes which generally would result in the holder recognizing taxable income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income accordingly investors must have sufficient sources of cash to pay any federal state or local income taxes with respect to the original issue discount in addition such original issue discount will be required to be accrued and included in income based on the assumption that no defaults will occur and no losses will be incurred with respect to the mortgage loans this could lead to the inclusion of amounts in ordinary income early in the term of the certificate that later prove uncollectible giving rise to a bad debt deduction in the alternative an investor may be required to treat such uncollectible amount as a capital loss under code section         description of the mortgage pool   general   the assets of the issuing entity will consist of a pool of  fixed rate mortgage loans the “mortgage loans” or collectively the “mortgage pool” with an aggregate principal balance as of the cutoff date of  the “initial pool balance” the “cutoff date” means the respective due dates for such mortgage loans in december  or in the case of any mortgage loan that has its first due date in january  the date that would have been its due date in december  under the terms of such mortgage loan if a monthly debt service payment were scheduled to be due in that month   six  of the mortgage loans representing approximately  of the initial pool balance are each part of a larger whole loan each of which is comprised of the related mortgage loan and one or more loans that are pari passu in right of payment to the related mortgage loan collectively referred to in this prospectus as “companion loans” or “pari passu companion loans” or each a “companion loan” or “pari passu companion loan” as applicable each such mortgage loan and any related companion loan is collectively referred to as a “whole loan” each companion loan is secured by the same mortgage and the same single assignment of leases and rents securing the related mortgage loan see “—the whole loans” below for more information regarding the rights of the holders of the companion loans and the servicing and administration of the whole loans that will not be serviced under the psa as defined in “description of the certificates—general” in this prospectus for this transaction   the mortgage loans and whole loans were originated or acquired by the mortgage

real property each a “mortgaged property”   the mortgage loans are generally nonrecourse loans in the event of a borrower default on a nonrecourse mortgage loan recourse may be had only against the specific mortgaged property and the other limited assets securing such mortgage loan and not against the related borrower’s other assets the mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed by the sponsors the mortgage loan sellers or any other person or entity unrelated to the respective borrower you should consider all of the mortgage loans to be nonrecourse loans as to which recourse in the case of default will be limited to the specific property and other assets if any pledged to secure the related mortgage loan   certain calculations and definitions   this prospectus sets forth certain information with respect to the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties the sum in any column of the tables presented in annex a or annex a may not equal the indicated total due to rounding the information in annex a with respect to the mortgage loans or whole loans if applicable and the mortgaged properties is based upon the pool of the mortgage loans as it is expected to be constituted as of the close of business on december   the “closing date” assuming that i all scheduled principal and interest payments due on or before the cutoff date will be made and ii there will be no principal prepayments on or before the closing date the statistics in annex a annex a and annex a were primarily derived from information provided to the depositor by each sponsor which information may have been obtained from the borrowers   all percentages of the mortgage loans and mortgaged properties or of any specified group of mortgage loans and mortgaged properties referred to in this prospectus without further description are approximate percentages of the initial pool balance by cutoff date balances andor the allocated loan amount allocated to such mortgaged properties as of the cutoff date   all information presented in this prospectus with respect to each mortgage loan with one or more pari passu companion loans is calculated in a manner that reflects the aggregate indebtedness evidenced by that mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion loans unless otherwise indicated   definitions   for purposes of this prospectus including the information presented in the annexes the indicated terms have the following meanings   “adr” means for any hotel property average daily rate        “annual debt service” generally means for any mortgage loan  times the average of the principal and interest payments for the first  payment periods of the mortgage loan following the cutoff date provided that   ·in the case of a mortgage loan that provides for interestonly payments through maturity the aggregate interest payments scheduled to be due on the due date following the cutoff date and the  due dates thereafter for such mortgage loan and   ·in the case of a mortgage loan that provides for an initial interestonly period and provides for scheduled amortization payments after the expiration of such interestonly period prior to the maturity date or the anticipated repayment date as applicable  times the monthly payment of principal and interest payable during the amortization period monthly debt service and the debt service coverage ratios are also calculated using the average of the principal and interest payments for the first twelve payment periods of the mortgage loan following the cutoff date subject to the proviso to the prior sentence in the case of any whole loan annual debt service is calculated with respect to the mortgage loan including any related companion loan annual debt service is calculated with regard to the related mortgage loan included in the issuing entity only unless otherwise indicated   “appraised value” means for any mortgaged property the appraiser’s adjusted value of such mortgaged property as determined by the most recent third party appraisal of the mortgaged property available to the related mortgage loan seller as set forth under “appraised value” on annex a the appraised value set forth on annex a is the “asis” value unless otherwise specified in this prospectus on annex a andor the related footnotes in certain cases the appraisals state an “asstabilized” “ascomplete” “asrepaired” “hypothetical” or “asrenovated” value as well as the “asis” value for the related mortgaged property that assume that certain events will occur with respect to the retenanting construction renovation or repairs at such mortgaged property in most such cases the related mortgage loan seller has taken reserves sufficient to complete such retenanting construction renovation or repairs we make no representation that sufficient amounts have been reserved or that the appraised value would approximate either the value that would be determined in a current appraisal of the related mortgaged property or the amount that would be realized upon a sale in addition with respect to mortgage loans secured by portfolios of mortgaged properties the appraised value may represent the “asis” “ascomplete” “asrenovated” or “asstabilized” value for the related portfolio of mortgaged properties as a collective whole which is generally higher than the aggregate of the “asis” “ascomplete” “asrenovated” or “asstabilized” appraised values of the related individual mortgaged properties for example in the case of the mortgage loan identified as heritage industrial portfolio on annex a to this prospectus representing approximately  of the initial pool balance the “asis” appraised value of  reflects a premium attributed to the value of the related mortgaged properties as a whole the sum of the individual appraised values of each of the related mortgaged properties is  in the case of certain of the mortgage loans the ltv ratio for such mortgage loans has been calculated based on the “ascomplete” or “asstabilized” appraised value of the related mortgaged property and in certain other cases based on an appraised value that includes certain property that does not qualify as real property with respect to any mortgage loan that is a part of a whole loan the appraised value is based on the appraised value of the related mortgaged property that secures the entire whole loan   “balloon balance” means with respect to any mortgage loan the principal amount that will be due at maturity or in the case of any ard loan at the related anticipated        repayment date for such mortgage loan assuming no payment defaults or principal prepayments   “cash flow analysis” is with respect to one or more of the mortgaged properties securing a mortgage loan among the  largest mortgage loans or groups of crosscollateralized mortgage loans a summary presentation of certain adjusted historical financial information provided by the related borrower and a calculation of the underwritten net cash flow expressed as a “effective gross income” minus b “total expenses” and underwritten replacement reserves and if applicable tenant improvements and leasing commissions for this purpose   ·“effective gross income” means with respect to any mortgaged property the revenue derived from the use and operation of that property less allowances for vacancies concessions and credit losses the “revenue” component of such calculation was generally determined on the basis of the information described with respect to the “revenue” component described under “underwritten net cash flow” below in general any nonrecurring revenue items and nonproperty related revenue are eliminated from the calculation of effective gross income   ·“total expenses” means with respect to any mortgaged property all operating expenses associated with that property including but not limited to utilities administrative expenses repairs and maintenance management fees advertising costs insurance premiums real estate taxes and if applicable ground rent such expenses were generally determined on the basis of the same information as the “expense” component described under “underwritten net cash flow” below   to the extent available selected historical income expenses and net income associated with the operation of the related mortgaged property securing each mortgage loan appear in each cash flow summary contained in annex a to this prospectus such information is one of the sources but not the only source of information on which calculations of underwritten net cash flow are based the historical information presented is derived from audited andor unaudited financial statements provided by the borrowers the historical information in the cash flow summaries reflects adjustments made by the mortgage loan seller to exclude certain items contained in the related financial statements that were not considered in calculating underwritten net cash flow and is presented in a different format from the financial statements to show a comparison to the underwritten net cash flow in general solely for purposes of the presentation of historical financial information the amount set forth under the caption “gross income” consists of the “total revenues” set forth in the applicable financial statements including as and to the extent stated rental revenues tenant reimbursements and recovery income and in the case of hospitality properties and certain other property types parking income telephone income food and beverage income laundry income and other income with adjustments to exclude amounts recognized on the financial statements under a straightline method of recognizing rental income including increases in minimum rents and rent abatements from operating leases over their lives and items indicated as extraordinary or onetime revenue collections or considered nonrecurring in property operations the amount set forth under the caption “expenses” in the historical financial information consists of the total expenses set forth in the applicable financial statements with adjustments to exclude allocated parent company expenses restructuring charges and charges associated with employee severance and termination benefits interest expenses paid to company affiliates or unrelated third parties charges for depreciation and amortization and items indicated as extraordinary or onetime losses or considered nonrecurring in property operations        the selected historical information presented in the cash flow summaries is derived from audited andor unaudited financial statements furnished by the respective borrowers which have not been verified by the depositor any underwriters the mortgage loan sellers or any other person audits or other verification of such financial statements could result in changes thereto which could in turn result in the historical net income presented herein being overstated or understated   “cutoff date balance” of any mortgage loan will be the unpaid principal balance of that mortgage loan as of the cutoff date for such mortgage loan after application of all payments due on or before that date whether or not received   an “ltv ratio” for any mortgage loan as of any date of determination is a fraction expressed as a percentage the numerator of which is the scheduled principal balance of the mortgage loan as of that date assuming no defaults or prepayments on the mortgage loan prior to that date and the denominator of which is the “as is” appraised value as determined by an appraisal of the mortgaged property obtained at or about the time of the origination of the related mortgage loan or in the case of the mortgage loans identified as harbor pointe apartments anchorage marriott downtown aloft nashville west end

a crosscollateralized group of mortgage loans the related ltv ratio is the fraction expressed as a percentage the numerator of which is the scheduled principal balance of all the mortgage loans in the        crosscollateralized group and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the appraised values of all the mortgaged properties related to the crosscollateralized group the ltv ratio as of the

anticipated repayment date as the case may be assuming all principal payments required to be made on or prior to the related maturity date or if applicable the anticipated repayment date in either case not including the balloon payment are made in addition because it is based on the value of a mortgaged property determined as of loan origination the information set forth in this prospectus in annex a and in annex a is not necessarily a reliable measure of the related borrower’s current equity in each mortgaged property in a declining real estate market the appraised value of a mortgaged

future market value of each property”   the characteristics described above and in annex a along with certain additional characteristics of the mortgage loans presented on a loanbyloan basis are set forth in annex a   “cutoff date loantovalue ratio” or “cutoff date ltv ratio” generally means the ratio expressed as a percentage of the cutoff date balance of a mortgage loan to the appraised value of the related mortgaged property or properties determined as described under “—appraised value” in this prospectus see also the footnotes to annex a in this prospectus because the appraised values of the mortgaged properties were determined prior to origination the information set forth in this prospectus including the annexes hereto is not necessarily a reliable measure of property value or the related borrower’s current equity in each mortgaged property in a declining real estate market the appraised value of a mortgaged property may have decreased from the appraised value determined at origination and the current actual cutoff date loantovalue ratio of a mortgage loan may be higher than the cutoff date ltv ratio that we present in this prospectus even after taking into account any amortization since origination no representation is made that any appraised value presented in this prospectus would approximate either the value that would be determined in a current appraisal of the related mortgaged property or the amount that would be realized upon a sale of that property see “risk factors—risks relating to the mortgage loans—appraisals may not reflect current or future market value of each property” in this prospectus in the case of a mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan such ltv ratio was calculated based on the aggregate principal balance of the pari passu mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion loan as of the cutoff date unless clearly indicated otherwise the cutoff date loantovalue ratio for each of the mortgage loans that is part of any group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans is calculated on the basis of the aggregate cutoff date balance of all those mortgage loans and the aggregate appraised value of all the related mortgaged properties securing the group on an individual basis without regard to the crosscollateralization feature any particular mortgage loan that is part of a group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans may have a higher and perhaps substantially higher cutoff date ltv ratio than is shown on annex a to this prospectus   “debt service coverage ratio” “dscr” “underwritten debt service coverage ratio” “uw ncf dscr” or “uw dscr” generally means the ratio of the underwritten net cash        flow for the related mortgaged property or mortgaged properties to the annual debt service as shown on annex a to this prospectus   in the case of a mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan such debt service coverage ratio was calculated based on the aggregate annual debt service of the pari passu mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion loan   unless clearly indicated otherwise the underwritten debt service coverage ratio for each of the mortgage loans that is part of any group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans is calculated on the basis of the aggregate underwritten net cash flow generated by all the mortgaged properties securing the group and the aggregate annual debt service payable under all of those mortgage loans on an individual basis without regard to the crosscollateralization feature any particular mortgage loan that is part of a group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans may have a lower and perhaps substantially lower underwritten debt service coverage ratio than is shown on annex a to this prospectus   in general debt service coverage ratios are used by income property lenders to measure the ratio of a cash currently generated by a property or expected to be generated by a property based upon executed leases that is available for debt service to b required debt service payments however debt service coverage ratios only measure the current or recent ability of a property to service mortgage debt if a property does not possess a stable operating expectancy for instance if it is subject to material leases that are scheduled to expire during the loan term and that provide for abovemarket rents andor that may be difficult to replace a debt service coverage ratio may not be a reliable indicator of a property’s ability to service the mortgage debt over the entire remaining loan term see “underwritten net cash flow” below   the underwritten debt service coverage ratios presented in this prospectus appear for illustrative purposes only and as discussed above are limited in their usefulness in assessing the current or predicting the future ability of a mortgaged property or mortgaged properties to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the related mortgage loan no representation is made that the underwritten debt service coverage ratios presented in this prospectus accurately reflect that ability   “gla” means gross leasable area   “inplace cash management” means for funds directed into a lockbox such funds are generally not made immediately available to the related borrower but instead are forwarded to a cash management account controlled by the lender and the funds are disbursed according to the related mortgage loan documents with any

basis   “loan per unit” means the principal balance per unit of measure as applicable as of the cutoff date with respect to any mortgage loan that is part of a split loan structure the loan per unit is calculated with regard to both the related pari passu companion loan and the related mortgage loan included in the issuing entity unless otherwise indicated with respect to any mortgage loan contained in any group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans the loan per unit is calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal balances of all mortgage loans comprising such group   “ltv ratio at maturity or ard” “ltv ratio at maturity or anticipated repayment date” and “balloon or ard ltv ratio” generally means the ratio expressed as a percentage of        a the principal balance of a balloon mortgage loan scheduled to be outstanding on the stated maturity date or in the case of an ard loan scheduled to be outstanding on the anticipated repayment date assuming among other things no prepayments or defaults to b the appraised value of the related mortgaged property or mortgaged properties determined as described under “—appraised value” each mortgage loan requires that a regular monthly debt service payment be made on the stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable and accordingly the principal balance referenced in clause a of the immediately preceding sentence will be net of the principal portion if any of the monthly debt service payment due on such date because the appraised values of the mortgaged properties were determined prior to origination the information set forth in this prospectus including the annexes hereto is not necessarily a reliable measure of the related borrower’s current equity in each mortgaged property in a declining real estate market the appraised value of a mortgaged property may have decreased from the appraised value determined at origination and the actual loantovalue ratio at maturity of a mortgage loan may be higher than the ltv ratio at maturity or ard that we present in this prospectus see “risk factors—risks relating to the mortgage loans—appraisals may not reflect current or future market value of each property” in this prospectus in the case of each mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan unless otherwise indicated such loantovalue ratio was calculated based on the aggregate principal balance that will be due at maturity with respect to such pari passu mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion loan unless clearly indicated otherwise the ltv ratio at maturity or ard for each of the mortgage loans that is part of any group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans is calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal balance of all those mortgage loans scheduled to be outstanding on

without regard to the crosscollateralization feature any particular mortgage loan that is part of a group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans may have a higher and perhaps substantially higher ltv ratio at maturity or ard than is shown on annex a to this prospectus   “maturity date balloon or ard payment” or “balloon or ard payment” means for any balloon mortgage loan or ard loan the payment of principal due upon its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date each mortgage loan requires that a regular monthly debt service payment be made on the stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable and accordingly the payment of principal referenced in the immediately preceding sentence will be net of the principal portion if any of the monthly debt service payment due on such date   “net operating income” generally means for any given period ending on the “noi date” the total operating revenues derived from a mortgaged property during that period minus the total operating expenses incurred in respect of that mortgaged property during that period other than   ·noncash items such as depreciation and amortization   ·capital expenditures and   ·debt service on the related mortgage loan or on any other loans that are secured by that mortgaged property   “nra” means net rentable area   “occupancy rate” means i in the case of multifamily rental properties other than residential cooperative properties and manufactured housing community properties the        percentage of rental units or pads as applicable that are rented generally without regard to the

the date of determination subject to in the case of certain mortgage loans one or more of the additional leaseup assumptions iii in the case of hospitality properties the percentage of available rooms occupied for the trailing month period ending on the date of determination iv in the case of self storage facilities either the percentage of the net rentable square footage rented or the percentage of units rented as of the date of determination depending on borrower reporting and v in the case of residential cooperative properties the property vacancy assumption reflected in the related appraisal for purposes of determining the appraised value of the related mortgaged property as a multifamily rental property ie the “cooprental value” reflected in annex a to this prospectus such vacancy assumption for residential cooperative properties does not reflect actual occupancy in the case of some of the mortgage loans the calculation of occupancy rate for one or more related properties was based on assumptions regarding occupancy such as the assumption that a particular tenant at the subject mortgaged property that has executed a lease but has not yet taken occupancy andor has not yet commenced paying rent will take occupancy on a future date generally expected to occur within  months of the cutoff date assumptions regarding the renewal of particular leases andor the releasing of certain space at the subject mortgaged property and certain additional leaseup assumptions as may be described in the footnotes to annex a to this prospectus   “occupancy as of date” means the date of determination of the occupancy rate of a mortgaged property with respect to a residential cooperative mortgage loan the occupancy as of date is the date of the related appraisal from which the occupancy rate is derived   “prepayment provisions” denotes a general summary of the provisions of a mortgage loan that restrict the ability of the related borrower to voluntarily prepay the mortgage loan in each case some exceptions may apply that are not described in the general summary such as provisions that permit a voluntary partial prepayment in connection with the release of a portion of a mortgaged property or require the application of tenant holdback reserves to a partial prepayment in each case notwithstanding any lockout period or yield maintenance charge that may otherwise apply in describing prepayment provisions we use the following symbols with the indicated meanings   ·“d”means with respect to any mortgage loan a specified number of monthly payment periods

permitted with the payment of a yield maintenance charge and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment   ·“d or ” means with respect to any mortgage loan a specified number of monthly payment periods which number is denoted by a numeric value  during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that mortgage loan in order to obtain a release of the related

an estimate of a operating expenses such as utilities administrative expenses repairs and maintenance management and franchise fees and advertising and b estimated fixed expenses such as insurance real estate taxes and if applicable ground space or air rights lease payments as determined by the related mortgage loan seller and generally derived from historical expenses at the mortgaged property the borrower’s budget or appraiser’s estimate in some cases adjusted for        significant occupancy increases and a market rate management fee and subject to certain assumptions and subjective judgments of each mortgage loan seller as described under the definition of “underwritten net operating income” above   “underwritten net cash flow” “underwritten ncf” or “uw ncf” means an amount based on assumptions relating to cash flow available for debt service in general it is the underwritten net operating income less all reserves for capital expenditures including tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions underwritten net cash flow generally does not reflect interest expenses noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and other nonreoccurring expenses   in determining the “revenue” component of underwritten net cash flow for each mortgaged property other than a residential cooperative property the related mortgage loan seller generally relied on a rent roll andor other known signed tenant leases executed extension options property financial statements estimates in the related appraisal or other indications of anticipated income generally supported by market considerations cash reserves or letters of credit supplied by the related borrower and where the actual vacancy shown thereon and if available the market vacancy was less than  assumed a minimum  vacancy in determining revenue from rents in certain cases inclusive of rents under master leases with an affiliate of the borrower that relate to space not used or occupied by the master lease tenant or in the case of a hotel property room rent food and beverage revenues and other hotel property income except that in the case of certain nonmultifamily and nonmanufactured housing community properties space occupied by such anchor or single tenants or other large creditworthy tenants may have been disregarded or a rate of less than  has been assumed in performing the vacancy adjustment due to the length of the related leases or creditworthiness of such tenants where the actual or market vacancy was greater than  the mortgage loan seller determined revenue from rents in certain cases inclusive of rents under master leases with an affiliate of the borrower that relate to space not used or occupied by the master lease tenant or in the case of a hotel property room rent food and beverage revenues and other hotel property income by generally relying on a rent roll andor other known signed leases executed lease extension options property financial statements estimates in the related appraisal or other indications of anticipated income generally supported by market considerations cash reserves or letters of credit supplied and generally but not in all cases the greatest of a actual current vacancy at the related mortgaged property or a vacancy otherwise based on performance of the related mortgaged property eg an economic vacancy based on actual collections for a specified trailing period b if available current vacancy according to thirdpartyprovided market information or at comparable properties in the same or similar market as the related mortgaged property subject to adjustment to address special considerations such as where market vacancy may have been ignored with respect to space covered by longterm leases or because it was deemed inapplicable by reason of among other things below market rents at or unique characteristics of the subject mortgaged property andor to reflect the appraiser’s conclusion of a supportable or stabilized occupancy rate and c subject to the discussion above  in some cases involving a multiproperty mortgage loan the foregoing vacancy assumptions may be applied to the portfolio of the related mortgaged properties in the entirety but may not apply to each related mortgaged property in addition for some mortgaged properties the actual vacancy may reflect the average vacancy over the course of a year or trailing month period in determining revenue for multifamily manufactured housing community and self storage properties the mortgage loan sellers generally reviewed rental revenue shown on the rolling onetotwelve month or some combination thereof operating statements or annualized the rental revenue and reimbursement of expenses shown on rent rolls or operating statements with respect to the        prior onetotwelvemonth periods in the case of hospitality properties gross receipts were generally determined based upon the average occupancy not to exceed  and daily rates based on thirdpartyprovided market information or average daily rates achieved during the prior onetothree year annual reporting period   in determining the “expense” component of underwritten net cash flow for each mortgaged property the related mortgage loan seller generally relied on to the extent available historical operating statements fullyear or yeartodate financial statements rolling month operating statements yeartodate financial statements andor budgets supplied by the related borrower as well as estimates in the related appraisal except that i if tax or insurance expense information more current than that reflected in the financial statements was available and verified the newer information was generally used ii property management fees were generally assumed to be  to  depending on the property type of effective gross revenue or in the case of a hospitality property gross receipts iii in general depending on the property type assumptions were made with respect to the average amount of reserves for leasing commissions tenant improvement expenses and capital expenditures iv expenses were assumed to include annual replacement reserves and v recent changes in circumstances at the mortgaged properties were taken into account for example physical changes that would be expected to reduce utilities costs annual replacement reserves were generally underwritten to the suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent thirdparty property condition or engineering report or minimum requirements by property type designated by the mortgage loan seller and are a in the case of retail office self storage and industrialwarehouse properties generally not more than  per square foot of net rentable commercial area and may be zero b in the case of multifamily rental apartments generally not more than approximately  per residential unit per year depending on the condition of the property and may be zero c in the case of manufactured housing community properties generally not more than approximately  per pad per year depending on the condition of the property and may be zero and d in the case of hospitality properties generally  to  inclusive of gross revenues and may be zero in addition in some cases the mortgage loan seller recharacterized as capital expenditures items that are reported by borrowers as operating expenses thus increasing the “net cash flow”   historical operating results may not be available for mortgaged properties with newly constructed improvements mortgaged properties with triplenet leases mortgaged properties that have recently undergone substantial renovations and newly acquired mortgaged properties in such cases items of revenue and expense used in calculating underwritten net cash flow were generally derived from rent rolls estimates set forth in the related appraisal leases with tenants other thirdpartyprovided market information or from other borrowersupplied information we cannot assure you with respect to the accuracy of the information provided by any borrowers or the adequacy of the procedures used by the related mortgage loan seller in determining the presented operating information   for purposes of calculating underwritten net cash flow for mortgage loans where leases have been executed by one or more affiliates of the borrower the rents under some of such leases if applicable have been adjusted downward to reflect market rents for similar properties if the rent actually paid under the lease was significantly higher than the market rent for similar properties   the amounts described as revenue and expense above are often highly subjective values in the case of some of the mortgage loans the calculation of underwritten net cash flow for the related mortgaged properties was based on assumptions regarding projected rental income expenses andor occupancy including without limitation one or more of the        following i the assumption that a particular tenant at a mortgaged property that has executed a lease or letter of intent but has not yet taken occupancy andor has not yet commenced paying rent will take occupancy and commence paying rent on a future date generally expected to occur within  months of the cutoff date ii the assumption that certain rental income that is to be payable commencing on a future date under a signed lease but where the subject tenant is in an initial rent abatement or free rent period will be paid commencing on such future date iii assumptions regarding the probability of renewal or extension of particular leases andor the releasing of certain space at a mortgaged property and the anticipated effect on capital and releasing expenditures iv assumptions regarding the costs and expenses including leasing commissions and tenant improvements associated with leasing vacant space or releasing occupied space at a future date and v assumptions regarding future increases or decreases in expenses or whether certain expenses are capital expenses or should be treated as expenses which are not recurring in addition in the case of some commercial properties the underwritten revenues were adjusted upward to account for a portion or average of the additional rents provided for under any rent stepups scheduled to occur over the terms of the executed leases we cannot assure you that the assumptions made with respect to any mortgage loan will in fact be consistent with actual property performance actual annual net cash flow for a mortgaged property may be less than the underwritten net cash flow presented with respect to that property in this prospectus in addition the underwriting analysis of any particular mortgage loan as described herein by a particular mortgage loan seller may not conform to an analysis of the same property by other persons or entities   see “risk factors—risks relating to the mortgage loans—underwritten net cash flow could be based on incorrect or failed assumptions” in

debt service on such mortgage loan except that the underwritten net cash flow debt service coverage ratios for all partial interestonly loans if any was calculated based on the first principal and interest payment required to be made to the issuing entity during the term of the mortgage loan however in the case of a mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan unless otherwise indicated such debt service coverage ratio was calculated based on the aggregate annual debt service of the pari passu mortgage loan and each related pari passu companion loan as of the cutoff date the underwritten net cash flow debt service coverage ratio for all interestonly loans were calculated based on the sum of the first  interest payments following the cutoff date unless clearly indicated otherwise the underwritten net cash flow debt service coverage ratio for each mortgage loan that is part of any group of crosscollateralized mortgage loans is equal to the underwritten ncf of all the mortgaged properties securing the group divided by the aggregate annual debt service of all the mortgage loans in the group on an individual basis without regard to the crosscollateralization feature any

of the cash flow available for debt service before deductions for capital expenditures including replacement reserves tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions in general underwritten net operating income is the assumed revenue derived from the use and operation of a mortgaged property consisting primarily of rental income less the sum of a assumed operating expenses such as utilities administrative expenses repairs and maintenance management fees and advertising and b fixed expenses such as insurance real estate taxes and if applicable ground lease payments underwritten net operating income is generally estimated in the same manner as underwritten net cash flow except that no deduction is made for capital expenditures including replacement reserves tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions see “risk factors—risks relating to the mortgage loans—underwritten net cash flow could be based on incorrect or failed assumptions” in this prospectus   the “underwritten net operating income debt service coverage ratio” or “uw noi dscr” for any mortgage loan for any period as presented in this prospectus including the tables presented on annex a and annex a is the ratio of underwritten noi calculated for the related mortgaged property to the amount of total annual debt service on such mortgage loan except that the underwritten net operating income debt service coverage ratio for all partial interestonly loans if any was calculated based on the first principal and interest payment required to be made to the issuing entity during the term

typically must i be written by a title insurer licensed to do business in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located ii be in an amount at least equal to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan iii provide protection and benefits that run to the mortgagee and its successors and assigns iv be written on an american land title association form or equivalent policy

and iii if there is a low loantovalue ratio provided that in each case the borrower will generally be required to submit evidence of payment of annual property insurance premiums   ·replacement reserves replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the components of the mortgaged property during the term of the mortgage loan annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the suggested replacement reserve amount from a third party property condition or engineering report or to certain minimum requirements by property type such escrows may not be required under certain circumstances including but not limited to i if a single or investment grade tenant which may be a ground lease tenant is responsible for all repairs and maintenance under the terms of its lease and ii if there is a low loantovalue ratio   ·completion repairenvironmental remediation typically a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where an environmental or property condition report suggests that a reserve is necessary upon funding of the mortgage loan principal commercial capital generally requires that at least  of the        estimated cost identified in the environmental or property condition report be reserved and that repairs or replacements be completed within one year after the funding of the applicable mortgage loan such escrows may not be required under certain circumstances including but not limited to i if the sponsor of the borrower delivers a guarantee to complete the immediate repairs in a specified amount

in most cases various tenants have lease expirations within the mortgage loan term to mitigate this risk with respect to industrial retail and office properties special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan andor during the related mortgage loan term or a letter of credit andor a cash flow sweep or a combination of any of the aforementioned alternatives may be used to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs that might be associated with releasing the space occupied by such tenants such escrows may not be required under certain circumstances including but not limited to i if rent at the mortgaged property is considered below market and ii if no material leases expire within the mortgage loan term   furthermore principal commercial capital may accept an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower its sponsor or an affiliate or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being addressed in addition under certain circumstances where i positive credit characteristics exist ii the amounts involved are relatively minimal or iii principal commercial capital has determined the mortgaged property the borrower or its owners will likely be able to bear the related expenses without the escrow or reserve an escrow or reserve may not be required   exceptions one or more of the mortgage loans originated by macquarie investments us inc dba principal commercial capital or macquarie

of certain general underwriting guidelines and processes with respect to commercial multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans originated by lcf and its affiliates for securitization   notwithstanding the discussion below given the unique nature of commercial multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgaged properties the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with respect to any particular commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan may significantly differ from one loan to another and will be driven by circumstances particular to that property including among others its type current use size location market conditions reserve requirements and additional collateral tenants and leases borrower identity sponsorship performance history andor other factors consequently there can be no assurance that the underwriting of any particular commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan originated by lcf or one of its affiliates will conform to the general guidelines and processes described below for important information about the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of particular lcf mortgage loans see “description of the mortgage pool—exceptions to underwriting guidelines” in this prospectus and “annex d—exceptions to mortgage loan representations and warranties” in this prospectus   loan analysis generally both a credit analysis and a collateral analysis are conducted with respect to each commercial multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loan the credit analysis of the borrower generally includes a review of third party credit reports or judgment lien bankruptcy and pending litigation searches such searches are limited in the time periods that they cover and often cover no more than the prior year period furthermore in the case of equity holders in the borrowers such searches would generally be conducted only as to equity holders with at least a  interest in the subject borrower or that control the subject borrower the collateral analysis generally includes a review of in each case to the extent available and applicable the historical property operating statements rent rolls and certain significant tenant leases the credit underwriting also generally includes a review of third party appraisals as well as environmental reports engineering assessments and seismic reports if applicable and obtained generally the originator also conducts or causes a third party to conduct a site inspection to ascertain the overall quality functionality and competitiveness of the property including its neighborhood and market accessibility and visibility and to assess the tenancy of the property the submarket in which the property is located is assessed to evaluate the competitive or comparable properties as well as market trends   loan approval prior to commitment each commercial multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loan to be originated must be approved by a loan committee        that includes senior personnel from the ladder capital group the committee may approve a mortgage loan as recommended request additional due diligence modify the loan terms or decline a loan transaction   debt service coverage ratio and loantovalue ratio the underwriting includes a calculation of the debt service coverage ratio and loantovalue ratio in connection with the origination of a loan with respect to loans originated for securitization the ladder capital group’s underwriting standards generally require without regard to any other debt a debt service coverage ratio of not less than x and a loantovalue ratio of not more than    a debt service coverage ratio will generally be calculated based on the underwritten net cash flow from the property in question as determined by the ladder capital group and payments on the loan based on actual or in some cases assumed principal andor interest due on the loan however underwritten net cash flow is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions regarding and adjustments to revenues and expenses with respect to the related real property collateral for example when calculating the debt service coverage ratio for a commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan annual net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected future rental income expenses andor occupancy may be utilized there is no assurance that the foregoing assumptions made with respect to any prospective commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan will in fact be consistent with actual property performance such underwritten net cash flow may be higher than historical net cash flow reflected in recent financial statements additionally certain mortgage loans may provide for only interest payments prior to maturity or for an interestonly period during a portion of the term of the mortgage loan a loantovalue ratio in general is the ratio expressed as a percentage of the thenoutstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan divided by the estimated value of the related property based on an appraisal   additional debt certain mortgage loans originated by lcf or one of its affiliates may have or permit in the future certain additional subordinate debt whether secured or unsecured andor mezzanine debt it is possible that a member of the ladder capital group may be the lender on that additional subordinate debt andor mezzanine debt   the debt service coverage ratios described above will be lower based on the inclusion of the payments related to such additional debt and the loantovalue ratios described above will be higher based on the inclusion of the amount of any such additional subordinate debt andor mezzanine debt   assessments of property condition as part of the underwriting process the property assessments and reports described below will typically be obtained   ·appraisals independent appraisals or an update of an independent appraisal will generally be required in connection with the origination of each mortgage loan that meets the requirements of the “uniform standards of professional appraisal practice” as adopted by the appraisal standards board of the appraisal foundation or the guidelines in title xi of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  in some cases however the value of the subject real property collateral may be established based on a cash flow analysis a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation   ·environmental assessment in most cases a phase i environmental assessment will be required with respect to the real property collateral for a prospective        commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan however when circumstances warrant an update of a prior environmental assessment a transaction screen or a desktop review may be utilized alternatively in limited circumstances an environmental assessment may not be required such as when the benefits of an environmental insurance policy or an environmental guarantee have been obtained furthermore an environmental assessment conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily cover all potential environmental issues for example an analysis for radon leadbased paint mold and lead in drinking water will usually be conducted only at multifamily rental properties and only when the originator or an environmental consultant believes that such an analysis is warranted under the circumstances depending on the findings of the initial environmental assessment any of the following may be required additional environmental testing such as a phase ii environmental assessment with respect to the subject real property collateral an environmental insurance policy that the borrower conduct remediation activities or establish an operations and maintenance plan andor a guaranty or reserve with respect to environmental matters   ·     engineering assessment in connection with the origination process in most cases it will be required that an engineering firm inspect the real property collateral for any prospective commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan to assess the structure exterior walls roofing interior structure andor mechanical and electrical systems based on the resulting report the appropriate response will be determined to any recommended repairs corrections or replacements and any identified deferred maintenance an engineering assessment may not be conducted with respect to a mortgaged property that lacks material improvements owned by the related borrower   ·     seismic report generally a seismic report is required for all properties located in seismic zones  or  a seismic study may not be conducted with respect to a mortgaged property that lacks material improvements owned by the related borrower   notwithstanding the foregoing engineering inspections and seismic reports will generally not be required or obtained by the originator in connection with the origination process in the case of mortgage loans secured by real properties that are subject to a ground lease triplenet lease or other long term lease or in the case of mortgage loans that are not collateralized by any material improvements on the real property collateral   title insurance the borrower is required to provide and the ladder capital group or its origination counsel typically will review a title insurance policy for each property the title insurance policies provided typically must meet the following requirements i written by a title insurer licensed to do business in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located ii in an amount at least equal to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan iii protection and benefits run to the mortgagee and its successors and assigns iv written on an american land title association form or equivalent policy promulgated in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located and v if a survey was prepared the legal description of the mortgaged property in the title policy conforms to that shown on the survey   casualty insurance except in certain instances where sole or significant tenants which may include ground tenants are permitted to obtain insurance or selfinsure or where another third party unrelated to the applicable borrower such as a condominium association franchisor or third party property manager if applicable is permitted to obtain         insurance or the subject mortgaged property is covered by a blanket policy which may have been obtained by an affiliate of the related borrower the ladder capital group typically requires that the related mortgaged property be insured by a hazard insurance policy with a customary deductible and in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan and  of the full insurable replacement cost of the improvements located on the property if applicable the policy contains appropriate endorsements to avoid the application of coinsurance and does not permit reduction in insurance proceeds for depreciation except that the policy may permit a deduction for depreciation in connection with a cash settlement after a casualty if the insurance proceeds are not being applied to rebuild or repair the damaged improvements   flood insurance if available must be in effect for any mortgaged property that at the time of origination included material borrowerowned improvements in any area identified in the federal register by the federal emergency management agency a special flood hazard area the flood insurance policy must meet the requirements of the thencurrent guidelines of the federal insurance administration be provided by a generally acceptable insurance carrier and be in an amount representing coverage not less than the least of i the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan ii the full insurable value of the material borrowerowned improvements at the property or in cases where only a portion of the property is in the flood zone the full insurable value of the material borrowerowned improvements at the portion of the property contained therein and iii the maximum amount of insurance available under the national flood insurance program except in some cases where selfinsurance was permitted   the standard form of hazard insurance policy typically covers physical damage or destruction of the improvements on the mortgaged property caused by fire lightning explosion smoke windstorm and hail riot or strike and civil commotion the policies may contain some conditions and exclusions to coverage including exclusions related to acts of terrorism   generally except in certain instances where sole or significant tenants which may include ground tenants are permitted to obtain insurance or selfinsure or where another third party unrelated to the applicable borrower such as a condominium association franchisor or third party property manager if applicable is permitted to obtain insurance or the subject mortgaged property is covered by a blanket policy which may have been obtained by an affiliate of the related borrower each of the mortgage loans requires that the related borrower maintain i coverage for terrorism or terrorist acts if such coverage is available at commercially reasonable rates although in many cases there is a cap on the amount that the related borrower will be required to expend on terrorism insurance ii comprehensive general liability insurance against claims for personal and bodily injury death or property damage occurring on in or about the property in an amount customarily required by institutional lenders and iii business interruption or rent loss insurance in an amount not less than  of the projected rental income from the related property for not less than  months   although properties are typically not insured for earthquake risk a borrower will be required to obtain earthquake insurance if the property has material improvements and the seismic report indicates that the probable maximum loss “pml” or scenario expected loss “sel” is greater than    zoning and building code compliance in connection with the origination of a commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan the originator will generally examine whether the use and occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning landuse building rules regulations and orders then        applicable to that property evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the following legal opinions surveys recorded documents temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy letters from government officials or agencies title insurance endorsements engineering or consulting reports zoning reports andor representations by the related borrower   in some cases a mortgaged property may constitute a legal nonconforming use or structure in such cases the ladder capital group may require an endorsement to the title insurance policy or the acquisition of law and ordinance insurance or a nonrecourse carveout in the related loan documents with respect to the particular nonconformity unless it determines that i the nonconformity should not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the borrower to rebuild or ii if the improvements are rebuilt in accordance with currently applicable law the value and performance of the property would be acceptable or iii any major casualty that would prevent rebuilding has a sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring or iv a cash reserve a letter of credit or an agreement from a principal of the borrower is provided to cover losses   if a material violation exists with respect to a mortgaged property the ladder capital group may require the borrower to remediate such violation and subject to the discussion under “—escrow requirements” below to establish a reserve to cover the cost of such remediation unless a cash reserve a letter of credit or an agreement from a principal of the borrower is provided to cover losses   escrow requirements based on the originator’s analysis of the real property collateral the borrower and the principals of the borrower a borrower under a commercial multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan may be required to fund various escrows for taxes insurance replacement reserves tenant improvementsleasing commissions depending on the property type deferred maintenance andor environmental remediation a casebycase analysis will be conducted to determine the need for a particular escrow or reserve consequently the aforementioned

strength of the borrowersponsor or any other pertinent information deemed material by cgmrc therefore this general description of cgmrc’s origination procedures and underwriting criteria is not intended as a representation that every commercial mortgage loan originated by it or on its behalf complies entirely with all criteria set forth below   process the credit underwriting process for each cgmrc loan is performed by a deal team comprised of real estate professionals which typically includes an originator an underwriter a commercial closer and a third party due diligence provider

applicable and available historical operating statements rent rolls tenant leases current and historical real estate tax information insurance policies andor schedules and third party reports pertaining to appraisalvaluation zoning environmental status and physical conditionseismic conditionengineering see “—escrow requirements” “—title insurance policy” “—property insurance” “—third party reports—appraisal” “—third party reports—environmental report” and “—third party reports—property condition report” below in some cases such as a property having a limited operating history or having been recently acquired by its current owner historical operating statements may not be available rent rolls would not be examined for certain property types such as        hospitality properties or single tenant properties and tenant leases would not be examined for certain property types such as hospitality self storage multifamily and manufactured housing community properties   a member of the

statements income tax returns credit reports criminalbackground investigations and specific searches for judgments liens bankruptcy and pending litigation circumstances may also warrant an examination of the financial strength and credit of key tenants as well as other factors that may impact the tenants’ ongoing occupancy or ability to pay rent   after the compilation and review of all documentation and other relevant considerations the deal team finalizes its detailed underwriting analysis of the property’s cash flow in accordance with cgmrc’s propertyspecific cash flow

andor mezzanine debt secured by direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower and when such mezzanine or subordinate debt is taken into account may result in aggregate debt that does not conform to the aforementioned debt service coverage ratio and loantovalue ratio parameters   amortization requirements while cgmrc’s underwriting guidelines generally permit a maximum amortization period of  years certain loans may provide for interestonly payments through maturity or for a portion of the loan term if the loan entails only a partial interestonly period the monthly debt service

wells fargo bank’s loan underwriters commence a review of the borrower’s financial condition and creditworthiness and the real property which will secure the loan   notwithstanding the discussion below given the unique nature of incomeproducing real properties the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with respect to any particular multifamily or commercial mortgage loan may differ significantly from one asset to another and will be driven by circumstances particular to that property including among others its type current use physical quality size environmental condition location market conditions capital reserve requirements and additional collateral tenants and leases borrower identity borrower sponsorship andor performance history and certain other factors consequently we cannot assure you that the underwriting of any particular multifamily or commercial mortgage loan will conform to each of the general procedures described in this “—wells fargo bank’s commercial mortgage loan underwriting” section for important information about the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool see the “risk factors” and “description of the mortgage pool—exceptions to underwriting guidelines” sections of this prospectus and the other subsections of this “transaction parties” section   if a mortgage loan exhibits any one of the following credit positive characteristics variances from general underwritingorigination procedures described below may be considered acceptable under the circumstances indicated i low loantovalue ratio ii high debt service coverage ratio iii experienced sponsorsguarantors with financial wherewithal and iv elements of recourse included in the loan   loan analysis generally wells fargo bank performs both a credit analysis and collateral analysis with respect to a loan applicant and the real estate that will secure the loan in general credit analysis of the borrower and the real estate includes a review of historical financial statements or in the case of acquisitions often only current financial statements rent rolls certain leases thirdparty credit reports judgments liens bankruptcy and pending litigation searches and if applicable the loan payment history of the borrower wells fargo bank typically performs a qualitative analysis which incorporates independent credit checks and published debt and equity information with respect to certain principals of the borrower as well as the borrower itself borrowers are generally required to be singlepurpose entities the collateral analysis typically includes an analysis of the following to the extent available and applicable based on property type historical property operating statements rent rolls operating budgets a projection of future performance and a review of certain tenant leases depending on the type of collateral property and other factors the        credit of key tenants may also be reviewed each mortgaged property is generally inspected by a wells fargo bank underwriter or qualified designee wells fargo bank generally requires thirdparty appraisals as well as environmental and property condition reports and if determined by wells fargo bank to be applicable seismic reports each report is reviewed for acceptability by a staff member of wells fargo bank or a thirdparty consultant generally the results of these reviews are incorporated into the underwriting report in some instances one or more of the procedures may be waived or modified by wells fargo bank if it is determined not to adversely affect the mortgage loans originated by it in any material respect   loan approval prior to loan closing all mortgage loans to be originated by wells fargo bank must be approved by one or more officers of wells fargo bank depending on loan size who may approve a mortgage loan as recommended request additional due diligence modify the loan terms or decline a loan transaction   debt service coverage ratios and loantovalue ratios generally the debt service coverage ratios for wells fargo bank mortgage loans will be equal to or greater than x provided however that variances may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the mortgage loan the related mortgaged property loantovalue ratio reserves or other factors for example wells fargo bank may originate a mortgage loan with a debt service coverage ratio below x based on among other things the amortization features of the mortgage loan for example if the mortgage loan provides for relatively rapid amortization the type of tenants and leases at the mortgaged property the taking of additional collateral such as reserves letters of credit andor guarantees wells fargo bank’s judgment of improved property andor market performance in the future andor other relevant factors   generally the loantovalue ratio for wells fargo bank mortgage loans will be equal to or less than  provided however that variances may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the mortgage loan the related mortgaged property debt service coverage reserves or other factors for example wells fargo bank may originate a mortgage loan with a loantovalue ratio above  based on among other things the amortization features of the mortgage loan for example if the mortgage loan provides for relatively rapid amortization the type of tenants and leases at the related mortgaged property the taking of additional collateral such as reserves letters of credit andor guarantees wells fargo bank’s judgment of improved property andor performance in the future andor other relevant factors   while the foregoing discussion generally reflects how calculations of debt service coverage ratios are made it does not necessarily reflect the specific calculations made to determine the debt service coverage ratio disclosed in this prospectus with respect to the mortgage loans to be sold to us by wells fargo bank for deposit into the trust fund   additional debt when underwriting a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan wells fargo bank will take into account whether the mortgaged property andor direct or indirect interest in a related borrower are encumbered by additional debt and will analyze the likely effect of that additional debt on repayment of the subject mortgage loan it is possible that wells fargo bank or an affiliate will be the lender on that additional debt and may either sell such debt to an unaffiliated third party or hold it in inventory   the combined debt service coverage ratios and loantovalue ratios of a mortgage loan and the related additional debt may be significantly below x and significantly above  notwithstanding that the mortgage loan by itself may satisfy such guidelines        assessments of property condition as part of the underwriting process wells fargo bank will analyze the condition of the real property collateral for a prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan to aid in that analysis wells fargo bank will typically inspect or retain a third party to inspect the property and will in most cases obtain the property assessments and reports described below   appraisals wells fargo bank will in most cases require that the real property collateral for a prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan be appraised by a statecertified appraiser an appraiser belonging to the “appraisal institute” a membership association of professional real estate appraisers or an otherwise qualified appraiser in addition wells fargo bank will generally require that those appraisals be conducted in accordance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practices developed by the appraisal foundation a notforprofit organization established by the appraisal profession furthermore the appraisal report will usually include or be accompanied by a separate letter that includes a statement by the appraiser that the guidelines in title xi of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  were followed in preparing the appraisal in some cases however wells fargo bank may establish the value of the subject real property collateral based on a cash flow analysis a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation   environmental assessments wells fargo bank will in most cases require a phase i environmental assessment with respect to the real property collateral for a prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan however when circumstances warrant wells fargo bank may utilize an update of a prior environmental assessment a transaction screen or a desktop review alternatively wells fargo bank might forego an environmental assessment in limited circumstances such as when it has obtained the benefits of an environmental insurance policy or an environmental guarantee furthermore an environmental assessment conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily cover all potential environmental issues for example an analysis for radon leadbased paint and lead in drinking water will usually be conducted only at multifamily rental properties and only when wells fargo bank or the environmental consultant believes that special circumstances warrant such an analysis   depending on the findings of the initial environmental assessment wells fargo bank may require additional record searches or environmental testing such as a phase ii environmental assessment with respect to the real property collateral   engineering assessments in connection with the origination process wells fargo bank may require that an engineering firm inspect the real property collateral for any prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan to assess the structure exterior walls roofing interior structure andor mechanical and electrical systems based on the resulting report wells fargo bank will determine the appropriate response if any to any recommended repairs corrections or replacements and any identified deferred maintenance   seismic report in general prospective borrowers seeking loans secured by properties located in california or in seismic zones  or  obtain a seismic engineering report of the building and based thereon and on certain statistical information an estimate of damage based on the percentage of the replacement cost of the building in an earthquake scenario this percentage of the replacement cost is expressed in terms of probable maximum loss “pml” probable loss “pl” or scenario expected loss “sel” generally any of the mortgage loans as to which the property was estimated to have pml pl or sel in excess of  of the estimated replacement cost would either be subject to a lower loantovalue ratio limit at origination be conditioned on seismic upgrading or appropriate reserves or        letter of credit for retrofitting be conditioned on satisfactory earthquake insurance or be structured with a degree of recourse to a guarantor   zoning and building code compliance in connection with the origination of a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan wells fargo bank will generally consider whether the use and occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning landuse building rules regulations and orders then applicable to that property evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the following legal opinions surveys recorded documents temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy letters from government officials or agencies including applicable land use and zoning regulations title insurance endorsements engineering or consulting reports andor representations by the related borrower   where a mortgaged property as currently operated is a permitted nonconforming use andor the structure and the improvements may not be rebuilt to the same dimensions or used in the same manner in the event of a major casualty wells fargo bank will consider whether—   ·     any major casualty that would prevent rebuilding has a sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring   ·     casualty insurance proceeds together with the value of any additional collateral would be available in an amount estimated by wells fargo bank to be sufficient to pay off the related mortgage loan in full   ·     the real property collateral if permitted to be repaired or restored in conformity with current law would in wells fargo bank’s judgment constitute adequate security for the related mortgage loan   ·     whether a variance or other similar change in applicable zoning restrictions is potentially available or whether the applicable governing entity is likely to enforce the related limitations andor   ·     to require the related borrower to obtain law and ordinance insurance andor alternative mitigant is in place   escrow requirements generally wells fargo bank requires most borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes and insurance capital expenses and replacement reserves generally the required escrows for mortgage loans originated by wells fargo bank are as follows   ·     taxes—typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to th of the annual property taxes based on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate are required to provide wells fargo bank with sufficient funds to satisfy all taxes and assessments tax escrows may not be required if a property is a single tenant property and the tenant is required to pay taxes directly wells fargo bank may waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances   ·     insurance—if the property is insured under an individual policy ie the property is not covered by a blanket policy typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to th of the annual property insurance premium are required to provide wells fargo bank with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums insurance escrows may not be required if i the borrower maintains a blanket insurance policy or ii the property is a single tenant property which may include        ground leased tenants and the tenant is required to maintain property insurance wells fargo bank may waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances    ·     replacement reserves—replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent thirdparty property condition or engineering report or to certain minimum requirements by property type replacement reserves may not be required if the related mortgaged property is a single tenant property and the related tenant is responsible for all repairs and maintenance including those required with respect to the roof and improvement structure wells fargo bank may waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances   ·     completion repairenvironmental remediation—typically a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where an environmental or engineering report suggests that such reserve is necessary upon funding of the related mortgage loan wells fargo bank generally requires that at least  of the estimated costs of repairs or replacements be reserved and generally requires that repairs or replacements be completed within a year after the funding of the related mortgage loan wells fargo bank may waive this escrow requirement or adjust the timing to complete repairs under certain circumstances   ·     tenant improvementlease commissions—in most cases various tenants have lease expirations within the mortgage loan term to mitigate this risk special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan andor during the related mortgage loan term to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with releasing the space occupied by such tenants tenant improvementlease commissions may not be required for single tenant properties with leases that extend beyond the loan term or where rent at the mortgaged property is considered below market wells fargo bank may waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances   furthermore wells fargo bank may accept an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being addressed in some cases wells fargo bank may determine that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted in the event of the existence of one or more of the credit positive characteristics discussed above or given the amounts that would be involved and wells fargo bank’s evaluation of the ability of the mortgaged property the borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the subject expense or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve   cooriginations from time to time wells fargo bank originates mortgage loans together with other financial institutions the resulting mortgage loans are evidenced by two or more promissory notes at least one of which will reflect wells fargo bank as the payee wells fargo bank has in the past and may in the future deposit such promissory notes for which it is named as payee with one or more securitization trusts while its cooriginators have in the past and may in the future deposit such promissory notes for which they are named payee into other securitization trusts no wells fargo bank mortgage loan to be included in the trust fund has been cooriginated as described in this paragraph        exceptions one or more of wells fargo bank’s mortgage loans may vary from the specific wells fargo bank’s underwriting guidelines described above when additional credit positive characteristics are present as discussed above in addition in the case of one or more of wells fargo bank’s mortgage loans wells fargo bank or another originator may not have applied each of the specific underwriting guidelines described above as the result of casebycase permitted

include all late payments of principal made by a borrower with respect to the mortgage loans including late payments in respect of a delinquent balloon payment received by the times described above in this definition except to the extent those late payments are otherwise available to reimburse the master servicer or the trustee as the case may be for prior advances as described above   the “unscheduled principal distribution amount” for each distribution date will equal the aggregate of the following a all prepayments of principal received on the mortgage loans as of the determination date and b any other collections exclusive of payments by borrowers received on the mortgage loans and any reo properties on or prior to the related determination date whether in the form of liquidation proceeds insurance and condemnation proceeds net income rents and profits from reo property or otherwise that were identified and applied by the master servicer as recoveries of previously unadvanced principal of the related mortgage loan provided that all such liquidation proceeds and insurance and condemnation proceeds will be reduced by any unpaid special servicing fees liquidation fees any amount related to the loss of value payments to the extent that such amount was transferred into the collection account during the related collection period accrued interest on advances and other additional trust fund expenses incurred in connection with the related mortgage loan thus reducing the unscheduled principal distribution amount   the “assumed scheduled payment” for any collection period and with respect to any mortgage loan including any nonserviced mortgage loan that is delinquent in respect of its balloon payment or any reo loan excluding for purposes of any pi advances the portion allocable to any related companion loan is an amount equal to the sum of a the principal portion of the periodic payment that would have been due on such mortgage loan         or reo loan on the related due date based on the constant payment required by such related mortgage note or the original amortization schedule of the mortgage loan as the case may be as calculated with interest at the related mortgage rate if applicable assuming the related balloon payment has not become due after giving effect to any reduction in the principal balance occurring in connection with a modification of such mortgage loan in connection with a default or a bankruptcy or similar proceeding and b interest on the stated principal balance of that mortgage loan or reo loan excluding for purposes of any pi advances the portion allocable to any related companion loan at its mortgage rate net of interest at the applicable rate at which the servicing fee is calculated   the “principal shortfall” for any distribution date means the amount if any by which  the principal distribution amount for the prior distribution date exceeds  the aggregate amount actually distributed on the preceding distribution date in respect of such principal distribution amount   the “class asb planned principal balance” for any distribution date is the balance shown for such distribution date in the table set forth in annex e to this prospectus such balances were calculated using among other things certain weighted average life assumptions see “yield and maturity considerations—weighted average life” based on such assumptions the certificate balance of the class asb certificates on each distribution date would be expected to be reduced to the balance indicated for such distribution date in the table set forth in annex e to this prospectus we cannot assure you however that the mortgage loans will perform in conformity with our assumptions therefore we cannot assure you that the balance of the class asb certificates on any distribution date will be equal to the balance that is specified for such distribution date in the table   certain calculations with respect to individual mortgage loans   the “stated principal balance” of each mortgage loan will be an amount equal to its unpaid principal balance as of the cutoff date or in the case of a replacement mortgage loan as of the date it is added to the trust after application of all payments of principal due during or prior to the month of substitution whether or not those payments have been received minus the sum of                          i    the principal portion of each periodic payment due on such mortgage loan after the cutoff date or in the case of a replacement mortgage loan due after the due date in the

of all insurance and condemnation proceeds to the extent allocable to principal on the related mortgage loan liquidation proceeds and all income rents and profits received with respect to such reo loan   see “certain legal aspects of mortgage loans” below   with respect to each companion loan on any date of determination the stated principal balance will equal the unpaid principal balance of such companion loan as of such date on any date of determination the stated principal balance of each whole loan will equal the sum of the stated principal balances of the related mortgage loan and

of principal balance certificates a fraction a the numerator of which is the greater of x zero and y the difference between i the passthrough rate on that class and ii the applicable discount rate and

the base interest fraction be greater than one   ·if the discount rate referred to above is greater than or equal to the mortgage interest rate on the related mortgage loan and is greater than or equal to the passthrough rate on that class then the base interest fraction will equal zero and   ·if the discount rate referred to above is greater than or equal to the mortgage interest rate on the related mortgage loan and is less than the passthrough rate on that class then the base interest fraction will be equal to    “discount rate” means with respect to any principal prepayment of any mortgage loan that provides for the payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium—   ·if a discount rate was used in the calculation of the applicable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan or reo loan that discount rate converted if necessary to a monthly equivalent yield or   ·if a discount rate was not used in the calculation of the applicable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan the yield calculated by the linear interpolation of the yields as reported in federal reserve statistical release h —selected interest rates under the heading “us government securitiestreasury constant maturities” for the week ending prior to the date of the relevant prepayment or deemed prepayment of us treasury constant maturities with a maturity date one longer and one shorter most nearly approximating the maturity date of that mortgage loan or reo loan such interpolated treasury yield converted to a monthly equivalent yield   for purposes of the immediately preceding bullet the certificate administrator or the master servicer will select a comparable publication as the source of the applicable yields of         us treasury constant maturities if federal reserve statistical release h is no longer published   “prepayment premium” means with respect to any mortgage loan any premium fee or other additional amount other than a yield maintenance charge paid or payable as the context requires by a borrower in connection with a principal prepayment on or other early collection of principal of that mortgage loan or any successor reo loan with respect thereto including any payoff of a mortgage loan by a mezzanine lender on behalf of the subject borrower if and as set forth in the related intercreditor agreement   “yield maintenance charge” means with respect to any mortgage loan any premium fee or other additional amount paid or payable as the context requires by a borrower in connection with a principal prepayment on or other early collection of principal of a mortgage loan calculated in whole or in part pursuant to a yield maintenance formula or otherwise pursuant to a formula that reflects the lost interest including any specified amount or specified percentage of the amount prepaid which constitutes the minimum amount that such yield maintenance

assumed final distribution date rated final distribution date   the “assumed final distribution date” with respect to any class of certificates is the distribution date on which the aggregate certificate balance or notional amount of that class of certificates would be reduced to zero based on the assumptions set forth below the assumed final distribution date with respect to each class of offered certificates will in each case be as follows    class  assumed final distribution date  class a october  class aa december  class ab december  class a november  class a december  class asb august  class as december  class xa nap class xb nap class b december  class c december    the assumed final distribution dates set forth above were calculated without regard to any delays in the collection of balloon payments and without regard to delinquencies defaults or liquidations accordingly in the event of defaults on the mortgage loans the actual final distribution date for one or more classes of the offered certificates may be later and could be substantially later than the related assumed final distribution dates   in addition the assumed final distribution dates set forth above were calculated on the basis of a  cpr prepayment rate and the structuring assumptions since the rate of         payment including prepayments of the mortgage loans may exceed the scheduled rate of payments and could exceed the scheduled rate by a substantial amount the actual final distribution date for one or more classes of the offered certificates may be earlier and could be substantially earlier than the related assumed final distribution dates the rate of payments including prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend on the characteristics of the mortgage loans as well as on the prevailing level of interest rates and other economic factors and we cannot assure you as to actual payment experience   the “rated final distribution date” for each class of offered certificates will be the distribution date in december  see “ratings”   prepayment interest shortfalls   if a borrower prepays a mortgage loan other than a nonserviced mortgage loan or serviced whole loan in whole or in part after the due date but on or before the determination date in any calendar month the amount of interest net of related servicing fees and any excess interest accrued on such prepayment from such due date to but not including the date of prepayment or any later date through which interest accrues will to the extent actually collected without regard to any prepayment premium or yield maintenance charge actually collected constitute a “prepayment interest excess” conversely if a borrower prepays a mortgage loan other than a nonserviced mortgage loan or serviced whole loan in whole or in part after the determination date or with respect to each mortgage loan other than a nonserviced mortgage loan or serviced pari passu companion loan as applicable with a due date occurring after the related determination date the related due date in any calendar month and does not pay interest on such prepayment through the following due date then the shortfall in a full month’s interest net of related servicing fees and any excess interest on such prepayment will constitute a “prepayment interest shortfall” prepayment interest excesses to the extent not offset by prepayment interest shortfalls or required to be paid as compensating interest payments collected on the mortgage loans other than any nonserviced mortgage loan and any related serviced pari passu companion loan will be retained by the master servicer as additional servicing compensation   the master servicer will be required to deliver to the certificate administrator for deposit in the distribution account other than the portion of any compensating interest payment described below that is allocable to a serviced pari passu companion loan on each master servicer remittance date without any right of reimbursement thereafter a cash payment a “compensating interest payment” in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of                          i    the aggregate amount of prepayment interest shortfalls incurred in connection with voluntary principal prepayments received in respect of the mortgage loans other than each nonserviced mortgage loan and any related serviced pari passu companion loan in each case other than a specially serviced loan or a mortgage loan or any related serviced pari passu companion loan on which the special servicer allowed a prepayment on a date other than the applicable due date for the related distribution date and                         ii    the aggregate of a that portion of the master servicer’s servicing fees for the related distribution date that is in the case of each mortgage loan other than a nonserviced mortgage loan serviced pari passu companion loan and reo loan for which such servicing fees are being paid in such collection period calculated at a rate of  per annum b all prepayment interest excesses received by the master servicer during such collection period with respect to the mortgage loans other than the nonserviced mortgage loans and so long as a whole loan is          serviced under the psa any related serviced pari passu companion loan subject to such prepayment and c to the extent earned on voluntary principal prepayments net investment earnings payable to the master servicer for such collection period received by the master servicer during such collection period with respect to the mortgage loans other than the nonserviced mortgage loans or any related serviced pari passu companion loan as applicable subject to such prepayment in no event will the rights of the certificateholders to the offset of the aggregate prepayment interest shortfalls be cumulative   if a prepayment interest shortfall occurs with respect to a mortgage loan as a result of the master servicer allowing the related borrower to deviate a “prohibited prepayment” from the terms of the related mortgage loan documents regarding principal prepayments other than v any nonserviced mortgage loan w subsequent to a default under the related mortgage loan documents or if the mortgage loan is a specially serviced loan x pursuant to applicable law or a court order or otherwise in such circumstances where the master servicer is required to accept such principal prepayment in accordance with the servicing standard y at the request or with the consent of the special servicer or so long as no control termination event has occurred or is continuing and with respect to the mortgage loans other than an excluded loan the directing certificateholder or z in connection with the payment of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards then for purposes of calculating the compensating interest payment for the related distribution date the master servicer will pay without regard to clause ii above the aggregate amount of prepayment interest shortfalls with respect to such mortgage loan otherwise described in clause i above in connection with such prohibited prepayments   compensating interest payments with respect to any serviced whole loan will be allocated among the related mortgage loan and the related serviced pari passu companion loan in accordance with their respective principal amounts and the master servicer will be required to pay the portion of such compensating interest payments allocable to the related serviced pari passu companion loan to the related other master servicer   the aggregate of any prepayment interest shortfalls resulting from any principal prepayments made on the mortgage loans to be included in the available funds for any distribution date that are not covered by the master servicer’s compensating interest payment for the related distribution date and the portion of the compensating interest payments allocable to each nonserviced mortgage loan to the extent received from the related nonserviced master servicer such amounts the “excess prepayment interest shortfall” will be allocated on that distribution date among each class of regular certificates pro rata in accordance with their respective interest accrual amounts for that distribution date   subordination allocation of realized losses   the rights of holders of the subordinate certificates to receive distributions of amounts collected or advanced on the mortgage loans will be subordinated to the extent described in this prospectus to the rights of holders of the senior certificates in particular the rights of the holders of the class as class b class c class d class e class f and class g certificates to receive distributions of interest and principal as applicable will be subordinated to such rights of the holders of the senior certificates the class as certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination of the class b class c class d class e class f and class g certificates the class b certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination of the class c class d class e class f and class g certificates the class c certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination of the class d class e         class f and class g certificates the class d certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination of the class e class f and class g certificates   this subordination will be effected in two ways i by the preferential right of the holders of a class of certificates to receive on any distribution date the amounts of interest andor principal distributable to them prior to any distribution being made on such distribution date in respect of any classes of certificates subordinate to that class as described above under “—distributions—priority of distributions” and ii by the allocation of realized losses to classes of certificates that are subordinate to more senior classes as described below   no other form of credit support will be available for the benefit of the offered certificates   prior to the crossover date allocation of principal on any distribution date will be made first to the class asb certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to the class asb planned principal balance for the related distribution date second to the class a certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to zero third to the class aa certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to zero fourth to the class ab certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to zero fifth to the class a certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to zero sixth to the class a certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to zero and seventh to the class asb certificates until their certificate balance has been reduced to zero on or after the crossover date allocation of principal will be made to the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates that are still outstanding pro rata without regard to the class asb planned principal balance until their certificate balances have been reduced to zero see “—distributions—priority of distributions” above   allocation to the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates for so long as they are outstanding of the entire principal distribution amount for each distribution date will have the effect of reducing the aggregate certificate balance of the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates at a proportionately faster rate than the rate at which the aggregate stated principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans will decline therefore as principal is distributed to the holders of the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates the percentage interest in the issuing entity evidenced by the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates will be decreased with a corresponding increase in the percentage interest in the issuing entity evidenced by the subordinate certificates thereby increasing relative to their respective certificate balances the subordination afforded to the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates by the subordinate certificates   following retirement of the class a class aa class ab class a class a and class asb certificates the successive allocation on each distribution date of the remaining principal distribution amount to the class as certificates the class b certificates the class c certificates the class d certificates the class e certificates the class f certificates and class g certificates in that order for so long as they are outstanding will provide a similar but diminishing benefit to those certificates other than to class g certificates as to the relative amount of subordination afforded by the outstanding classes of certificates with later sequential designations   on each distribution date immediately following the distributions to be made to the certificateholders on that date the certificate administrator is required to calculate the         amount if any by which i the aggregate stated principal balance for purposes of this calculation only the aggregate stated principal balance will not be reduced by the amount of principal payments received on the mortgage loans that were used to reimburse the master servicer the special servicer or the trustee from general collections of principal on the mortgage loans for workoutdelayed reimbursement amounts to the extent those amounts are not otherwise determined to be nonrecoverable advances of the mortgage loans including any reo loans but in each case excluding any companion loan expected to be outstanding immediately following that distribution date is less than ii the then aggregate certificate balance of the principal balance certificates after giving effect to distributions of principal on that distribution date any such deficit a “realized loss” the certificate administrator will be required to allocate any realized losses among the respective classes of principal balance certificates in the following order until the certificate balance of each such class is reduced to zero   first to the class g certificates   second to the class f certificates   third to the class e certificates   fourth to the class d certificates   fifth to the class c certificates   sixth to the class b certificates and   seventh to the class as certificates   following the reduction of the certificate balances of all classes of subordinate certificates to zero the certificate administrator will be required to allocate realized losses among the senior certificates other than the class x certificates pro rata based upon their respective certificate balances until their respective certificate balances have been reduced to zero   realized losses will not be allocated to the class v certificates or the class r certificates and will not be directly allocated to the class x certificates however the notional amounts of the classes of class x certificates will be reduced if the related classes of principal balance certificates are reduced by such realized losses   in general realized losses could result from the occurrence of  losses and other shortfalls on or in respect of the mortgage loans including as a result of defaults and delinquencies on the related mortgage loans nonrecoverable advances made in respect of the mortgage loans the payment to the special servicer of any compensation as described in “pooling and servicing agreement—servicing and other compensation and payment of expenses” and the payment of interest on advances and certain servicing expenses and  certain unanticipated nonmortgage loan specific expenses of the issuing entity including certain reimbursements to the certificate administrator or trustee as described under “transaction parties—the trustee” or “—the certificate administrator” and certain federal state and local taxes and certain taxrelated expenses payable out of the issuing entity as described under “material federal income tax considerations”   a class of regular certificates will be considered outstanding until its certificate balance or notional amount as the case may be is reduced to zero however notwithstanding a reduction of its certificate balance to zero reimbursements of any previously allocated realized losses are required thereafter to be made to a class of principal balance         certificates in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in “—distributions—priority of distributions” above   reports to certificateholders certain available information   certificate administrator reports   on each distribution date the certificate administrator will be required to prepare and make available to each certificateholder of record a distribution date statement providing the information required under regulation ab and in the form of annex b relating to distributions made on that date for the relevant class and the recent status of the mortgage loans   in addition the certificate administrator will include to the extent it receives such information i the identity of any mortgage loans permitting additional debt identifying a the amount of any additional debt incurred during the related collection period b the total dscr calculated on the basis of the mortgage loan and such additional debt and c the aggregate loantovalue

certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or to otherwise act with respect to such offered certificates may be limited due to the lack of a physical certificate for such offered certificates   dtc has advised the depositor that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of an offered certificate under the psa only at the direction of one or more

appraisal any recalculation of the applicable appraisal reduction amount is warranted and if so warranted will recalculate such appraisal reduction amount based upon such supplemental appraisal and receipt of information requested by the special servicer from the master servicer as described above if required by any such recalculation the applicable appraisedout class will be reinstated as the controlling class and each other appraisedout class will if applicable have its related certificate balance notionally restored to the extent required by such recalculation of the appraisal reduction amount   any appraisedout class for which the requesting holders are challenging the special servicer’s appraisal reduction amount determination may not exercise any direction control consent andor similar rights of the controlling class until such time if any as such class is reinstated as the controlling class the rights of the controlling class will be exercised by the most senior class of

the special servicer on behalf of the trustee may in accordance with the terms and provisions of the psa at any time institute foreclosure proceedings exercise any power of sale contained in the related mortgage obtain a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise acquire title to the related mortgaged property by operation of law or otherwise the special servicer is not permitted however to cause the trustee to acquire title to any mortgaged property have a        receiver of rents appointed with respect to any mortgaged property or take any other action with respect to any mortgaged property that would cause the trustee for the benefit of the certificateholders or any other specified person to be considered to hold title to to be a “mortgageeinpossession” of or to be an “owner” or an “operator” of such mortgaged property within the meaning of certain federal environmental laws unless the special servicer has determined in accordance with the servicing standard based on an updated environmental assessment report prepared by a person who regularly conducts environmental audits and performed within six months prior to any such acquisition of title or other action which report will be an expense of the issuing entity subject to the terms of the psa that   a such mortgaged property is in compliance with applicable environmental laws or if not after consultation with an environmental consultant that it would be in the best economic interest of the certificateholders and with respect to any serviced whole loan the related companion holders as a collective whole as if such certificateholders and if applicable companion holders constituted a single lender to take such actions as are necessary to bring such mortgaged property in compliance with such laws and   b there are no circumstances present at such mortgaged property relating to the use management or disposal of any hazardous materials for which investigation testing monitoring containment cleanup or remediation could be required under any currently effective federal state or local law or regulation or that if any such hazardous materials are present for which such action could be required after consultation with an environmental consultant it would be in the best economic interest of the certificateholders and with respect to any serviced whole loan the related companion holders as a collective whole as if such certificateholders and if applicable companion holders constituted a single lender to take such actions with respect to the affected mortgaged property   such requirement precludes enforcement of the security for the related mortgage loan until a satisfactory environmental site assessment is obtained or until any required remedial action is taken but will decrease the likelihood that the issuing entity will become liable for a material adverse environmental condition at the mortgaged property however we cannot assure you that the requirements of the psa will effectively insulate the issuing entity from potential liability for a materially adverse environmental condition at any mortgaged property   if title to any mortgaged property is acquired by the issuing entity directly or through a single member limited liability company established for that purpose the special servicer will be required to sell the mortgaged property prior to the close of the third calendar year beginning after the year of acquisition unless  the irs grants or does not deny a qualifying extension of time to sell the mortgaged property or  the special servicer the certificate administrator and the trustee receive an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the holding of the mortgaged property by the lowertier remic longer than the abovereferenced  year period will not result in the imposition of a tax on any trust remic or cause any trust remic to fail to qualify as a remic under the code at any time that any certificate is outstanding subject to the foregoing and any other taxrelated limitations pursuant to the psa the special servicer will generally be required to attempt to sell any mortgaged property so acquired in accordance with the servicing standard the special servicer will also be required to ensure that any mortgaged property acquired by the issuing entity is administered so that it constitutes “foreclosure property” within the meaning of code section ga at all times and that the sale of the mortgaged property does not result in the receipt by the issuing entity of any income from nonpermitted assets as described in code section fab if any lowertier remic acquires title to any        mortgaged property the special servicer on behalf of such lowertier remic will retain at the expense of the issuing entity an independent contractor to manage and operate the property the independent contractor generally will be permitted to perform construction including renovation on a foreclosed property only if the construction was more than  completed at the time default on the related mortgage loan became imminent the retention of an independent contractor however will not relieve the special servicer of its obligation to manage the mortgaged property as required under the psa   in general the special servicer will be obligated to cause any mortgaged property acquired as an reo property to be operated and managed in a manner that would in its good faith and reasonable judgment and to the extent commercially feasible maximize the issuing entity’s net aftertax proceeds from such property generally no trust remic will be taxable on income received with respect to a mortgaged property acquired by the issuing entity to the extent that it constitutes “rents from real property” within the meaning of code section ca and treasury regulations under the code rents from real property include fixed rents and rents based on the gross receipts or sales of a tenant but do not include the portion of any rental based on the net income or profit of any tenant or subtenant no determination has been made whether rent on any of the mortgaged properties meets this requirement rents from real property include charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property whether or not the charges are separately stated services furnished to the tenants of a particular building will be considered as customary if in the geographic market in which the building is located tenants in buildings which are of similar class are customarily provided with the service no determination has been made whether the services furnished to the tenants of the mortgaged properties are “customary” within the meaning of applicable regulations it is therefore possible that a portion of the rental income with respect to a mortgaged property owned by the issuing entity would not constitute rents from real property in addition it is possible that none of the income with respect to a mortgaged property would qualify if a separate charge is not stated for noncustomary services provided to tenants or if such services are not performed by an independent contractor rents from real property also do not include income from the operation of a trade or business on the mortgaged property such as a hotel property or rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property if the rent attributable to personal property exceeds  of the total net rent for the taxable year any of the foregoing types of income may instead constitute “net income from foreclosure property” which would be taxable to a remic at the highest marginal federal corporate rate currently  and may also be subject to state or local taxes the psa provides that the special servicer will be permitted to cause the lowertier remic to earn “net income from foreclosure property” that is subject to tax if it determines that the net aftertax benefit to certificateholders is greater than another method of operating or net leasing the mortgaged property because these sources of income if they exist are already in place with respect to the mortgaged properties it is generally viewed as beneficial to certificateholders to permit the issuing entity to continue to earn them if it acquires a mortgaged property even at the cost of this tax these taxes would be chargeable against the related income for purposes of determining the proceeds available for distribution to holders of certificates see “material federal income tax considerations—taxes that may be imposed on a remic—prohibited transactions”   under the psa the special servicer is required to establish and maintain one or more reo accounts to be held on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the certificateholders and with respect to a serviced whole loan the related companion holder for the retention of revenues and insurance proceeds derived from each reo property the special servicer is required to use the funds in the reo account to pay for the proper operation management        maintenance and disposition of any reo property but only to the extent that amounts on deposit in the reo account relate to such reo property to the extent that amounts in the reo account in respect of any reo property are insufficient to make such payments the master servicer is required to make a servicing advance unless it determines such servicing advance would be nonrecoverable on or prior to each determination date the special servicer is required to deposit all amounts received in respect of each reo property during the most recently ended collection period net of any amounts withdrawn to make any permitted disbursements into the collection account provided that the special servicer may retain in the reo account permitted reserves   sale of defaulted loans and reo properties   if the special servicer determines in accordance with the servicing standard that no satisfactory arrangements including by way of discounted payoff can be made for collection of delinquent payments thereon and such sale would be in the best economic interests of the certificateholders or in the case of a serviced whole loan certificateholders and any holder of the related serviced pari passu companion loan as a collective whole as if such certificateholders and companion holder constituted a single lender to attempt to sell a defaulted loan other than a nonserviced mortgage loan and any related serviced pari passu companion loan as described below the special servicer will be required to use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for each defaulted loan on behalf of the certificateholders and the holder of any related serviced pari passu companion loan in such manner as will be reasonably likely to maximize the value of the defaulted loan on a net present value basis in the case of each nonserviced mortgage loan under certain limited circumstances permitted under the related intercreditor agreement to the extent that such nonserviced mortgage loan is not sold together with the related nonserviced companion loan by the special servicer for the related nonserviced whole loans the special servicer will be entitled to sell with respect to any mortgage loan other than an excluded loan with the consent of the directing certificateholder if no control termination event has occurred and is continuing such nonserviced mortgage loan if it determines in accordance with the servicing standard that such action would be in the best interests of the certificateholders in the absence of a cash offer at least equal to its outstanding principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest and outstanding costs and expenses and certain other amounts under the psa a “par purchase price” the special servicer may purchase the defaulted loan for the par purchase price or may accept the first cash offer received from any person that constitutes a fair price for the defaulted loan if multiple offers are received during the period designated by the special servicer for receipt of offers the special servicer is generally required to select the highest offer the special servicer is required to give the trustee the certificate administrator the master servicer the operating advisor and other than in respect of any

payments or delinquent in respect of its balloon payment if any provided that in respect of a balloon payment such period will be  days if the related borrower has provided the special servicer with a written and fully executed commitment for refinancing of the related mortgage loan from an acceptable lender reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the special servicer and in either case

determining whether any offer from a person other than an interested person constitutes a fair price for any defaulted loan the special servicer will be required to take into account in addition to the results of any appraisal updated appraisal or narrative appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to the psa within the prior  months among other factors the period and amount of the occupancy level and physical condition of the related mortgaged property and the state of the local economy   if the offeror is an interested person provided that the trustee may not be a offeror then the trustee will be required to determine whether the cash offer constitutes a fair price unless i the offer is equal to or greater than the applicable par purchase price and ii the offer is the highest offer received absent an offer at least equal to the par purchase price no offer from an interested person will constitute a fair price unless a it is the highest offer received and b at least two other offers are received from independent third parties in determining whether any offer received from an interested person represents a fair price for any such defaulted loan the trustee will be supplied with and will be required to rely on the most recent appraisal or updated appraisal conducted in accordance with the psa within the preceding month period or in the absence of any such appraisal on a new appraisal except as provided in the following paragraph the cost of any appraisal will be covered by and will be reimbursable as a servicing advance by the master servicer   notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary if the trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an interested person constitutes a fair price the trustee may at its option and at the expense of the interested person designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least  years’ experience in valuing loans similar to the subject mortgage loan or serviced whole loan as the case may be that has been selected with reasonable care by the trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such mortgage loan or serviced whole loan if the trustee designates such a third party to make such determination the trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party’s determination the reasonable fees of and the costs of all appraisals inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph will be covered by and will be reimbursable by the interested person provided that the trustee will not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the trustee   the special servicer is required to use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for each reo property on behalf of the certificateholders and the related companion holders if applicable and to sell each reo property in the same manner as with respect to a defaulted loan   notwithstanding any of the foregoing paragraphs the special servicer will not be required to accept the highest cash offer for a defaulted loan or reo property if the special servicer determines with respect to any mortgage loan other than an excluded loan in consultation with the directing certificateholder unless a

standard and subject to the requirements of any related intercreditor agreement that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the certificateholders and in the case of a sale of a serviced whole loan or an reo property related to a serviced whole loan the related companion holders as a collective whole as if such certificateholders and if applicable the related companion holders constituted a single lender in addition the special servicer may accept a lower offer from any person other than itself or an affiliate if it        determines in its reasonable and good faith

delivered by the master servicer for such distribution date the certificate administrator will be required to determine if an asset review trigger has occurred if an asset review trigger is determined to have occurred the certificate administrator will be required to promptly provide notice to all certificateholders by posting a notice of its determination on its internet website and by mailing such notice to the certificateholders’ addresses appearing in the certificate register on each distribution date after providing such notice to the certificateholders the certificate administrator based on information provided to it by the master servicer or the special servicer will be required to determine whether  any additional mortgage loan has become a delinquent loan  any mortgage loan has ceased to be a delinquent loan and  an asset review trigger has ceased to exist and if there is an occurrence of any of the events or circumstances identified in clauses   andor  deliver such information in a written notice which may be via email within  business days to the master servicer the special servicer the operating advisor and the asset representations reviewer an “asset review trigger” will occur when either  mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of  or more of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all of the mortgage loans including any reo loans or a portion of any reo loan in the case of a whole loan held by the issuing entity as of the end of the applicable collection period are delinquent loans or  at least  mortgage loans are delinquent loans as of the end of the applicable collection period and the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans in the aggregate constitutes at least  of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all of the mortgage loans including any reo loans or a portion of any reo loan in the case of a whole loan held by the issuing entity as of the end of the applicable collection period the psa will require that the certificate administrator include in the distribution report on form d relating to the distribution period in which the asset review trigger occurred a description of the events that caused the asset review trigger to occur   we believe this asset review trigger is appropriate considering the unique characteristics of pools of mortgage loans underlying cmbs see “risk factors—risks relating to the mortgage loans—static pool data would not be indicative of the performance of this pool” in general upon a delinquent loan becoming a specially serviced loan as part of the special servicer’s initial investigation into the circumstances that caused the mortgage loan to become delinquent and be transferred to the special servicer the special servicer will typically conduct a review of the delinquent loan for possible breaches of representations and warranties given that the special servicer will commonly have already conducted such a review and discussed any findings with the directing certificateholder prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control termination event prior to the occurrence of an asset review trigger to avoid additional fees costs and expenses to the issuing entity we set the delinquent loan percentage based on an        outstanding principal balance in clause  of the definition of asset review trigger to exceed a delinquency rate that would result in estimated losses that exceed the subordination provided by the control eligible certificates for purpose of this calculation we assumed an average loss severity of  however we cannot assure you that any actual loss severity will equal that assumed percentage on the other hand a significant number of delinquent loans by loan count but representing a smaller percentage of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans than the percentage set forth in clause  of the definition of asset review trigger could also indicate an issue with the quality of the mortgage pool as a result we believe it would be appropriate to have an alternative test as set forth in clause  of the definition of asset review trigger namely to have the asset review trigger be met if mortgage loans representing  of the mortgage loans by loan count are delinquent loans so long as those mortgage loans represent at least  of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans with respect to the  prior pools of commercial mortgage loans for which wells fargo bank or its predecessors was sponsor in a public offering of cmbs with a securitization closing date on or after january   the highest percentage of mortgage loans based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of delinquent mortgage loans in an individual cmbs transaction that were delinquent at least  days at the end of any reporting period between january   and september   was  however the average of the highest delinquency percentages based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of delinquent mortgage loans in the reviewed transactions was  and the highest percentage of delinquent mortgage loans based upon the number of mortgage loans in the reviewed transactions was  and the average of the highest delinquency percentages based on the number of mortgage loans in the reviewed transactions was    “delinquent loan” means a mortgage loan that is delinquent at least  days in respect of its periodic payments or balloon payment if any in either case such delinquency to be determined without giving effect to any grace period   asset review vote   if certificateholders evidencing not less than  of the voting rights deliver to the certificate administrator within  days after the filing of the form d reporting the occurrence of an asset review trigger a written direction requesting a vote to commence an asset review an “asset review vote election” the certificate administrator will be required to promptly provide written notice of such direction to all certificateholders and to conduct a solicitation of votes of certificateholders to authorize an asset review upon the affirmative vote to authorize an asset review by certificateholders evidencing at least a majority of an asset review quorum within  days of the receipt of the asset review vote election an “affirmative asset review vote” the certificate administrator will be required to promptly provide written notice of such affirmative asset review vote to all parties to the psa the underwriters the mortgage loan sellers the directing certificateholder and the certificateholders in the event an affirmative asset review vote has not occurred within such day period following the receipt of the asset review vote election no certificateholder may request a vote or cast a vote for an asset review and the asset representations reviewer will not be required to review any delinquent loan unless and until a an additional mortgage loan has become a delinquent loan after the expiration of such day period b a new asset review trigger has occurred as a result or an asset review trigger is otherwise in effect c the

following discussion contains general summaries of certain legal aspects of mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily residential properties because such legal aspects are governed by applicable local law which laws may differ substantially the summaries do not purport to be complete to reflect the laws of any particular jurisdiction or to encompass the laws of all jurisdictions in which the security for the mortgage loans is situated   california mortgage loans in california are generally secured by deeds of trust on the related real estate foreclosure of a deed of trust in california may be accomplished by a nonjudicial trustee’s sale so long as it is permitted under a specific provision in the deed of trust or by judicial foreclosure in each case subject to and in accordance with the applicable procedures and requirements of california law public notice of either the trustee’s sale or the judgment of foreclosure is given for a statutory period of time after which the mortgaged real estate may be sold by the trustee if foreclosed pursuant to the trustee’s power of sale or by court appointed sheriff under a judicial foreclosure following a judicial foreclosure sale the borrower or its successorininterest may for a period of up to one year redeem the property however there is no redemption following a trustee’s power of sale california’s “security first” and “one action” rules require the lender to complete foreclosure of all real estate provided as security under the deed of trust in a single action in an attempt to satisfy the full debt before bringing a personal action if otherwise permitted against the borrower for recovery of the debt except in certain cases involving environmentally impaired real property where foreclosure of the real property is not required before making a claim under the indemnity this restriction may apply to property which is not located in california if a single promissory note is secured by property located in california and other jurisdictions california case law has held that acts such as but not limited to an offset of an unpledged account constitute violations of such statutes violations of such statutes may result in the loss of some or all of the security under the mortgage loan and a loss of the ability to sue for the debt a sale by the trustee under the deed of trust does not constitute an “action” for purposes of the “one action rule” other statutory provisions in california limit any deficiency judgment if otherwise permitted against the borrower following a judicial foreclosure to the amount by which the indebtedness exceeds the fair value at the time of the public sale and in no event greater than the difference between the foreclosure sale price and the amount of the indebtedness further under california law once a property has been sold pursuant to a power of sale clause contained in a deed of trust and in the case of certain types of purchase money acquisition financings under all circumstances the lender is precluded from seeking a deficiency judgment from the borrower or under certain circumstances guarantors        general   each mortgage loan will be evidenced by a promissory note and secured by an instrument granting a security interest in real property which may be a mortgage deed of trust or a deed to secure debt depending upon the prevailing practice and law in the state in which the related mortgaged property is located mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt are in this prospectus collectively referred to as “mortgages” a mortgage creates a lien upon or grants a title interest in the real property covered thereby and represents the security for the repayment of the indebtedness customarily evidenced by a promissory note the priority of the lien created or interest granted will depend on the terms of the mortgage and in some cases on the terms of separate subordination agreements or intercreditor agreements with others that hold interests in the real property the knowledge of the parties to the mortgage and generally the order of recordation of the mortgage in the appropriate public recording office however the lien of a recorded mortgage will generally be subordinate to laterarising liens for real estate taxes and assessments and other charges imposed under governmental police powers   types of mortgage instruments   there are two parties to a mortgage a mortgagor the borrower and usually the owner of the applicable property and a mortgagee the lender in contrast a deed of trust is a threeparty instrument among a trustor the equivalent of a borrower a trustee to whom the real property is conveyed and a beneficiary the lender for whose benefit the conveyance is made under a deed of trust the trustor grants the property irrevocably until the debt is paid in trust and generally with a power of sale to the trustee to secure repayment of the indebtedness evidenced by the related note a deed to secure debt typically has two parties pursuant to which the borrower or grantor conveys title to the real property to the grantee or lender generally with a power of sale until such time as the debt is repaid in a case where the borrower is a land trust there would be an additional party because legal title to the property is held by a land trustee under a land trust agreement for the benefit of the borrower at origination of a mortgage loan involving a land trust the borrower may execute a separate undertaking to make payments on the promissory note the land trustee would not be personally liable for the promissory note obligation the mortgagee’s authority under a mortgage the trustee’s authority under a deed of trust and the grantee’s authority under a deed to secure debt are governed by the express provisions of the related instrument the law of the state in which the real property is located certain federal laws and in some deed of trust transactions the directions of the beneficiary   leases and rents   mortgages that encumber incomeproducing property often contain an assignment of rents and leases andor may be accompanied by a separate assignment of rents and leases pursuant to which the borrower assigns to the lender the borrower’s right title and interest as landlord under each lease and the income derived from the lease while unless rents are to be paid directly to the lender retaining a revocable license to collect the rents for so long as there is no default if the borrower defaults the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect the rents local law may require that the lender take possession of the property andor obtain a courtappointed receiver before becoming entitled to collect the rents   in most states hotel property and motel room rates are considered accounts receivable under the uniform commercial code “ucc” in cases where hotel properties or motels constitute loan security the revenues are generally pledged by the borrower as additional        security for the loan in general the lender must file financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in the room revenues and must file continuation statements generally every  years to maintain perfection of such security interest in certain cases mortgage loans secured by hotel properties or motels may be included in the issuing entity even if the security interest in the room revenues was not perfected even if the lender’s security interest in room revenues is perfected under applicable nonbankruptcy law it will generally be required to commence a foreclosure action or otherwise take possession of the property in order to enforce its rights to collect the room revenues following a default in the bankruptcy setting however the lender will be stayed from enforcing its rights to collect room revenues but those room revenues constitute “cash collateral” and therefore generally cannot be used by the bankruptcy debtor without a hearing or lender’s consent or unless the lender’s interest in the room revenues is given adequate protection eg cash payment for otherwise encumbered funds or a replacement lien on unencumbered property in either case in value equivalent to the amount of room revenues that the debtor proposes to use or other similar relief see “—bankruptcy laws” below   personalty   in the case of certain types of mortgaged properties such as hotel properties motels nursing homes and manufactured housing personal property to the extent owned by the borrower and not previously pledged may constitute a significant portion of the property’s value as security the creation and enforcement of liens on personal property are governed by the ucc accordingly if a borrower pledges personal property as security for a mortgage loan the lender generally must file ucc financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in that personal property and must file continuation statements generally every five years to maintain that perfection certain mortgage loans secured in part by personal property may be included in the issuing entity even if the security interest in such personal property was not perfected   foreclosure   general   foreclosure is a legal procedure that allows the lender to recover its mortgage debt by enforcing its rights and available legal remedies under the mortgage if the borrower defaults in payment or performance of its obligations under the promissory note or mortgage the lender has the right to institute foreclosure proceedings to sell the real property at public auction to satisfy the indebtedness   foreclosure procedures vary from state to state   two primary methods of foreclosing a mortgage are judicial foreclosure involving court proceedings and nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale granted in the mortgage instrument other foreclosure procedures are available in some states but they are either infrequently used or available only in limited circumstances   a foreclosure action is subject to most of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if defenses are raised or counterclaims are interposed and sometimes requires several years to complete   see also “risk factors—risks relating to the mortgage loans—risks associated with one action rules”        judicial foreclosure   a judicial foreclosure proceeding is conducted in a court having jurisdiction over the mortgaged property generally the action is initiated by the service of legal pleadings upon all parties having a subordinate interest of record in the real property and all parties in possession of the property under leases or otherwise whose interests are subordinate to the mortgage delays in completion of the foreclosure may occasionally result from difficulties in locating defendants when the lender’s right to foreclose is contested the legal proceedings can be timeconsuming upon successful completion of a judicial foreclosure proceeding the court generally issues a judgment of foreclosure and appoints a referee or other officer to conduct a public sale of the mortgaged property the proceeds of which are used to satisfy the judgment such sales are made in accordance with procedures that vary from state to state   equitable and other limitations on enforceability of certain provisions   united states courts have traditionally imposed general equitable principles to limit the remedies available to lenders in foreclosure actions these principles are generally designed to relieve borrowers from the effects of mortgage defaults perceived as harsh or unfair relying on such principles a court may alter the specific terms of a loan to the extent it considers necessary to prevent or remedy an injustice undue oppression or overreaching or may require the lender to undertake affirmative actions to determine the cause of the borrower’s default and the likelihood that the borrower will be able to reinstate the loan in some cases courts have substituted their judgment for the lender’s and have required that lenders reinstate loans or recast payment schedules in order to accommodate borrowers who are suffering from a temporary financial disability in other cases courts have limited the right of the lender to foreclose in the case of a nonmonetary default such as a failure to adequately maintain the mortgaged property or an impermissible further encumbrance of the mortgaged property finally some courts have addressed the issue of whether federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that a borrower receive notice in addition to statutorilyprescribed minimum notice for the most part these cases have upheld the reasonableness of the notice provisions or have found that a public sale under a mortgage providing for a power of sale does not involve sufficient state action to trigger constitutional protections   in addition some states may have statutory protection such as the right of the borrower to reinstate a mortgage loan after commencement of foreclosure proceedings but prior to a foreclosure sale   nonjudicial foreclosurepower of sale   in states permitting nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings foreclosure of a deed of trust is generally accomplished by a nonjudicial trustee’s sale pursuant to a power of sale typically granted in the deed of trust a power of sale may also be contained in any other type of mortgage instrument if applicable law so permits a power of sale under a deed of trust allows a nonjudicial public sale to be conducted generally following a request from the beneficiarylender to the trustee to sell the property upon default by the borrower and after notice of sale is given in accordance with the terms of the mortgage and applicable state law in some states prior to such sale the trustee under the deed of trust must record a notice of default and notice of sale and send a copy to the borrower and to any other party who has recorded a request for a copy of a notice of default and notice of sale in addition in some states the trustee must provide notice to any other party having an interest of record in the real property including junior lienholders a notice of sale must be posted in a public place and in most states published for a specified period of time in one or more        newspapers the borrower or junior lienholder may then have the right during a reinstatement period required in some states to cure the default by paying the entire actual amount in arrears without regard to the acceleration of the indebtedness plus the lender’s expenses incurred in enforcing the obligation in other states the borrower or the junior lienholder is not provided a period to reinstate the loan but has only the right to pay off the entire debt to prevent the foreclosure sale generally state law governs the procedure for public sale the parties entitled to notice the method of giving notice and the applicable time periods   public sale   a third party may be unwilling to purchase a mortgaged property at a public sale because of the difficulty in determining the exact status of title to the property due to among other things redemption rights that may exist and because of the possibility that physical deterioration of the mortgaged property may have occurred during the foreclosure proceedings potential buyers may also be reluctant to purchase mortgaged property at a foreclosure sale as a result of the  decision of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in durrett v washington national insurance co  fd  th cir  and other decisions that have followed its reasoning the court in durrett held that even a noncollusive regularly conducted foreclosure sale was a fraudulent transfer under the bankruptcy code and thus could be rescinded in favor of the bankrupt’s estate if  the foreclosure sale was held while the debtor was insolvent and not more than one year prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition and  the price paid for the foreclosed property did not represent “fair consideration” which is “reasonably equivalent value” under the bankruptcy code although the reasoning and result of durrett in respect of the bankruptcy code was rejected by the united states supreme court in bfp v resolution trust corp  us   the case could nonetheless be persuasive to a court applying a state fraudulent conveyance law which has provisions similar to those construed in durrett therefore it is common for the lender to purchase the mortgaged property for an amount equal to the secured indebtedness and accrued and unpaid interest plus the expenses of foreclosure in which event the borrower’s debt will be extinguished or for a lesser amount in order to preserve its right to seek a deficiency judgment if such is available under state law and under the terms of the mortgage loan documents thereafter subject to the borrower’s right in some states to remain in possession during a redemption period the lender will become the owner of the property and have both the benefits and burdens of ownership including the obligation to pay debt service on any senior mortgages to pay taxes to obtain casualty insurance and to make such repairs as are necessary to render the property suitable for sale frequently the lender employs a thirdparty management company to manage and operate the property the costs of operating and maintaining a property may be significant and may be greater than the income derived from that property the costs of management and operation of those mortgaged properties which are hotels motels restaurants nursing or convalescent homes hospitals or casinos may be particularly significant because of the expertise knowledge and with respect to certain property types regulatory compliance required to run those operations and the effect which foreclosure and a change in ownership may have on the public’s and the industry’s including franchisors’ perception of the quality of those operations the lender also will commonly obtain the services of a real estate broker and pay the broker’s commission in connection with the sale or lease of the property depending upon market conditions the ultimate proceeds of the sale of a property may not equal the lender’s investment in the property moreover a lender commonly incurs substantial legal fees and court costs in acquiring a mortgaged property through contested foreclosure andor bankruptcy proceedings because of the expenses associated with acquiring owning and selling a mortgaged property a lender could realize an overall loss on a mortgage loan even if the        mortgaged property is sold at foreclosure or resold after it is acquired through foreclosure for an amount equal to the full outstanding principal amount of the loan plus accrued interest   furthermore an increasing number of states require that any environmental contamination at certain types of properties be cleaned up before a property may be resold in addition a lender may be responsible under federal or state law for the cost of cleaning up a mortgaged property that is environmentally contaminated see “—environmental considerations” below   the holder of a junior mortgage that forecloses on a mortgaged property does so subject to senior mortgages and any other prior liens and may be obliged to keep senior mortgage loans current in order to avoid foreclosure of its interest in the property in addition if the foreclosure of a junior mortgage triggers the enforcement of a “dueonsale” clause contained in a senior mortgage the junior mortgagee could be required to pay the full amount of the senior mortgage indebtedness or face foreclosure   rights of redemption   the purposes of a foreclosure action are to enable the lender to realize upon its security and to bar the borrower and all persons who have interests in the property that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender from exercise of their “equity of redemption” the doctrine of equity of redemption provides that until the property encumbered by a mortgage has been sold in accordance with a properly conducted foreclosure and foreclosure sale those having interests that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender have an equity of redemption and may redeem the property by paying the entire debt with interest those having an equity of redemption must generally be made parties and joined in the foreclosure proceeding in order for their equity of redemption to be terminated   the equity of redemption is a commonlaw nonstatutory right which should be distinguished from postsale statutory rights of redemption in some states after sale pursuant to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage the borrower and foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which to redeem the property in some states statutory redemption may occur only upon payment of the foreclosure sale price in other states redemption may be permitted if the former borrower pays only a portion of the sums due the effect of a statutory right of redemption is to diminish the ability of the lender to sell the foreclosed property because the exercise of a right of redemption would defeat the title of any purchaser through a foreclosure consequently the practical effect of the redemption right is to force the lender to maintain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has expired in some states a postsale statutory right of redemption may exist following a judicial foreclosure but not following a trustee’s sale under a deed of trust   antideficiency legislation   some or all of the mortgage loans are nonrecourse loans as to which recourse in the case of default will be limited to the mortgaged property and such other assets if any that were pledged to secure the mortgage loan however even if a mortgage loan by its terms provides for recourse to the borrower’s other assets a lender’s ability to realize upon those assets may be limited by state law for example in some states a lender cannot obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower following foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust        a deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against the former borrower equal to the difference between the net amount realized upon the public sale of the real property and the amount due to the lender other statutes may require the lender to exhaust the security afforded under a mortgage before bringing a personal action against the borrower in certain other states the lender has the option of bringing a personal action against the borrower on the debt without first exhausting that security however in some of those states the lender following judgment on that personal action may be deemed to have elected a remedy and thus may be precluded from foreclosing upon the security consequently lenders in those states where such an election of remedy provision exists will usually proceed first against the security finally other statutory provisions designed to protect borrowers from exposure to large deficiency judgments that might result from bidding at belowmarket values at the foreclosure sale limit any deficiency judgment to the excess of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale   leasehold considerations   mortgage loans may be secured by a mortgage on the borrower’s leasehold interest in a ground lease leasehold mortgage loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower the most significant of these risks is that if the borrower’s leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default the leasehold mortgagee would lose its security this risk may be lessened if the ground lease requires the lessor to give the leasehold mortgagee notices of lessee defaults and an opportunity to cure them permits the leasehold estate to be assigned to and by the leasehold mortgagee or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale and contains certain other protective provisions typically included in a “mortgageable” ground lease certain mortgage loans however may be secured by ground leases which do not contain these provisions   in addition where a lender has as its security both the fee and leasehold interest in the same property the grant of a mortgage lien on its fee interest by the land ownerground lessor to secure the debt of a borrowerground lessee may be subject to challenge as a fraudulent conveyance among other things a legal challenge to the granting of the liens may focus on the benefits realized by the land ownerground lessor from the loan if a court concluded that the granting of the mortgage lien was an avoidable fraudulent conveyance it might take actions detrimental to the holders of the offered certificates including under certain circumstances invalidating the mortgage lien on the fee interest of the land ownerground lessor   cooperative shares   mortgage loans may be secured by a security interest on the borrower’s ownership interest in shares and the related proprietary leases allocable to cooperative dwelling units that may be vacant or occupied by nonowner tenants such loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of a borrower in real property such a loan typically is subordinate to the mortgage if any on the cooperative’s building which if foreclosed could extinguish the equity in the building and the proprietary leases of the dwelling units derived from ownership of the shares of the cooperative further transfer of shares in a cooperative are subject to various regulations as well as to restrictions under the governing documents of the cooperative and the shares may be cancelled in the event that associated maintenance charges due under the related proprietary leases are not paid typically a recognition agreement between the lender and the cooperative provides among other things the lender with an opportunity to cure a default under a proprietary lease        under the laws applicable in many states “foreclosure” on cooperative shares is accomplished by a sale in accordance with the provisions of article  of the ucc and the security agreement relating to the shares article  of the ucc requires that a sale be conducted in a “commercially reasonable” manner which may be dependent upon among other things the notice given the debtor and the method manner time place and terms of the sale article  of the ucc provides that the proceeds of the sale will be applied first to pay the costs and expenses of the sale and then to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the lender’s security interest a recognition agreement however generally provides that the lender’s right to reimbursement is subject to the right of the cooperative to receive sums due under the proprietary leases   bankruptcy laws   operation of the federal bankruptcy code in title  of the united states code as amended from time to time “bankruptcy code” and related state laws may interfere with or affect the ability of a lender to obtain payment of a loan realize upon collateral andor to enforce a deficiency judgment for example under the bankruptcy code virtually all actions including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment proceedings are automatically stayed upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition and usually no interest or principal payments are made during the course of the bankruptcy case the delay and the consequences of a delay caused by an automatic stay can be significant for example the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior mortgage lien holder may stay the senior lender from taking action to foreclose out such junior lien at a minimum the senior lender would suffer delay due to its need to seek bankruptcy court approval before taking any foreclosure or other action that could be deemed in violation of the automatic stay under the bankruptcy code   under the bankruptcy code a bankruptcy trustee or a borrower as debtorinpossession may under certain circumstances sell the related mortgaged property or other collateral free and clear of all liens claims encumbrances and interests which liens would then attach to the proceeds of such sale despite the provisions of the related mortgage or other security agreement to the contrary such a sale may be approved by a bankruptcy court even if the proceeds are insufficient to pay the secured debt in full   under the bankruptcy code provided certain substantive and procedural safeguards for a lender are met the amount and terms of a mortgage or other security agreement secured by property of a debtor may be modified under certain circumstances pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization lien avoidance or claim objection proceeding the secured claim arising from a loan secured by real property or other collateral may be reduced to the thencurrent value of the property with a corresponding partial reduction of the amount of lender’s security interest thus leaving the lender a secured creditor to the extent of the then current value of the property and a general unsecured creditor for the difference between such value and the outstanding balance of the loan such general unsecured claims may be paid less than  of the amount of the debt or not at all depending upon the circumstances other modifications may include the reduction in the amount of each scheduled payment which reduction may result from a reduction in the rate of interest andor the alteration of the repayment schedule with or without affecting the unpaid principal balance of the loan andor an extension or reduction of the final maturity date some courts have approved bankruptcy plans based on the particular facts of the reorganization case that effected the curing of a mortgage loan default by paying arrearages over a number of years also under the bankruptcy code a bankruptcy court may permit a debtor through its plan of reorganization to reinstate the loan even though the lender accelerated the mortgage loan and final judgment of foreclosure had been entered in        state court provided that no sale of the property had yet occurred prior to the filing of the debtor’s petition this may be done even if the plan of reorganization does not provide for payment of the full amount due under the original loan thus the full amount due under the original loan may never be repaid other types of significant modifications to the terms of mortgage loan may be acceptable to the bankruptcy court such as making distributions to the mortgage holder of property other than cash or the substitution of collateral which is the “indubitable equivalent” of the real property subject to the mortgage or the subordination of the mortgage to liens securing new debt provided that the lender’s secured claim is “adequately protected” as such term is defined and interpreted under the bankruptcy code often depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the specific case   federal bankruptcy law may also interfere with or otherwise adversely affect the ability of a secured mortgage lender to enforce an assignment by a borrower of rents and leases which “rents” may include revenues from hotels and other lodging facilities specified in the bankruptcy code related to a mortgaged property if the related borrower is in a bankruptcy proceeding under the bankruptcy code a lender may be stayed from enforcing the assignment and the legal proceedings necessary to resolve the issue can be time consuming and may result in significant delays in the receipt of the rents rents including applicable hotel and other lodging revenues and leases may also escape such an assignment among other things i if the assignment is not fully perfected under state law prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding ii to the extent such rents and leases are used by the borrower to maintain the mortgaged property or for other court authorized expenses iii to the extent other collateral may be substituted for the rents and leases iv to the extent the bankruptcy court determines that the lender is adequately protected or v to the extent the court determines based on the equities of the case that the postpetition rents are not subject to the lender’s prepetition securities interest   under the bankruptcy code a security interest in real property acquired before the commencement of the bankruptcy case does not extend to income received after the commencement of the bankruptcy case unless such income is a proceed product or rent of such property therefore to the extent a business conducted on the mortgaged property creates accounts receivable rather than rents or results from payments under a license rather than payments under a lease a valid and perfected prebankruptcy lien on such accounts receivable or license income generally would not continue as to postbankruptcy accounts receivable or license income   the bankruptcy code provides that a lender’s perfected prepetition security interest in leases rents and hotel revenues continues in the postpetition leases rents and hotel revenues unless a bankruptcy court orders to the contrary “based on the equities of the case” the equities of a particular case may permit the discontinuance of security interests in prepetition leases and rents thus unless a court orders otherwise revenues from a mortgaged property generated after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed will constitute “cash collateral” under the bankruptcy code debtors may only use cash collateral upon obtaining the lender’s consent or a prior court order finding that the lender’s interest in the mortgaged hotel motel or other lodging property and the cash collateral is “adequately protected” as the term is defined and interpreted under the bankruptcy code in addition to postpetition rents any cash held by a lender in a lockbox or reserve account generally would also constitute “cash collateral” under the bankruptcy code so long as the lender is adequately protected a debtor’s use of cash collateral may be for its own benefit or for the benefit of any affiliated entity group that is also subject to bankruptcy proceedings including use as collateral for new debt it should be noted however that the court may find that the lender has no security interest in either prepetition or postpetition revenues if        the court finds that the loan documents do not contain language covering accounts room rents or other forms of personality necessary for a security interest to attach to such revenues   the bankruptcy code provides generally that rights and obligations under an unexpired lease of the debtorlessee may not be terminated or modified at any time after the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code solely because of a provision in the lease to that effect or because of certain other similar events this prohibition on socalled “ipso facto” clauses could limit the ability of a lender to exercise certain contractual remedies with respect to the leases on any mortgaged property in addition section  of the bankruptcy code operates as an automatic stay of among other things any act to obtain possession of property from a debtor’s estate which may delay a lender’s exercise of those remedies including foreclosure in the event that a lessee becomes the subject of a proceeding under the bankruptcy code thus the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a lessee of a mortgaged property would result in a stay against the commencement or continuation of any state court proceeding for past due rent for accelerated rent for damages or for a summary eviction order with respect to a default under the related lease that occurred prior to the filing of the lessee’s petition while relief from the automatic stay to enforce remedies may be requested it can be denied for a number of reasons including where the collateral is “necessary to an effective reorganization” for the debtor and if a debtor’s case has been administratively consolidated with those of its affiliates the court may also consider whether the property is “necessary to an effective reorganization” of the debtor and its affiliates taken as a whole   the bankruptcy code generally provides that a trustee in bankruptcy or debtorinpossession may with respect to an unexpired lease of nonresidential real property before the earlier of i  days after the filing of a bankruptcy case or ii the entry of an order confirming a plan subject to approval of the court a assume the lease and retain it or assign it to a third party or b reject the lease if the trustee or debtorinpossession fails to assume or reject the lease within the time specified in the preceding sentence subject to any extensions by the bankruptcy court the lease will be deemed rejected and the property will be surrendered to the lessor the bankruptcy court may for cause shown extend the day period up to  days for a total of  days if the lease is assumed the trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of the lessee or the lessee as debtorinpossession or the assignee if applicable must cure any defaults under the lease compensate the lessor for its losses and provide the lessor with “adequate assurance” of future performance these remedies may be insufficient however as the lessor may be forced to continue under the lease with a lessee that is a poor credit risk or an unfamiliar tenant if the lease was assigned and any assurances provided to the lessor may in fact be inadequate if the lease is rejected the rejection generally constitutes a breach of the executory contract or unexpired lease as of the date immediately preceding the filing date of the bankruptcy petition as a consequence the other party or parties to the lease such as the borrower as lessor under a lease generally would have only an unsecured claim against the debtor as lessee for damages resulting from the breach which could adversely affect the security for the related mortgage loan in addition under the bankruptcy code a lease rejection damages claim is limited to the “a rent reserved by the lease without acceleration for the greater of one year or  percent not to exceed  years of the remaining term of such lease following the earlier of the date of the bankruptcy petition and the date on which the lessor regained possession of the real property b plus any unpaid rent due under such lease without acceleration on the earlier of such dates”   if a trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of a lessor or a lessor as debtorinpossession rejects an unexpired lease of real property the lessee may treat the lease as terminated by        the rejection or in the alternative the lessee may remain in possession of the leasehold for the balance of the term and for any renewal or extension of the term that is enforceable by the lessee under applicable nonbankruptcy law the bankruptcy code provides that if a lessee elects to remain in possession after a rejection of a lease the lessee may offset against rents reserved under the lease for the balance of the term after the date of rejection of the lease and the related renewal or extension of the lease any damages occurring after that date caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the lessor under the lease after that date   similarly bankruptcy risk is associated with an insolvency proceeding under the bankruptcy code of either a borrower ground lessee or a ground lessor in general upon the bankruptcy of a lessor or a lessee under a lease of nonresidential real property including a ground lease that has not been terminated prior to the bankruptcy filing date the debtor entity has the statutory right to assume or reject the lease given that the bankruptcy code generally invalidates clauses that terminate contracts automatically upon the filing by one of the parties of a bankruptcy petition or that are conditioned on a party’s insolvency following the filing of a bankruptcy petition a debtor would ordinarily be required to perform its obligations under such lease until the debtor decides whether to assume or reject the lease the bankruptcy code provides certain additional protections with respect to nonresidential real property leases such as establishing a specific timeframe in which a debtor must determine whether to assume or reject the lease the bankruptcy court may extend the time to perform for up to  days for cause shown even if the agreements were terminated prior to bankruptcy a bankruptcy court may determine that the agreement was improperly terminated and therefore remains part of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate the debtor also can seek bankruptcy court approval to assume and assign the lease to a third party and to modify the lease in connection with such assignment in order to assume the lease the debtor or assignee generally will have to cure outstanding defaults and provide “adequate assurance of future performance” in addition to satisfying other requirements imposed under the bankruptcy code under the bankruptcy code subject to certain exceptions once a lease is rejected by a debtor lessee it is deemed breached and the nondebtor lessor will have a claim for lease rejection damages as described above   if the ground lessor files for bankruptcy it may determine until the confirmation of its plan of reorganization whether to reject the ground lease on request of any party to the lease the bankruptcy court may order the debtor to determine within a specific period of time whether to assume or reject the lease or to comply with the terms of the lease pending its decision to assume or reject in the event of rejection the nondebtor lessee will have the right to treat the lease as terminated by virtue of its terms applicable nonbankruptcy law or any agreement made by the lessee the nondebtor lessee may also if the lease term has begun retain its rights under the lease including its rights to remain in possession of the leased premises under the rent reserved in the lease for the balance of the term of the lease including renewals the term “lessee” includes any “successor assign or mortgagee permitted under the terms of such lease” if prepetition the ground lessor had specifically granted the leasehold mortgagee such right the leasehold mortgagee may have the right to succeed to the lesseeborrower’s position under the lease   in the event of concurrent bankruptcy proceedings involving the ground lessor and the lesseeborrower actions by creditors against the borrowerlessee debtor would be subject to the automatic stay and a lender may be unable to enforce both the bankrupt lessee’sborrower’s prepetition agreement to refuse to treat a ground lease rejected by a bankrupt lessor as terminated and any agreement by the ground lessor to grant the lender a new lease upon such termination in such circumstances a lease could be terminated        notwithstanding lender protection provisions contained in that lease or in the mortgage a lender could lose its security unless the lender holds a fee mortgage or the bankruptcy court as a court of equity allows the mortgagee to assume the ground lessee’s obligations under the ground lease and succeed to the ground lessee’s position although consistent with the bankruptcy code such position may not be adopted by the bankruptcy court   further in an appellate decision by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit precision indus v qualitech steel sbq llc  fd  th cir  the court ruled with respect to an unrecorded lease of real property that where a statutory sale of leased property occurs under the bankruptcy code upon the bankruptcy of a landlord that sale terminates a lessee’s possessory interest in the property and the purchaser assumes title free and clear of any interest including any leasehold estates pursuant to the bankruptcy code a lessee may request the bankruptcy court to prohibit or condition the statutory sale of the property so as to provide adequate protection of the leasehold interest however the court ruled that at least where a memorandum of lease had not been recorded this provision does not ensure continued possession of the property but rather entitles the lessee to compensation for the value of its leasehold interest typically from the sale proceeds as a result we cannot assure you that in the event of a statutory sale of leased property pursuant to the bankruptcy code the lessee would be able to maintain possession of the property under the ground lease in addition we cannot assure you that a leasehold mortgagor andor a leasehold mortgagee to the extent it has standing to intervene would be able to recover the full value of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy court   because of the possible termination of the related ground lease whether arising from a bankruptcy the expiration of a lease term or an uncured defect under the related ground lease lending on a leasehold interest in a real property is riskier than lending on the fee interest in the property   in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving a borrower action may be taken seeking the recovery as a preferential transfer of any payments made by such borrower or made directly by the related lessee under the related mortgage loan to the issuing entity payments on long term debt may be protected from recovery as preferences if they qualify for the “ordinary course” exception under the bankruptcy code or if certain other defenses in the bankruptcy code are applicable whether any particular payment would be protected depends upon the facts specific to a particular transaction   in addition in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving any borrower or an affiliate an action may be taken to avoid the transaction or any component of the transaction such as joint and several liability on the related mortgage loan as an actual or constructive fraudulent conveyance under state or federal law any payment by a borrower in excess of its allocated share of the loan could be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance by creditors of that borrower in an action outside a bankruptcy case or by the representative of the borrower’s bankruptcy estate in a bankruptcy case generally under federal and most state fraudulent conveyance statutes the incurrence of an obligation or the transfer of property by a person will be subject to avoidance under certain circumstances if the person transferred such property with the intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors or the person did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such obligation or transfer and i was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by such obligation or transfer ii was engaged in business or a transaction or was about to engage in business or a transaction for which any property remaining with the person constituted unreasonably small capital or iii intended to or believed that it would incur debts that would be beyond the person’s ability to pay as such debts matured the measure of insolvency will vary depending on the law of the applicable jurisdiction however an entity        will generally be considered insolvent if the present fair salable value of its assets is less than x the sum of its debts or y the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured accordingly a lien granted by a borrower to secure repayment of the loan in excess of its allocated share could be avoided if a court were to determine that i such borrower was insolvent at the time of granting the lien was rendered insolvent by the granting of the lien was left with inadequate capital or was not able to pay its debts as they matured and ii the borrower did not when it allowed its property to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness represented by the loan receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for pledging such property for the equal benefit of each other borrower   a bankruptcy court may under certain circumstances authorize a debtor to obtain credit after the commencement of a bankruptcy case secured among other things by senior equal or junior liens on property that is already subject to a lien in the bankruptcy case of general growth properties filed on april   the debtors initially sought approval of a debtorinpossession loan to the corporate parent entities guaranteed by the propertylevel single purpose entities and secured by second liens on their properties although the debtorinpossession loan subsequently was modified to eliminate the subsidiary guarantees and second liens we cannot assure you that in the event of a bankruptcy of the borrower sponsor the borrower sponsor would not seek approval of a similar debtorinpossession loan or that a bankruptcy court would not approve a debtorinpossession loan that included such subsidiary guarantees and second liens on such subsidiaries’ properties   certain of the borrowers may be partnerships the laws governing limited partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code with respect to a general partner will cause a person to cease to be a general partner of the limited partnership unless otherwise provided in writing in the limited partnership agreement this provision may be construed as an “ipso facto” clause and in the event of the general partner’s bankruptcy may not be enforceable certain limited partnership agreements of the borrowers may provide that the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code with respect to the related general partner constitutes an event of withdrawal assuming the enforceability of the clause is not challenged in bankruptcy proceedings or if challenged is upheld that might trigger the dissolution of the limited partnership the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets unless i at the time there was at least one other general partner and the written provisions of the limited partnership permit the business of the limited partnership to be carried on by the remaining general partner and that general partner does so or ii the written provisions of the limited partnership agreement permit the limited partners to agree within a specified time frame often  days after the withdrawal to continue the business of the limited partnership and to the appointment of one or more general partners and the limited partners do so in addition the laws governing general partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the bankruptcy code or state bankruptcy laws with respect to a general partner of the partnerships triggers the dissolution of the partnership the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets those state laws however may not be enforceable or effective in a bankruptcy case limited liability companies may be subjected to similar treatment as that described in this prospectus with respect to limited partnerships the dissolution of a borrower the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets could result in an acceleration of its payment obligation under the borrower’s mortgage loan which may reduce the yield on the offered certificates in the same manner as a principal prepayment        in addition the bankruptcy of the general or limited partner of a borrower that is a partnership or the bankruptcy of a member of a borrower that is a limited liability company or the bankruptcy of a shareholder of a borrower that is a corporation may provide the opportunity in the bankruptcy case of the partner member or shareholder to obtain an order from a court consolidating the assets and liabilities of the partner member or shareholder with those of the mortgagor pursuant to the doctrines of substantive consolidation or piercing the corporate veil in such a case the respective mortgaged property for example would become property of the estate of the bankrupt partner member or shareholder not only would the mortgaged property be available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the partner member or shareholder but an automatic stay would apply to any attempt by the trustee to exercise remedies with respect to the mortgaged property however such an occurrence should not affect a lender’s status as a secured creditor with respect to the mortgagor or its security interest in the mortgaged property   a borrower that is a limited partnership in many cases may be required by the loan documents to have a single purpose entity as its sole general partner and a borrower that is a general partnership in many cases may be required by the loan documents to have as its general partners only entities that are single purpose entities a borrower that is a limited liability company may be required by the loan documents to have a single purpose member or a springing member all borrowers that are tenantsincommon may be required by the loan documents to be single purpose entities these provisions are designed to mitigate the risk of the dissolution or bankruptcy of the borrower partnership or its general partner a borrower limited liability company or its member if applicable or a borrower that is a tenantincommon however we cannot assure you that any borrower partnership or its general partner or any borrower limited liability company or its member if applicable or a borrower that is a tenantincommon will not dissolve or become a debtor under the bankruptcy code   environmental considerations   general   a lender may be subject to environmental risks when taking a security interest in real property of particular concern may be properties that are or have been used for industrial manufacturing military or disposal activity such environmental risks include the possible diminution of the value of a contaminated property or as discussed below potential liability for cleanup costs or other remedial actions that could exceed the value of the property or the amount of the lender’s loan in certain circumstances a lender may decide to abandon a contaminated mortgaged property as collateral for its loan rather than foreclose and risk liability for cleanup costs   superlien laws   under the laws of many states contamination on a property may give rise to a lien on the property for cleanup costs in several states such a lien has priority over all existing liens including those of existing mortgages in these states the lien of a mortgage may lose its priority to such a “superlien”   cercla   the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended “cercla” imposes strict liability on present and past “owners” and “operators” of contaminated real property for the costs of cleanup a secured lender may be liable as an “owner” or “operator” of a contaminated mortgaged property if agents or        employees of the lender have participated in the management or operation of such mortgaged property such liability may exist even if the lender did not cause or contribute to the contamination and regardless of whether the lender has actually taken possession of a mortgaged property through foreclosure deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise moreover such liability is not limited to the original or unamortized principal balance of a loan or to the value of the property securing a loan excluded from cercla’s definition of “owner” or “operator” however is a person “who without participating in the management of the facility holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest” this is the so called “secured creditor exemption”   the asset conservation lender liability and deposit insurance protection act of  the “ act” amended among other things the provisions of cercla with respect to lender liability and the secured creditor exemption the  act offers protection to lenders by defining the activities in which a lender can engage and still have the benefit of the secured creditor exemption in order for a lender to be deemed to have participated in the management of a mortgaged property the lender must actually participate in the operational affairs of the property of the borrower the  act provides that “merely having the capacity to influence or unexercised right to control” operations does not constitute participation in management a lender will lose the protection of the secured creditor exemption if it exercises decisionmaking control over the borrower’s environmental compliance and hazardous substance handling or disposal practices or assumes daytoday management of environmental or substantially all other operational functions of the mortgaged property the  act also provides that a lender will continue to have the benefit of the secured creditor exemption even if it forecloses on a mortgaged property purchases it at a foreclosure sale or accepts a deedinlieu of foreclosure provided that the lender seeks to sell the mortgaged property at the earliest practicable commercially reasonable time on commercially reasonable terms   certain other federal and state laws   many states have statutes similar to cercla and not all of those statutes provide for a secured creditor exemption in addition under federal law there is potential liability relating to hazardous wastes and underground storage tanks under the federal resource conservation and recovery act   some federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the management removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestoscontaining materials these laws as well as common law standards may impose liability for releases of or exposure to asbestoscontaining materials and provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injuries associated with those releases   federal legislation requires owners of residential housing constructed prior to  to disclose to potential residents or purchasers any known leadbased paint hazards and will impose treble damages for any failure to disclose in addition the ingestion of leadbased paint chips or dust particles by children can result in lead poisoning if leadbased paint hazards exist at a property then the owner of that property may be held liable for injuries and for the costs of removal or encapsulation of the leadbased paint   in a few states transfers of some types of properties are conditioned upon cleanup of contamination prior to transfer in these cases a lender that becomes the owner of a property through foreclosure deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise may be required to cleanup the contamination before selling or otherwise transferring the property        beyond statutebased environmental liability there exist common law causes of action for example actions based on nuisance or on toxic tort resulting in death personal injury or damage to property related to hazardous environmental conditions on a property while it may be more difficult to hold a lender liable under common law causes of action unanticipated or uninsured liabilities of the borrower may jeopardize the borrower’s ability to meet its loan obligations or may decrease the resale value of the collateral   additional considerations   the cost of remediating hazardous substance contamination at a property can be substantial if a lender becomes liable it can bring an action for contribution against the owner or operator who created the environmental hazard but that individual or entity may be without substantial assets accordingly it is possible that such costs could become a liability of the issuing entity and occasion a loss to the certificateholders   if a lender forecloses on a mortgage secured by a property the operations on which are subject to environmental laws and regulations the lender will be required to operate the property in accordance with those laws and regulations such compliance may entail substantial expense especially in the case of industrial or manufacturing properties   in addition a lender may be obligated to disclose environmental conditions on a property to government entities andor to prospective buyers including prospective buyers at a foreclosure sale or following foreclosure such disclosure may decrease the amount that prospective buyers are willing to pay for the affected property sometimes substantially and thereby decrease the ability of the lender to recover its investment in a loan upon foreclosure   dueonsale and dueonencumbrance provisions   certain of the mortgage loans may contain “dueonsale” and “dueonencumbrance” clauses that purport to permit the lender to accelerate the maturity of the loan if the borrower transfers or encumbers the related mortgaged property the garnst germain depository institutions act of  the “garn act” generally preempts state laws that prohibit the enforcement of dueonsale clauses and permits lenders to enforce these clauses in accordance with their terms subject to certain limitations as set forth in the garn act and related regulations accordingly a lender may nevertheless have the right to accelerate the maturity of a mortgage loan that contains a “dueonsale” provision upon transfer of an interest in the property without regard to the lender’s ability to demonstrate that a sale threatens its legitimate security interest   subordinate financing   the terms of certain of the mortgage loans may not restrict the ability of the borrower to use the mortgaged property as security for one or more additional loans or such restrictions may be unenforceable where a borrower encumbers a mortgaged property with one or more junior liens the senior lender is subjected to additional risk first the borrower may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans moreover if the subordinate financing permits recourse to the borrower asis frequently the case and the senior loan does not a borrower may have more incentive to repay sums due on the subordinate loan second acts of the senior lender that prejudice the junior lender or impair the junior lender’s security may create a superior equity in favor of the junior lender for example if the borrower and the senior lender agree to an increase in the principal amount of or the interest rate payable on the senior loan the senior lender may lose its priority to the extent any existing junior lender is harmed or the borrower is additionally burdened third if the        borrower defaults on the senior loan andor any junior loan or loans the existence of junior loans and actions taken by junior lenders can impair the security available to the senior lender and can interfere with or delay the taking of action by the senior lender moreover the bankruptcy of a junior lender may operate to stay foreclosure or similar proceedings by the senior lender   default interest and limitations on prepayments   promissory notes and mortgages may contain provisions that obligate the borrower to pay a late charge or additional interest if payments are not timely made and in some circumstances may prohibit prepayments for a specified period andor condition prepayments upon the borrower’s payment of prepayment fees or yield maintenance penalties in certain states there are or may be specific limitations upon the late charges which a lender may collect from a borrower for delinquent payments certain states also limit the amounts that a lender may collect from a borrower as an additional charge if the loan is prepaid in addition the enforceability of provisions that provide for prepayment fees or penalties upon an involuntary prepayment is unclear under the laws of many states   applicability of usury laws   title v of the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of  “title v” provides that state usury limitations will not apply to certain types of residential including multifamily first mortgage loans originated by certain lenders after march   title v authorized any state to reimpose interest rate limits by adopting before april   a law or constitutional provision that expressly rejects application of the federal law in addition even where title v is not so rejected any state is authorized by the law to adopt a provision limiting discount points or other charges on mortgage loans covered by title v certain states have taken action to reimpose interest rate limits andor to limit discount points or other charges   statutes differ in their provisions as to the consequences of a usurious loan one group of statutes requires the lender to forfeit the interest due above the applicable limit or impose a specified penalty under this statutory scheme the borrower may cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust upon paying its debt with lawful interest and the lender may foreclose but only for the debt plus lawful interest a second group of statutes is more severe a violation of this type of usury law results in the invalidation of the transaction thereby permitting the borrower to cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust without any payment or prohibiting the lender from foreclosing   americans with disabilities act   under title iii of the americans with disabilities act of  and related regulations collectively the “ada” in order to protect individuals with disabilities public accommodations such as hotel properties restaurants shopping centers hospitals schools and social service center establishments must remove architectural and communication barriers which are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation to the extent “readily achievable” in addition under the ada alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that to the maximum extent feasible such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals the “readily achievable” standard takes into account among other factors the financial resources of the affected site owner landlord or other applicable person in addition to imposing a possible financial burden on the borrower in its capacity as owner or landlord the ada may also impose such requirements on a foreclosing lender who succeeds to the interest of the borrower as owner or landlord furthermore since the “readily achievable”        standard may vary depending on the financial condition of the owner or landlord a foreclosing lender who is financially more capable than the borrower of complying with the requirements of the ada may be subject to more stringent requirements than those to which the borrower is subject   servicemembers civil relief act   under the terms of the servicemembers civil relief act as amended the “relief act” a borrower who enters military service after the origination of such borrower’s mortgage loan including a borrower who was in reserve status and is called to active duty after origination of the mortgage loan upon notification by such borrower will not be charged interest including fees and charges in excess of  per annum during the period of such borrower’s active duty status in addition to adjusting the interest the lender must forgive any such interest in excess of  unless a court or administrative agency orders otherwise upon application of the lender the relief act applies to individuals who are members of the army navy air force marines national guard reserves coast guard and officers of the us public health service or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration assigned to duty with the military because the relief act applies to individuals who enter military service including reservists who are called to active duty after origination of the related mortgage loan no information can be provided as to the number of loans with individuals as borrowers that may be affected by the relief act application of the relief act would adversely affect for an indeterminate period of time the ability of a master servicer or special servicer to collect full amounts of interest on certain of the mortgage loans any shortfalls in interest collections resulting from the application of the relief act would result in a reduction of the amounts distributable to the holders of certificates and would not be covered by advances or any form of credit support provided in connection with the certificates in addition the relief act imposes limitations that would impair the ability of a lender to foreclose on an affected mortgage loan during the borrower’s period of active duty status and under certain circumstances during an additional threemonth period thereafter   antimoney laundering economic sanctions and bribery   many jurisdictions have adopted wideranging antimoney laundering economic and trade sanctions and anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations collectively the “requirements” any of the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters or other party to the psa could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase certificates and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental regulatory or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future failure to honor any request by the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters or other party to the psa to provide requested information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the depositor the issuing entity the underwriters or other party to the psa to comply with any requirements related legal process or appropriate requests whether formal or informal may result in among other things a forced sale to

secrecy act us bank secrecy act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  also known as the “patriot act” and any other antimoney laundering and antiterrorism economic and trade sanctions and anticorruption or antibribery laws and regulations of the united states and other countries and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection with such compliance        potential forfeiture of assets   federal law provides that assets including property purchased or improved with assets derived from criminal activity or otherwise tainted or used in the commission of certain offenses is subject to the blocking requirements of economic sanctions laws and regulations and can be blocked andor seized and ordered forfeited to the united states of america the offenses that can trigger such a blocking andor seizure and forfeiture include among others violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act the us bank secrecy act the antimoney laundering antiterrorism economic sanctions and antibribery laws and regulations including the patriot act and the regulations issued pursuant to that act as well as the narcotic drug laws in many instances the united states may seize the property even before a conviction occurs   in the event of a forfeiture proceeding a lender may be able to establish its interest in the property by proving that a its mortgage was executed and recorded before the commission of the illegal conduct from which the assets used to purchase or improve the property were derived or before the commission of any other crime upon which the forfeiture is based or b the lender at the time of the execution of the mortgage “did not know or was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture” however there is no assurance that such a defense will be successful   certain affiliations

together with the net proceeds from the sale of the other certificates not being offered by this prospectus will be used by the depositor to purchase the mortgage loans from the mortgage loan sellers and to pay certain expenses in connection with the issuance of the certificates   yield and maturity considerations   yield considerations   general   the yield to maturity on the offered certificates will depend upon the price paid by the investors the rate and timing of the distributions in reduction of the certificate balance or notional amount of the applicable class of offered certificates the extent to which yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums allocated to the class of offered certificates are collected and the rate timing and severity of losses on the mortgage loans and the extent to which such losses are allocable in reduction of the certificate balance or notional amount of the class of offered certificates as well as prevailing interest rates at the time of payment or loss realization   rate and timing of principal payments   the rate and amount of distributions in reduction of the certificate balance of any class of offered certificates that are also principal balance certificates and the yield to maturity of any class of offered certificates will be directly related to the rate of payments of principal both scheduled and unscheduled on the mortgage loans as well as borrower defaults and the severity of losses occurring upon a default and the resulting rate and timing of collections made in connection with liquidations of mortgage loans due to these defaults principal payments on the mortgage loans will be affected by their amortization schedules lockout periods defeasance provisions provisions relating to the release andor application of earnout reserves provisions requiring prepayments in connection with the release of real property collateral requirements to pay yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums in connection with principal payments the dates on which balloon payments are due incentives for a borrower to repay an ard loan by the related anticipated repayment date property release provisions provisions relating to the application or release of earnout reserves and any extensions of maturity dates by the master servicer or the special servicer while voluntary prepayments of some mortgage loans are generally prohibited during applicable prepayment lockout periods effective prepayments may occur if a sufficiently significant portion of a mortgaged property is lost due to casualty or condemnation in addition such distributions in reduction of certificate balances of the        respective classes of offered certificates that are also principal balance certificates may result from repurchases of or substitutions for mortgage loans made by the sponsors due to missing or defective documentation or breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans as described under “description of the mortgage loan purchase agreements” or purchases of the mortgage loans in the manner described under “pooling and servicing agreement—termination retirement of certificates” to the extent a mortgage loan requires payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium in connection with a voluntary prepayment any such yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium generally is not due in connection with a prepayment due to casualty or condemnation is not included in the purchase price of a mortgage loan purchased or repurchased due to a breach of a representation or warranty or otherwise and may not be enforceable or collectible upon a default   because the certificates with notional amounts are not entitled to distributions of principal the yield on such certificates will be extremely sensitive to prepayments received in respect of the mortgage loans to the extent distributed to reduce the related notional amount of the applicable class of certificates in addition although the borrower under an ard loan may have certain incentives to prepay such ard loan on its anticipated repayment date we cannot assure you that the borrower will be able to prepay such ard loan on its related anticipated repayment date the failure of the borrower to prepay an ard loan on its anticipated repayment date will not be an event of default under the terms of such ard loan and pursuant to the terms of the psa neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be permitted to take any enforcement action with respect to the borrower’s failure to pay excess interest until the scheduled maturity of such ard loan provided that the master servicer or the special servicer as the case may be may take action to enforce the issuing entity’s right to apply excess cash flow to principal in accordance with the terms of the respective ard loan documents with respect to the class asb certificates the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and the sensitivity of the class asb certificates to principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period of time during which the class a class aa class ab class a and class a certificates remain outstanding as such the class asb certificates will become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were when the class a class aa class ab class a and class a certificates were outstanding   the extent to which the yield to maturity of any class of offered certificates may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which the certificates are purchased at a discount or premium and when and to what degree payments of principal on the mortgage loans are in turn distributed on the certificates or in the case of the class xa or class xb certificates with a notional amount applied to reduce their notional amounts an investor should consider in the case of any certificate other than a certificate with a notional amount purchased at a discount the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans could result in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield and in the case of any certificate purchased at a premium including certificates with notional amounts the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments could result in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield in general the earlier a payment of principal on the mortgage loans is distributed or otherwise results in reduction of the certificate balance of a certificate purchased at a discount or premium the greater will be the effect on an investor’s yield to maturity as a result the effect on an investor’s yield of principal payments distributed on an investor’s certificates occurring at a rate higher or lower than the rate anticipated by the investor during any particular period would not be fully offset by a subsequent like reduction or increase in the rate of principal payments        the yield on each of the classes of certificates that have a passthrough rate equal to limited by or based on the wac rate could or in the case of any class of certificates with a passthrough rate equal to or based on the wac rate would be adversely affected if mortgage loans with higher mortgage rates prepay faster than mortgage loans with lower mortgage rates the passthrough rates on these classes of certificates may be adversely affected by a decrease in the wac rate even if principal prepayments do not occur   losses and shortfalls   the certificate balance or notional amount of any class of offered certificates may be reduced without distributions of principal as a result of the occurrence and allocation of realized losses reducing the maximum amount distributable in respect of principal on the offered certificates that are principal balance certificates as well as the amount of interest that would have otherwise been payable on the offered certificates in the absence of such reduction in general a realized loss occurs when the principal balance of a mortgage loan is reduced without an equal distribution to applicable certificateholders in reduction of the certificate balances of the certificates realized losses may occur in connection with a default on a mortgage loan acceptance of a discounted payoff the liquidation of the related mortgaged properties a reduction in the principal balance of a mortgage loan by a bankruptcy court or pursuant to a modification a recovery by the master servicer or trustee of a nonrecoverable advance on a distribution date or the incurrence of certain unanticipated or defaultrelated costs and expenses such as interest on advances workout fees liquidation fees and special servicing fees any reduction of the certificate balances of the classes of certificates indicated in the table below as a result of the application of realized losses will also reduce the notional amount of the related certificates           interestonly class of certificates   class notional amount    underlying class  class xa          class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb and class as certificates class xb            class b certificates   certificateholders are not entitled to receive distributions of periodic payments when due except to the extent they are either covered by a pi advance or actually received consequently any defaulted periodic payment for which no such pi advance is made will tend to extend the weighted average lives of the offered certificates whether or not a permitted extension of the due date of the related mortgage loan has been completed   certain relevant factors affecting loan payments and defaults   the rate and timing of principal payments and defaults and the severity of losses on the mortgage loans may be affected by a number of factors including without limitation the availability of credit for commercial or multifamily real estate prevailing interest rates the terms of the mortgage loans for example dueonsale clauses lockout periods or yield maintenance charges release of property provisions amortization terms that require balloon payments and incentives for a borrower to repay its mortgage loan by an anticipated repayment date the demographics and relative economic vitality of the areas in which the mortgaged properties are located and the general supply and demand for rental properties in those areas the quality of management of the mortgaged properties the servicing of the mortgage loans possible changes in tax laws and other opportunities for investment see “risk factors” and “description of the mortgage pool”        the rate of prepayment on the pool of mortgage loans is likely to be affected by prevailing market interest rates for mortgage loans of a comparable type term and risk level as the mortgage loans when the prevailing market interest rate is below a mortgage interest rate a borrower may have an increased incentive to refinance its mortgage loan although the mortgage loans contain provisions designed to mitigate the likelihood of an early loan repayment we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will refrain from prepaying their mortgage loans due to the existence of these provisions or that involuntary prepayments will not occur see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans”   with respect to certain mortgage loans the related mortgage loan documents allow for the sale of individual properties and the severance of the related debt and the assumption by the transferee of such portion of the mortgage loan asis allocable to the individual property acquired by that transferee subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions in addition with respect to certain mortgage loans the related mortgage loan documents allow for partial releases of individual mortgaged properties during a lockout period or during such time as a yield maintenance charge would otherwise be payable which could result in a prepayment of a portion of the initial principal balance of the related mortgage loan without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium additionally in the case of a partial release of an individual mortgaged property the related release amount in many cases is greater than the allocated loan amount for the mortgaged property being released which would result in a greater than proportionate paydown of the mortgage loan see “description of the mortgage pool—certain terms of the mortgage loans—partial releases”   depending on prevailing market interest rates the outlook for market interest rates and economic conditions generally some borrowers may sell mortgaged properties in order to realize their equity in the mortgaged property to meet cash flow needs or to make other investments in addition some borrowers may be motivated by federal and state tax laws which are subject to change to sell mortgaged properties prior to the exhaustion of tax depreciation benefits   we make no representation as to the particular factors that will affect the rate and timing of prepayments and defaults on the mortgage loans as to the relative importance of those factors as to the percentage of the principal balance of the mortgage loans that will be prepaid or as to which a default will have occurred as of any date or as to the overall rate of prepayment or default on the mortgage loans   delay in payment of distributions   because each monthly distribution is made on each distribution date which is at least  days after the end of the related interest accrual period for the certificates the effective yield to the holders of such certificates will be lower than the yield that would otherwise be produced by the applicable passthrough rates and purchase prices assuming the prices did not account for the delay   yield on the certificates with notional amounts   the yield to maturity of the certificates with notional amounts will be highly sensitive to the rate and timing of reductions made to the certificate balances of the classes of certificates indicated in the table below including by reason of prepayments and principal losses on the mortgage loans and other factors described above                interestonly class of certificates    class notional amount   underlying class           class xa          class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb and class as certificates           class xb            class b certificates   any optional termination by the holders of the controlling class the special servicer the master servicer or the holders of the class r certificates would result in prepayment in full of the offered certificates and would have an adverse effect on the yield of a class of the certificates with notional amounts because a termination would have an effect similar to a principal prepayment in full of the mortgage loans and as a result investors in these certificates and any other offered certificates purchased at premium might not fully recoup their initial investment see “pooling and servicing agreement—termination retirement of certificates”   investors in the certificates with notional amounts should fully consider the associated risks including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of prepayment or other liquidation of the mortgage loans could result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial investments   weighted average life   the weighted average life of a principal balance certificate refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of its issuance until each dollar to be applied in reduction of the aggregate certificate balance of those certificates is paid to the related investor the weighted average life of a principal balance certificate will be influenced by among other things the rate at which principal on the mortgage loans is paid or otherwise received which may be in the form of scheduled amortization voluntary prepayments insurance and condemnation proceeds and liquidation proceeds distributions among the various classes of certificates will be made as set forth under “description of the certificates—distributions—priority of distributions”   prepayments on mortgage loans may be measured by a prepayment standard or model the “constant prepayment rate” or “cpr” model represents an assumed constant annual rate of prepayment each month expressed as a per annum percentage of the thenscheduled principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans the “cpy” model represents an assumed cpr prepayment rate after any applicable lockout period any applicable period in which defeasance is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance period the depositor also may utilize the “cpp” model which represents an assumed cpr prepayment rate after any applicable lockout period any applicable period in which defeasance is permitted any applicable yield maintenance period and after any fixed penalty period the model used in this prospectus is the cpp model as used in each of the following tables the column headed “ cpp” assumes that none of the mortgage loans is prepaid before its maturity date or anticipated repayment date as the case may be the columns headed “ cpp” “ cpp” “ cpp” and “ cpp” assume that prepayments on the mortgage loans are made at those levels of cpp we cannot assure you however that prepayments of the mortgage loans will conform to any level of cpp and we make no representation that the mortgage loans will prepay at the levels of cpp shown or at any other prepayment rate        the following tables indicate the percentage of the initial certificate balance of each class of the principal balance certificates that would be outstanding after each of the dates shown at various cpps and the corresponding weighted average life of each class of offered certificates the tables have been prepared on the basis of the following assumptions the “structuring assumptions” among others   ○except as otherwise set forth below the mortgage loans have the characteristics set forth on annex a to this prospectus and the aggregate cutoff date balance of the mortgage loans is as described in this prospectus   ○the initial aggregate certificate balance or notional amount as the case may be of each interestbearing class of certificates is as described in this prospectus   ○the passthrough rate for each interestbearing class of certificates is as described in this prospectus   ○no delinquencies defaults or losses occur with respect to any of the mortgage loans   ○no additional trust fund expenses including operating advisor expenses arise no servicing advances are made under the psa and the only expenses of the issuing entity consist of the certificate administratortrustee fees the servicing fees the crefc® intellectual property royalty license fees the asset representations reviewer fees and the operating advisor fees each as set forth on annex a to this prospectus   ○there are no modifications extensions waivers or amendments affecting the monthly debt service payments by borrowers on the mortgage loans   ○each of the mortgage loans provides for monthly debt service payments to be due on the first day of each month regardless of the actual day of the month on which those payments are otherwise due and regardless of whether the subject date is a business day or not   ○all monthly debt service or balloon payments on the mortgage loans are timely received by a master servicer on behalf of the issuing entity on the day on which they are assumed to be due or paid as described in the immediately preceding bullet   ○each ard loan in the trust fund is paid in full on its anticipated repayment date   ○no involuntary prepayments are received as to any mortgage loan at any time including without limitation as a result of any application of escrows reserve or holdback amounts if performance criteria are not satisfied   ○except as described in the next two succeeding bullets no voluntary prepayments are received as to any mortgage loan during that mortgage loan’s prepayment lockout period any period when defeasance is permitted or during any period when principal prepayments on that mortgage loan are required to be accompanied by a prepayment premium or yield maintenance charge   ○except as otherwise assumed in the immediately preceding two bullets prepayments are made on each of the mortgage loans at the indicated cpps set forth in the subject tables or other relevant part of this prospectus without regard to any limitations in those mortgage loans on partial voluntary principal prepayments        ○ all prepayments on the mortgage loans are assumed to be accompanied by a full month’s interest and no prepayment interest shortfalls occur   ○ no yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums are collected   ○ no person or entity entitled thereto exercises its right of optional termination as described in this prospectus   ○ no mortgage loan is required to be repurchased   ○ distributions on the offered certificates are made on the th day of each month commencing in january  and   ○ the offered certificates are settled with investors on december     to the extent that the mortgage loans have characteristics that differ from those assumed in preparing the tables set forth below a class of principal balance certificates may mature earlier or later than indicated by the tables the tables set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and it is highly unlikely that the mortgage loans will actually prepay at any constant rate until maturity or that all the mortgage loans will prepay at the same rate in addition variations in the actual prepayment experience and the balance of the mortgage loans that prepay may increase or decrease the percentages of initial certificate balances and weighted average lives shown in the following tables these variations may occur even if the average prepayment experience of the mortgage loans were to equal any of the specified cpp percentages investors should not rely on the prepayment assumptions set forth in this prospectus and are urged to conduct their own analyses of the rates at which the mortgage loans may be expected to prepay based on their own assumptions based on the foregoing assumptions the following tables indicate the resulting weighted average lives of each class of offered certificates and set forth the percentage

tables indicate the approximate pretax yield to maturity on a corporate bond equivalent basis on the offered certificates for the specified cpps based on the assumptions set forth under “—weighted average life” above it was further assumed that the purchase price of the offered certificates is as specified in the tables below expressed as a percentage of the initial certificate balance or notional amount as applicable plus accrued interest from december   to the closing date   the yields set forth in the following tables were calculated by determining the monthly discount rates that when applied to the assumed streams of cash flows to be paid on the applicable class of offered certificates would cause the discounted present value of such assumed stream of cash flows to equal the assumed purchase price of such class plus accrued interest and by converting such monthly rates to semiannual corporate bond equivalent rates such calculations do not take into account shortfalls in collection of interest due to prepayments or other liquidations of the mortgage loans or the interest rates at which investors may be able to reinvest funds received by them as distributions on the applicable class of certificates and accordingly do not purport to reflect the return on any investment in the applicable class of offered certificates when such reinvestment rates are considered   the characteristics of the mortgage loans may differ from those assumed in preparing the tables below in addition we cannot assure you that the mortgage loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the rates shown in the tables or at any other particular rate that the cash flows on the applicable class of offered certificates will correspond to the cash flows shown in this prospectus or that the aggregate purchase price of such class of offered certificates will be as assumed in addition it is unlikely that the mortgage loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the specified cpps until maturity or that all the mortgage loans will so prepay at the same rate timing of changes in the rate of prepayments may significantly affect the actual yield to maturity to investors even if the average rate of principal prepayments is consistent with the expectations of investors investors must make their own decisions as to the appropriate prepayment assumption to be used in deciding whether to purchase any class of offered certificates        for purposes of this prospectus prepayment assumptions with respect to the mortgage loans are

                              material federal income tax considerations   general   the following is a general discussion of the anticipated material federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the certificates the discussion below does not purport to address all federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to particular categories of investors such as banks insurance companies securities dealers foreign persons investors whose functional currency is not the us dollar and investors that hold the certificates as part of a “straddle” or “conversion transaction” some of which may be subject to special rules the authorities on which this discussion is based are subject to change or differing interpretations and any such change or interpretation could apply retroactively this discussion reflects the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” as well as regulations the “remic regulations” promulgated by the us department of the treasury and the irs investors are encouraged to consult their tax advisors in determining the federal state local or any other tax consequences to them of the purchase ownership and disposition of the certificates   two separate real estate mortgage investment conduit “remic” elections will be made with respect to designated portions of the issuing entity the “lowertier remic” and the “uppertier remic” and together the “trust remics” the lowertier remic will hold the mortgage loans excluding excess interest and certain other assets and will issue i one or more classes of regular interests the “lowertier regular interests” to the uppertier remic and ii an uncertificated interest represented by the class r certificates as the sole class of “residual interests” in the lowertier remic   the uppertier remic will hold the lowertier regular interests and will issue i the class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb class xa class xb class xd class as class b class c class d class e class f and class g certificates the “regular interests” each representing a regular interest in the uppertier remic and ii an uncertificated interest represented by the class r certificates as the sole class of “residual interests” in the uppertier remic   qualification as a remic requires ongoing compliance with certain conditions assuming i the making of appropriate elections ii compliance with the psa and any other governing documents iii compliance with the provisions of any nonserviced psa and any amendments thereto and the continued qualification of the remics formed under any nonserviced psa and iv compliance with any changes in the law including any amendments to the code or applicable treasury regulations thereunder in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp special tax counsel to the depositor a each trust remic will qualify as a remic on the closing date and thereafter b each of the lowertier regular interests will constitute a “regular interest” in the lowertier remic c each of the regular interests will constitute a “regular interest” in the uppertier remic and d the class r certificates will evidence the sole class of “residual interests” in each trust remic   in addition in the opinion of cadwalader wickersham  taft llp special tax counsel to the depositor the excess interest and the related distribution account will be treated as a grantor trust the “grantor trust” for federal income tax purposes under subpart e part i of subchapter j of the code accordingly the class v certificates will represent undivided beneficial interests in the grantor trust         qualification as a remic   in order for each trust remic to qualify as a remic there must be ongoing compliance on the part of such trust remic with the requirements set forth in the code each trust remic must fulfill an asset test which requires that no more than a de minimis portion of the assets of such trust remic as of the close of the third calendar month beginning after the closing date which for purposes of this discussion is the date of the issuance of the regular interests the “startup day” and at all times thereafter may consist of assets other than “qualified mortgages” and “permitted investments” the remic regulations provide a safe harbor pursuant to which the de minimis requirements will be met if at all times the aggregate adjusted basis of the nonqualified assets is less than  of the aggregate adjusted basis of all such trust remic’s assets each trust remic also must provide “reasonable arrangements” to prevent its residual interest from being held by “disqualified organizations” or their agents and must furnish applicable tax information to transferors or agents that violate this restriction the psa will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in the class r certificates may be transferred or registered unless certain conditions designed to prevent violation of this restriction are met consequently it is expected that each trust remic will qualify as a remic at all times that any of its regular interests are outstanding   a qualified mortgage is any obligation that is principally secured by an interest in real property and that is either transferred to a remic on the startup day or is purchased by a remic within a  month period thereafter pursuant to a fixed price contract in effect on the startup day qualified mortgages include i whole mortgage loans or splitnote interests in such mortgage loans such as the mortgage loans provided that in general a the fair market value of the real property security including buildings and structural components of the real property security reduced by  the amount of any lien on the real property security that is senior to the mortgage loan and  a proportionate amount of any lien on the real property security that is in parity with the mortgage loan is at least  of the aggregate principal balance of such mortgage loan either at origination or as of the startup day a loantovalue ratio of not more than  with respect to the real property security or b substantially all the proceeds of the mortgage loan or the underlying mortgages were used to acquire improve or protect an interest in real property that at the date of origination was the only security for the mortgage loan and ii regular interests in another remic such as the lowertier regular interests that will be held by the uppertier remic if a mortgage loan was not in fact principally secured by real property or is otherwise not a qualified mortgage it must be disposed of within  days of discovery of such defect or otherwise ceases to be a qualified mortgage after such day period   permitted investments include “cash flow investments” “qualified reserve assets” and “foreclosure property” a cash flow investment is an investment earning a return in the nature of interest of amounts received on or with respect to qualified mortgages for a temporary period not exceeding  months until the next scheduled distribution to holders of interests in the remic a qualified reserve asset is any intangible property held for investment that is part of any reasonably required reserve maintained by the remic to provide for payments of expenses of the remic or amounts due on its regular or residual interests in the event of defaults including delinquencies on the qualified mortgages lower than expected reinvestment returns prepayment interest shortfalls and certain other contingencies the trust remics will not hold any qualified reserve assets foreclosure property is real property acquired by a remic in connection with the default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage and maintained by the remic in compliance with applicable rules and personal property that is incidental to such real property provided that the mortgage loan sellers had no knowledge or reason to know as of the startup day that such        a default had occurred or would occur foreclosure property may generally not be held after the close of the third calendar year beginning after the date the issuing entity acquires such property with one extension that may be granted by the irs   a mortgage loan held by a remic will fail to be a qualified mortgage if it is “significantly modified” unless default is “reasonably foreseeable” or where the servicer believes there is a “significant risk of default” upon maturity of the mortgage loan or at an earlier date and that by making such modification the risk of default is substantially reduced a mortgage loan held by a remic will not be considered to have been “significantly modified” following the release of the lien on a portion of the real property collateral if a the release is pursuant to a defeasance permitted under the mortgage loan documents that occurs more than two years after the startup day of the remic or b following the release the loantovalue ratio for the mortgage loan is not more than  with respect to the real property security furthermore if the release is not pursuant to a defeasance and following the release the loantovalue ratio for the mortgage loan is greater than  the mortgage loan will continue to be a qualified mortgage if the release is part of a “qualified paydown transaction” in accordance with revenue procedure    in addition to the foregoing requirements the various interests in a remic also must meet certain requirements all of the interests in a remic must be either of the following i one or more classes of regular interests or ii a single class of residual interests on which distributions if any are made pro rata a regular interest is an interest in a remic that is issued on the startup day with fixed terms is designated as a regular interest and unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount or other similar amount and provides that interest payments or other similar amounts if any at or before maturity either are payable based on a fixed rate or a qualified variable rate or consist of a specified nonvarying portion of the interest payments on the qualified mortgages the rate on the specified portion may be a fixed rate a variable rate or the difference between one fixed or qualified variable rate and another fixed or qualified variable rate the specified principal amount of a regular interest that provides for interest payments consisting of a specified nonvarying portion of interest payments on qualified mortgages may be zero an interest in a remic may be treated as a regular interest even if payments of principal with respect to such interest are subordinated to payments on other regular interests or the residual interest in the remic and are dependent on the absence of defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages or permitted investments lower than reasonably expected returns on permitted investments expenses incurred by the remic or prepayment interest shortfalls a residual interest is an interest in a remic other than a regular interest that is issued on the startup day that is designated as a residual interest accordingly each of the lowertier regular interests will constitute a class of regular interests in the lowertier remic each class of the regular interests will constitute a class of regular interests in the uppertier remic and the class r certificates will represent the sole class of residual interests in each trust remic   if an entity fails to comply with one or more of the ongoing requirements of the code for status as a remic during any taxable year the code provides that the entity or applicable portion of it will not be treated as a remic for such year and thereafter in this event any entity with debt obligations with two or more maturities such as the trust remics may be treated as a separate association taxable as a corporation under treasury regulations and the certificates may be treated as equity interests in such an association the code however authorizes the treasury department to issue regulations that address situations where failure to meet one or more of the requirements for remic status occurs inadvertently and in good faith investors should be aware however that the conference committee report to the tax reform act of  the “ act” indicates that the relief        may be accompanied by sanctions such as the imposition of a corporate tax on all or a portion of a remic’s income for the period of time in which the requirements for remic status are not satisfied   status of offered certificates   offered certificates held by a real estate investment trust will constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning of code section cb and interest including original issue discount on the offered certificates will be considered “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property” within the meaning of code section cb in the same proportion that for both purposes the assets of the issuing entity would be so treated if at all times  or more of the assets of the issuing entity qualify for each of the foregoing treatments the offered certificates will qualify for the corresponding status in their entirety for the purposes of the foregoing determinations the trust remics will be treated as a single remic for purposes of code section cb payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans that are reinvested pending distribution to holders of offered certificates qualify for such treatment offered certificates held by a domestic building and loan association will be treated as “loans    secured by an interest in real property which is    residential real property” within the meaning of code section acv or as other assets described in code section ac only to the extent the mortgage loans are secured by residential real property as of the cutoff date  of the mortgaged properties securing  mortgage loans representing  of the initial pool balance are multifamily properties holders of offered certificates should consult their tax advisors whether the foregoing percentage or some other percentage applies to their offered certificates in addition mortgage loans that have been defeased with government securities will not qualify for such treatment offered certificates will be “qualified mortgages” within the meaning of code section ga for another remic if transferred to that remic within a prescribed time period in exchange for regular or residual interests in that remic moreover offered certificates held by certain financial institutions will constitute an “evidence of indebtedness” within the meaning of code section c   taxation of regular interests   general   each class of regular interests whether held directly or indirectly represents one or more regular interests in the uppertier remic the regular interests will represent newly originated debt instruments for federal income tax purposes in general interest original issue discount and market discount on a regular interest will be treated as ordinary income to the holder of a regular interest a “regular interestholder” and principal payments on a regular interest will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the regular interestholder’s basis in the regular interest regular interestholders must use the accrual method of accounting with regard to the regular interests regardless of the method of accounting otherwise used by such regular interestholders   original issue discount   holders of regular interests issued with original issue discount generally must include original issue discount in ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with the constant yield method which takes into account the compounding of interest in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to such income the following discussion is based in part on temporary and final treasury regulations the “oid        regulations” under code sections  through  and  and in part on the provisions of the  act regular interestholders should be aware however that the oid regulations do not adequately address certain issues relevant to prepayable securities such as the regular interests to the extent such issues are not addressed in the oid regulations the certificate administrator will apply the methodology described in the conference committee report to the  act no assurance can be provided that the irs will not take a different position as to those matters not currently addressed by the oid regulations moreover the oid regulations include an antiabuse rule allowing the irs to apply or depart from the oid regulations if necessary or appropriate to ensure a reasonable tax result in light of the applicable statutory provisions a tax result will not be considered unreasonable under the antiabuse rule however in the absence of a substantial effect on the present value of a taxpayer’s tax liability investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the discussion in this prospectus and the appropriate method for reporting interest and original issue discount with respect to the regular interests   each regular interest will be treated as an installment obligation for purposes of determining the original issue discount includible in a regular interestholder’s income the total amount of original issue discount on a regular interest is the excess of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of the regular interest over its “issue price” the issue price of a class of regular interests is the first price at which a substantial amount of regular interests of such class is sold to investors excluding bond houses brokers and underwriters although unclear under the oid regulations the certificate administrator will treat the issue price of regular interests for which there is no substantial sale as of the issue date as the fair market value of such regular interests as of the issue date the issue price of the regular interests also includes the amount paid by an initial regular interestholder for accrued interest that relates to a period prior to the issue date of such class of regular interests the stated redemption price at maturity of a regular interest is the sum of all payments provided by the debt instrument other than any qualified stated interest payments under the oid regulations qualified stated interest generally means interest payable at a single fixed rate or a qualified variable rate provided that such interest payments are unconditionally payable at intervals of one year or less during the entire term of the obligation because there is no penalty or default remedy in the case of nonpayment of interest with respect to a regular interest it is possible that no interest on any class of regular interests will be treated as qualified stated interest however because the mortgage loans provide for remedies in the event of default the certificate administrator will treat all payments of stated interest on the regular interests other than the class x certificates as qualified stated interest other than accrued interest distributed on the first distribution date for the number of days that exceed the interval between the closing date and the first distribution date   it is anticipated that the certificate administrator will treat the class xa and class xb certificates as having no qualified stated interest accordingly such classes will be considered to be issued with original issue discount in an amount equal to the excess of all distributions of interest expected to be received on such classes over their respective issue prices including interest accrued prior to the closing date any “negative” amounts of original issue discount on such classes attributable to rapid prepayments with respect to the mortgage loans will not be deductible currently the holder of a class xa or class xb certificate may be entitled to a deduction for a loss which may be a capital loss to the extent it becomes certain that such holder will not recover a portion of its basis in such class assuming no further prepayments in the alternative it is possible that rules similar to the “noncontingent bond method” of the contingent interest rules of the oid regulations may be promulgated with respect to such classes unless and until required otherwise by applicable authority it is not anticipated that the contingent interest rules will apply         under a de minimis rule original issue discount on a regular interest will be considered to be zero if such original issue discount is less than  of the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular interest multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the regular interest for this purpose the weighted average maturity of the regular interest is computed as the sum of the amounts determined by multiplying the number of full years ie rounding down partial years from the issue date until each distribution in reduction of stated redemption price at maturity is scheduled to be made by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of each distribution included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular interest and the denominator of which is the stated redemption price at maturity or anticipated repayment date of the regular interest the conference committee report to the  act provides that the schedule of such distributions should be determined in accordance with the assumed rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans used in pricing the transaction provided that it is assumed that any ard loan prepays on its anticipated repayment date the “prepayment assumption” see “yield and maturity considerations—weighted average life” above holders generally must report de minimis original issue discount pro rata as principal payments are received and such income will be capital gain if the regular interest is held as a capital asset under the oid regulations however regular interestholders may elect to accrue all de minimis original issue discount as well as market discount and premium under the constant yield method see “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below based on the foregoing it is anticipated that the class c certificates will be issued with de minimis original issue discount for federal income tax purposes   a holder of a regular interest issued with original issue discount generally must include in gross income for any taxable year the sum of the “daily portions” as defined below of the original issue discount on the regular interest accrued during an accrual period for each day on which it holds the regular interest including the date of purchase but excluding the date of disposition with respect to each such regular interest a calculation will be made of the original issue discount that accrues during each successive full accrual period that ends on the day prior to each distribution date with respect to the regular interests assuming that prepayments and extensions with respect to the mortgage loans will be made in accordance with the prepayment assumption the original issue discount accruing in a full accrual period will be the excess if any of i the sum of a the present value of all of the remaining distributions to be made on the regular interest as of the end of that accrual period and b the distributions made on the regular interest during the accrual period that are included in the regular interest’s stated redemption price at maturity over ii the adjusted issue price of the regular interest at the beginning of the accrual period the present value of the remaining distributions referred to in the preceding sentence is calculated based on i the yield to maturity of the regular interest as of the startup day ii events including actual prepayments that have occurred prior to the end of the accrual period and iii the assumption that the remaining payments will be made in accordance with the original prepayment assumption for these purposes the adjusted issue price of a regular interest at the beginning of any accrual period equals the issue price of the regular interest increased by the aggregate amount of original issue discount with respect to the regular interest that accrued in all prior accrual periods and reduced by the amount of distributions included in the regular interest’s stated redemption price at maturity that were made on the regular interest that were attributable to such prior periods the original issue discount accruing during any accrual period as determined in this paragraph will then be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original issue discount for each day in the period   under the method described above the daily portions of original issue discount required to be included as ordinary income by a regular interestholder other than a holder of a         class xa or class xb certificate generally will increase to take into account prepayments on the regular interests as a result of prepayments on the mortgage loans that exceed the prepayment assumption and generally will decrease but not below zero for any period if the prepayments are slower than the prepayment assumption due to the unique nature of interestonly certificates the preceding sentence may not apply in the case of the class xa or class xb certificates   acquisition premium   a purchaser of a regular interest at a price greater than its adjusted issue price and less than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity will be required to include in gross income the daily portions of the original issue discount on the regular interest reduced pro rata by a fraction the numerator of which is the excess of its purchase price over such adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the excess of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity over the adjusted issue price alternatively such a purchaser may elect to treat all such acquisition premium under the constant yield method as described under the heading “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below   market discount   a purchaser of a regular interest also may be subject to the market discount rules of code sections  through  under these code sections and the principles applied by the oid regulations in the context of original issue discount “market discount” is the amount by which the purchaser’s original basis in the regular interest i is exceeded by the remaining outstanding principal payments and nonqualified stated interest payments due on the regular interest or ii in the case of a regular interest having original issue discount is exceeded by the adjusted issue price of such regular interest at the time of purchase such purchaser generally will be required to recognize ordinary income to the extent of accrued market discount on such regular interest as distributions includible in its stated redemption price at maturity are received in an amount not exceeding any such distribution such market discount would accrue in a manner to be provided in treasury regulations and should take into account the prepayment assumption the conference committee report to the  act provides that until such regulations are issued such market discount would accrue at the election of the holder either i on the basis of a constant interest rate or ii in the ratio of interest accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the interest accrued for such period plus the remaining interest after the end of such period or in the case of classes issued with original issue discount in the ratio of original issue discount accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the original issue discount accrued for such period plus the remaining original issue discount after the end of such period such purchaser also generally will be required to treat a portion of any gain on a sale or exchange of the regular interest as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued to the date of disposition under one of the foregoing methods less any accrued market discount previously reported as ordinary income as partial distributions in reduction of the stated redemption price at maturity were received such purchaser will be required to defer deduction of a portion of the excess of the interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry the regular interest over the interest including original issue discount distributable on the regular interest the deferred portion of such interest expense in any taxable year generally will not exceed the accrued market discount on the regular interest for such year any such deferred interest expense is in general allowed as a deduction not later than the year in which the related market discount income is recognized or the regular interest is disposed of as an alternative to the inclusion of market discount in income on the foregoing basis the regular interestholder may elect to        include market discount in income currently as it accrues on all market discount instruments acquired by such regular interestholder in that taxable year or thereafter in which case the interest deferral rule will not apply see “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below regarding making the election under code section  and an alternative manner in which such election may be deemed to be made   market discount with respect to a regular interest will be considered to be zero if such market discount is less than  of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity of such regular interest multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the regular interest remaining after the date of purchase for this purpose the weighted average maturity is determined by multiplying the number of full years ie rounding down partial years from the issue date until each distribution in reduction of stated redemption price at maturity is scheduled to be made by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of each such distribution included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular interest and the denominator of which is the total stated redemption price at maturity of the regular interest it appears that de minimis market discount would be reported pro rata as principal payments are received treasury regulations implementing the market discount rules have not yet been proposed and investors should therefore consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules as well as the advisability of making any of the elections with respect to such rules investors should also consult revenue procedure  concerning the elections to include market discount in income currently and to accrue market discount on the basis of the constant yield method   premium   a regular interest purchased upon initial issuance or in the secondary market at a cost greater than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium if the regular interestholder holds such regular interest as a “capital asset” within the meaning of code section  the regular interestholder may elect under code section  to amortize such premium under the constant yield method see “—election to treat all interest under the constant yield method” below regarding making the election under code section  and an alternative manner in which the code section  election may be deemed to be made final treasury regulations under code section  do not by their terms apply to prepayable obligations such as the regular interests the conference committee report to the  act indicates a congressional intent that the same rules that will apply to the accrual of market discount on installment obligations will also apply to amortizing bond premium under code section  on installment obligations such as the regular interests although it is unclear whether the alternatives to the constant interest method described above under “—market discount” are available amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on a regular interest rather than as a separate deduction item it is anticipated that the class a class aa class ab class a class a class asb class as and class b certificates will be issued at a premium for federal income tax purposes   election to treat all interest under the constant yield method   a holder of a debt instrument such as a regular interest may elect to treat all interest that accrues on the instrument using the constant yield method with none of the interest being treated as qualified stated interest for purposes of applying the constant yield method to a debt instrument subject to such an election i ”interest” includes stated interest original issue discount de minimis original issue discount market discount and de minimis market discount as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium and ii the debt instrument is treated as if the instrument were issued on the        holder’s acquisition date in the amount of the holder’s adjusted basis immediately after acquisition it is unclear whether for this purpose the initial prepayment assumption would continue to apply or if a new prepayment assumption as of the date of the holder’s acquisition would apply a holder generally may make such an election on an instrument by instrument basis or for a class or group of debt instruments however if the holder makes such an election with respect to a debt instrument with amortizable bond premium or with market discount the holder is deemed to have made elections to amortize bond premium or to report market discount income currently as it accrues under the constant yield method respectively for all premium bonds held or acquired or market discount bonds acquired by the holder on the first day of the year of the election or thereafter the election is made on the holder’s federal income tax return for the year in which the debt instrument is acquired and is irrevocable except with the approval of the irs investors are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the advisability of making such an election   treatment of losses   holders of the regular interests will be required to report income with respect to the regular interests on the accrual method of accounting without giving effect to delays or reductions in distributions attributable to defaults or delinquencies on the mortgage loans except to the extent it can be established that such losses are uncollectible accordingly a regular interestholder may have income or may incur a diminution in cash flow as a result of a default or delinquency but may not be able to take a deduction subject to the discussion below for the corresponding loss until a subsequent taxable year in this regard investors are cautioned that while they generally may cease to accrue interest income if it reasonably appears that the interest will be uncollectible the irs may take the position that original issue discount must continue to be accrued in spite of its uncollectibility until the debt instrument is disposed of in a taxable transaction or becomes worthless in accordance with the rules of code section  the following discussion may not apply to holders of interestonly regular interests under code section  it appears that the holders of regular interests that are corporations or that otherwise hold the regular interests in connection with a trade or business should in general be allowed to deduct as an ordinary loss any such loss sustained and not previously deducted during the taxable year on account of any such regular interests becoming wholly or partially worthless and that in general the regular interestholders that are not corporations and do not hold the regular interests in connection with a trade or business will be allowed to deduct as a short term capital loss any loss with respect to principal sustained during the taxable year on account of a portion of any class of such regular interests becoming wholly worthless although the matter is not free from doubt such noncorporate holders of regular interests should be allowed a bad debt deduction at such time as the certificate balance of any class of such regular interests is reduced to reflect losses on the mortgage loans below such holder’s basis in the regular interests the irs however could take the position that noncorporate holders will be allowed a bad debt deduction to reflect such losses only after the classes of regular interests have been otherwise retired the irs could also assert that losses on a class of regular interests are deductible based on some other method that may defer such deductions for all holders such as reducing future cash flow for purposes of computing original issue discount this may have the effect of creating “negative” original issue discount that with the possible exception of the method discussed in the following sentence would be deductible only against future positive original issue discount or otherwise upon termination of the applicable class although not free from doubt a holder of regular interests with negative original issue discount may be entitled to deduct a loss to the extent that its remaining basis would exceed the maximum amount of future payments to which such holder was entitled assuming no further prepayments no bad debt losses will be allowed with respect to the classes of interestonly regular interests such as the        class x certificates regular interestholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the appropriate timing amount and character of any loss sustained with respect to such regular interests special loss rules are applicable to banks and thrift institutions including rules regarding reserves for bad debts such taxpayers are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the treatment of losses on the regular interests   yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums   yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums actually collected on the mortgage loans will be distributed as described in “description of the certificates—allocation of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums” it is not entirely clear under the code when the amount of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums so allocated should be taxed to the holders of such classes of certificates but it is not expected for federal income tax reporting purposes that yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums will be treated as giving rise to any income to the holder of such class of certificates prior to the certificate administrator’s actual receipt of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums if any may be treated as paid upon the retirement or partial retirement of such classes of certificates the irs may disagree with these positions certificateholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the treatment of yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums   sale or exchange of regular interests   if a regular interestholder sells or exchanges a regular interest such regular interestholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference if any between the amount received and its adjusted basis in the regular interest the adjusted basis of a regular interest generally will equal the cost of the regular interest to the seller increased by any original issue discount or market discount previously included in the seller’s gross income with respect to the regular interest and reduced by amounts included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the regular interest that were previously received by the seller by any amortized premium and by any deductible losses on the regular interest   except as described above with respect to market discount and except as provided in this paragraph any gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a regular interest realized by an investor that holds the regular interest as a capital asset will be capital gain or loss and will be long term or short term depending on whether the regular interest has been held for the long term capital gain holding period more than one year such gain will be treated as ordinary income i if the regular interest is held as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in code section c up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the regular interestholder’s net investment in the conversion transaction at  of the appropriate applicable federal rate under code section d in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property that was held as part of such transaction ii in the case of a noncorporate taxpayer to the extent such taxpayer has made an election under code section d to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary income rates or iii to the extent that such gain does not exceed the excess if any of a the amount that would have been includible in the gross income of the regular interestholder if his yield on such regular interest were  of the applicable federal rate as of the date of purchase over b the amount of income actually includible in the gross income of such regular interestholder with respect to the regular interest in addition gain or loss recognized from the sale of a regular interest by certain banks or thrift institutions will be treated as ordinary income or loss pursuant to code        section c longterm capital gains of certain noncorporate taxpayers generally are subject to a lower maximum tax rate than ordinary income of such taxpayers for property held for more than one year the maximum tax rate for corporations is the same with respect to both ordinary income and capital gains   taxes that may be imposed on a remic   prohibited transactions   income from certain transactions by any trust remic called prohibited transactions will not be part of the calculation of income or loss includible in the federal income tax returns of holders of the class r certificates but rather will be taxed directly to the trust remic at a  rate prohibited transactions generally include i the disposition of a qualified mortgage other than for a substitution within two years of the startup day for a defective including a defaulted obligation or repurchase in lieu of substitution of a defective including a defaulted obligation at any time or for any qualified mortgage within  months of the startup day b foreclosure default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage c bankruptcy or insolvency of the remic or d a qualified complete liquidation ii the receipt of income from assets that are not the type of mortgages or investments that the remic is permitted to hold iii the receipt of compensation for services or iv the receipt of gain from disposition of cash flow investments other than pursuant to a qualified liquidation notwithstanding i and iv it is not a prohibited transaction to sell remic property to prevent a default on regular interests as a result of a default on qualified mortgages or to facilitate a qualified liquidation or a cleanup call the remic regulations indicate that the modification of a mortgage loan generally will not be treated as a disposition if it is occasioned by a default or reasonably foreseeable default an assumption of a mortgage loan or the waiver of a “dueonsale” or “dueonencumbrance” clause it is not anticipated that the trust remics will engage in any prohibited transactions   contributions to a remic after the startup day   in general a remic will be subject to a tax at a  rate on the value of any property contributed to the remic after the startup day exceptions are provided for cash contributions to the remic i during the  months following the startup day ii made to a qualified reserve fund by a holder of a class r certificate iii in the nature of a guarantee iv made to facilitate a qualified liquidation or cleanup call and v as otherwise permitted in treasury regulations yet to be issued it is not anticipated that there will be any taxable contributions to the trust remics   net income from foreclosure property   the lowertier remic will be subject to federal income tax at the highest corporate rate on “net income from foreclosure property” determined by reference to the rules applicable to real estate investment trusts generally property acquired by foreclosure or deedinlieu of foreclosure would be treated as “foreclosure property” until the close of the third calendar year beginning after the lowertier remic’s acquisition of a reo property with a possible extension net income from foreclosure property generally means gain from the sale of a foreclosure property that is inventory property and gross income from foreclosure property other than qualifying rents and other qualifying income for a real estate investment trust   in order for a foreclosed property to qualify as foreclosure property any operation of the foreclosed property by the lowertier remic generally must be conducted through an independent contractor further such operation even if conducted through an independent contractor may give rise to “net income from foreclosure property” taxable at the highest        corporate rate payment of such tax by the lowertier remic would reduce amounts available for distribution to certificateholders   the special servicer will be required to determine generally whether the operation of foreclosed property in a manner that would subject the lowertier remic to such tax would be expected to result in higher aftertax proceeds than an alternative method of operating such property that would not subject the lowertier remic to such tax   bipartisan budget act of    on november   president obama signed into law the bipartisan budget act of  the “ budget act” which includes new audit rules affecting entities treated as partnerships their partners and the persons that are authorized to represent entities treated as partnerships in irs audits and related procedures under the  budget act these rules will also apply to remics the holders of their residual interests and the trustees authorized to represent remics in irs audits and related procedures “tax matters persons” or “tmps” these new audit rules are scheduled to become effective for taxable years beginning with  and will apply to both new and existing remics   in addition to other changes under the  budget act  unless a remic elects otherwise taxes arising from irs audit adjustments are required to be paid by the remic rather than by its residual interest holders  a remic appoints one person to act as its sole representative in connection with irs audits and related procedures and that representative’s actions including agreeing to adjustments to remic taxable income will be binding on residual interest holders more so than a tax matters person’s actions under the current rules and  if the irs makes an adjustment to a remic’s taxable year the holders of residual interests for the audited taxable year may have to take the adjustment into account for the taxable year in which the adjustment is made rather than for the audited taxable year   the certificate administrator will have the authority to utilize and will be directed to utilize any exceptions available under the new provisions including any changes and irs regulations so that holders of the class r certificates to the fullest extent possible rather than either trust remic itself will be liable for any taxes arising from audit adjustments to either trust remic’s taxable income it is unclear how any such exceptions may affect the procedural rules available to challenge any audit adjustment that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such exceptions investors should discuss with their own tax advisors the possible effect of the new rules on them   taxation of certain foreign investors   interest including original issue discount distributable to the regular interestholders that are nonresident aliens foreign corporations or other nonus persons will be considered “portfolio interest” and therefore generally will not be subject to a  united states withholding tax provided that such nonus person i is not a “ percent shareholder” within the meaning of

  general   the employee retirement income security act of  as amended or erisa and code section  impose certain requirements on retirement plans and on certain other employee benefit plans and arrangements including individual retirement accounts and annuities keogh plans collective investment funds insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts in which those plans accounts or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa or code section  all of which are referred to as “plans” and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to plans in connection with the investment of plan assets certain employee benefit plans such as governmental plans as defined in erisa section  and if no election has been made under code section d church plans as defined in section  of erisa are not subject to erisa requirements however those plans may be subject to the provisions of other applicable federal state or local law “similar law” materially similar to the foregoing provisions of erisa or the code moreover those plans if qualified and exempt from taxation under code sections a and a are subject to the prohibited transaction rules set forth in code section    erisa generally imposes on plan fiduciaries certain general fiduciary requirements including those of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that a plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan in addition erisa and the code prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons “parties in interest” who have certain specified relationships to the plan unless a statutory regulatory or administrative exemption is available certain parties in interest that participate in a prohibited transaction may be subject to an excise tax imposed pursuant to code section  unless a statutory regulatory or administrative exemption is available these prohibited transactions generally are set forth in section  of erisa and code section  special caution should be exercised before the assets of a plan are used to purchase an offered certificate if with respect to those assets the depositor any servicer or the trustee or any of their affiliates either a has investment discretion with respect to the investment of those assets of that plan or b has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment advice with respect to those assets for a fee and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to those assets and that the advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the plan or c is an employer maintaining or contributing to the plan   before purchasing any offered certificates with plan assets a plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel and determine whether there exists any prohibition to that purchase under the requirements of erisa or code section  whether any prohibited transaction class exemption or any individual administrative prohibited transaction exemption as described below applies including whether the appropriate conditions set forth in those exemptions would be met or whether any statutory prohibited transaction exemption is applicable fiduciaries of plans subject to a similar law should consider the need for and the availability of an exemption under such applicable similar law   plan asset regulations   a plan’s investment in offered certificates may cause the assets of the issuing entity to be deemed plan assets section  of the regulations of the united states department of labor “dol” as modified by section  of erisa provides that when a plan acquires an equity interest in an entity the plan’s assets include both the equity        interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless certain exceptions not applicable to this discussion apply or unless the equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” that is plans and entities whose underlying assets include plan assets is not “significant” for this purpose in general equity participation in an entity will be “significant” on any date if immediately after the most recent acquisition of any certificate  or more of any class of certificates is held by benefit plan investors   in general any person who has discretionary authority or control respecting the management or disposition of plan assets and any person who provides investment advice with respect to those assets for a fee is a fiduciary of the investing plan if the assets of the issuing entity constitute plan assets then any party exercising management or discretionary control regarding those assets such as a master servicer a special servicer or any subservicer may be deemed to be a plan “fiduciary” with respect to the investing plan and thus subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions and prohibited transaction provisions of erisa and code section  in addition if the assets of the issuing entity constitute plan assets the purchase of offered certificates by a plan as well as the operation of the issuing entity may constitute or involve a prohibited transaction under erisa or the code   administrative exemptions   the us department of labor has issued to the predecessor of

on prohibited transactions pursuant to code sections a and b certain transactions among others relating to the servicing and operation of pools of mortgage loans such as the pool of mortgage loans held by the issuing entity and the purchase sale and holding of mortgage passthrough certificates such as the offered certificates underwritten by wells fargo securities llc provided that certain conditions set forth in the exemption are satisfied the depositor expects that the exemption generally will apply to the offered certificates   the exemption sets forth  general conditions that must be satisfied for a transaction involving the purchase sale and holding of the offered certificates to be eligible for exemptive relief first the acquisition of the offered certificates by a plan must be on terms including the price paid for the offered certificates that are at least as favorable to the plan as they would be in an arm’slength transaction with an unrelated party second the offered certificates at the time of acquisition by the plan must be rated in one of the four highest generic rating categories by at least one nrsro that meets the requirements of the exemption an “exemption rating agency” third the trustee cannot be an affiliate of any other member of the restricted group other than an underwriter the “restricted group” consists of any underwriter the depositor the trustee the master servicer the special servicer any subservicer any entity that provides insurance or other credit support to the issuing entity and any borrower with respect to mortgage loans constituting more than  of the aggregate unamortized principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the date of initial issuance of the offered certificates and any affiliate of any of the foregoing entities fourth the sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters must represent not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting the offered certificates the sum of all payments made to and retained by the depositor pursuant to the assignment of the mortgage loans to the issuing entity must represent not more than the fair market value of        the mortgage loans and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the master servicer the special servicer and any subservicer must represent not more than reasonable compensation for that person’s services under the psa and reimbursement of the person’s reasonable expenses in connection therewith fifth the investing plan must be an accredited investor as defined in rule a of regulation d under the securities act   it is a condition of the issuance of the offered certificates that they have the ratings described above required by the exemption and the depositor believes that each of the rating agencies qualifies as an exemption rating agency consequently the second general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the offered certificates as of the closing date as of the closing date the third general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the offered certificates in addition the depositor believes that the fourth general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the offered certificates a fiduciary of a plan contemplating purchasing an offered certificate in the secondary market must make its own determination that at the time of purchase the offered certificates continue to satisfy the second general condition set forth above a fiduciary of a plan contemplating purchasing an offered certificate whether in the initial issuance of the offered certificates or in the secondary market must make its own determination that the first and fifth general conditions set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the related offered certificate   the exemption also requires that the issuing entity meet the following requirements  the issuing entity must consist solely of assets of the type that have been included in other investment pools  certificates in those other investment pools must have been rated in one of the four highest categories by at least one of the exemption rating agencies for at least one year prior to the plan’s acquisition of offered certificates and  certificates in those other investment pools must have been purchased by investors other than plans for at least one year prior to any plan’s acquisition of offered certificates   the depositor believes that the conditions to the applicability of the exemption will generally be met with respect to the offered certificates other than those conditions which are dependent on facts unknown to the depositor or which it cannot control such as those relating to the circumstances of the plan purchaser or the plan fiduciary making the decision to purchase any such offered certificates   if the general conditions of the exemption are satisfied the exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by sections a and a of erisa as well as the excise taxes imposed by code sections a and b by reason of code sections ca through d in connection with  the direct or indirect sale exchange or transfer of offered certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and a plan when the depositor any of the underwriters the trustee the master servicer the special servicer a subservicer or a borrower is a party in interest with respect to the investing plan  the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary market of the offered certificates by an plan and  the holding of offered certificates by a plan however no exemption is provided from the restrictions of sections ae a and  of erisa for the acquisition or holding of an offered certificate on behalf of an “excluded plan” by any person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of the excluded plan for purposes of this prospectus an “excluded plan” is a plan sponsored by any member of the restricted group   if certain specific conditions of the exemption are also satisfied the exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by sections b and b of erisa and the taxes imposed by code section ce in connection with  the        direct or indirect sale exchange or transfer of offered certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and a plan when the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the investment of plan assets in those certificates is a a borrower with respect to  or less of the fair market value of the mortgage loans or b an affiliate of that person  the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary market of offered certificates by a plan and  the holding of offered certificates by a plan   further if certain specific conditions of the exemption are satisfied the exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by sections a b and a of erisa and the taxes imposed by code sections a and b by reason of code section c for transactions in connection with the servicing management and operation of the pool of mortgage loans   a fiduciary of a plan should consult with its counsel with respect to the applicability of the exemption the fiduciary of a plan not subject to erisa or code section  such as a governmental plan should determine the need for and availability of exemptive relief under applicable similar law a purchaser of an offered certificate should be aware however that even if the conditions specified in one or more exemptions are satisfied the scope of relief provided by an exemption may not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions   insurance company general accounts   sections i and iii of prohibited transaction class exemption “ptce”  exempt from the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of sections a b and a of erisa and code section  transactions in connection with the acquisition of a security such as a certificate issued by the issuing entity as well as the servicing management and operation of a trust such as the issuing entity in which an insurance company general account has an interest as a result of its acquisition of certificates issued by the issuing entity provided that certain conditions are satisfied if these conditions are met insurance company general accounts investing assets that are treated as assets of plans would be allowed to purchase certain classes of certificates which do not meet the ratings requirements of the exemption all other conditions of the exemption would have to be satisfied in order for ptce  to be available before purchasing any class of offered certificates an insurance company general account seeking to rely on sections i and iii of ptce  should itself confirm that all applicable conditions and other requirements have been satisfied   section c of erisa provides certain exemptive relief from the provisions of part  of title i of erisa and code section  including the prohibited transaction restrictions imposed by erisa and the related excise taxes imposed by the code for transactions involving an insurance company general account pursuant to section c of erisa the dol issued regulations “c regulations” generally effective july   to provide guidance for the purpose of determining in cases where insurance policies supported by an insured’s general account are issued to or for the benefit of a plan on or before december   which general account assets constitute plan assets any assets of an insurance company general account which support insurance policies issued to a plan after december   or issued to plans on or before december   for which the insurance company does not comply with the c regulations may be treated as plan assets in addition because section c of erisa does not relate to insurance company separate accounts separate account assets are still generally treated as plan assets of any plan invested in that separate account insurance companies contemplating the investment        of general account assets in the offered certificates should consult with their counsel with respect to the applicability of section c of erisa   due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties imposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions it is particularly important that potential investors who are plan fiduciaries or who are investing plan assets consult with their counsel regarding the consequences under erisa and the code of their acquisition and ownership of certificates   the sale of offered certificates to a plan is in no respect a representation by the depositor or any of the underwriters that this investment meets any relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or any particular plan or that this investment is appropriate for plans generally or any particular plan   legal investment   none of the classes of offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended “smmea” generally the only classes of offered certificates which will qualify as “mortgage related securities” will be those that  are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one nrsro and  are part of a series evidencing interests in a trust consisting of loans originated by certain types of originators specified in smmea and secured by first liens on real estate   although section e of the doddfrank act amended smmea effective july   so as to require the sec to establish creditworthiness standards by that date in substitution for the foregoing ratings test the sec has neither proposed nor adopted a rule establishing new creditworthiness standards for purposes of smmea as of the date of this prospectus however the sec has issued a transitional interpretation release no  effective july   which provides that until such time as final rules establishing new standards of creditworthiness become effective the standard of creditworthiness for purposes of the definition of the term “mortgage related security” is a security that is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one nrsro depending on the standards of creditworthiness that are ultimately established by the sec it is possible that certain classes of offered certificates specified to be “mortgage related securities” for purposes of smmea may no longer qualify as such as of the time such new standards are effective   the appropriate characterization of the offered certificates under various legal investment restrictions and thus the ability of investors subject to those restrictions to purchase the offered certificates are subject to significant interpretive uncertainties we make no representation as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment financial institution regulatory or other purposes or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any offered certificates under applicable legal investment restrictions further any ratings downgrade of a class of offered certificates by an nrsro to less than an “investment grade” rating ie lower than the top four rating categories may adversely affect the ability of an investor to purchase or retain or otherwise impact the regulatory characteristics of that class the uncertainties described above and any unfavorable future determinations concerning the legal investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates may adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the offered certificates        accordingly if your investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities you should consult with your own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the offered certificates constitute legal investments or are subject to investment capital or other regulatory restrictions   the issuing entity will not be registered under the investment company act of  as amended the issuing entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of “investment company” under the investment company act of  as amended contained in section c of the investment company act of  as amended or rule a under the investment company act of  as amended although there may be additional exclusions or exemptions available to the issuing entity the issuing entity is being structured so as not to constitute a “covered fund” for purposes of the volcker rule under the doddfrank act   legal matters   the validity of the offered certificates and certain federal income tax matters will be passed upon for the depositor by cadwalader wickersham  taft llp charlotte north carolina and certain other legal matters will be passed upon for the underwriters by orrick herrington  sutcliffe llp new york new york   ratings   it is a condition to their issuance that the offered certificates receive investment grade credit ratings from each of the three  rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates   we are not obligated to maintain any particular rating with respect to any class of offered certificates changes affecting the mortgaged properties the parties to the psa or another person may have an adverse effect on the ratings of the offered certificates and thus on the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates although such adverse changes would not necessarily be an event of default under the related mortgage loan   the ratings address the likelihood of full and timely receipt by the certificateholders of all distributions of interest at the applicable passthrough rate on the offered certificates to which they are entitled on each distribution date and the ultimate payment in full of the certificate balance of each class of offered certificates on a date that it not later than the rated final distribution date with respect to such class of certificates the rated final distribution date will be the distribution date in december  see “yield and maturity considerations” and “pooling and servicing agreement—advances” any ratings of each offered certificates should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities   the ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities a measure of asset value or an indication of the suitability of an investment and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by any rating agency in addition these ratings do not address a the likelihood timing or frequency of prepayments both voluntary and involuntary and their impact on interest payments or the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated b the possibility that a certificateholder might suffer a lower than anticipated yield c the likelihood of receipt of yield maintenance charges prepayment charges prepayment premiums prepayment fees or penalties        default interest or postanticipated repayment date additional interest d the likelihood of experiencing any prepayment interest shortfalls an assessment of whether or to what extent the interest payable on any class of offered certificates may be reduced in connection with any prepayment interest shortfalls or of receiving compensating interest payments e the tax treatment of the offered certificates or effect of taxes on the payments received f the likelihood or willingness of the parties to the respective documents to meet their contractual obligations or the likelihood or willingness of any party or court to enforce or hold enforceable the documents in whole or in part g an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience h the likelihood timing or receipt of any payments of interest to the holders of the offered certificates resulting from an increase in the interest rate on any mortgage loan in connection with a mortgage loan modification waiver or amendment i excess interest or j other noncredit risks including without limitation market risks or liquidity   the ratings take into consideration the credit quality of the underlying mortgaged properties and the mortgage loans structural and legal aspects associated with the offered certificates and the extent to which the payment stream of the mortgage loans is adequate to make payments required under the offered certificates however as noted above the ratings do not represent an assessment of the likelihood timing or frequency of principal prepayments both voluntary and involuntary by the borrowers or the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated in general the ratings address credit risk and not prepayment risk ratings are forwardlooking opinions about credit risk and express an agency’s opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations in full and on time ratings are not indications of investment merit in addition the ratings do not represent an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience or the possibility that investors might not fully recover their initial investment in the event of delinquencies or defaults or rapid prepayments on the mortgage loans including both voluntary and involuntary prepayments or the application of any realized losses in the event that holders of such certificates do not fully recover their investment as a result of rapid principal prepayments on the mortgage loans all amounts “due” to such holders will nevertheless have been paid and such result is consistent with the ratings assigned to such certificates as indicated in this prospectus holders of the certificates with notional amounts are entitled only to payments of interest on the related mortgage loans if the mortgage loans were to prepay in the initial month with the result that the holders of the certificates with notional amounts receive only a single month’s interest and therefore suffer a nearly complete loss of their investment all amounts “due” to such holders will nevertheless have been paid and such result is consistent with the rating received on those certificates the notional amounts of the certificates with notional amounts on which interest is calculated may be reduced by the allocation of realized losses and prepayments whether voluntary or involuntary the ratings do not address the timing or magnitude of reductions of such notional amount but only the obligation to pay interest timely on the notional amount as so reduced from time to time therefore the ratings of the certificates with notional amounts should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities see “risk factors—other risks relating to the certificates—your yield may be affected by defaults prepayments and other factors” and “yield and maturity considerations”   although the depositor will prepay fees for ongoing rating surveillance by certain of the rating agencies the depositor has no obligation or ability to ensure that any rating agency performs ratings surveillance in addition a rating agency may cease ratings surveillance if the information furnished to that rating agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance        any of the three nrsros that we hired may issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of certificates that we did not hire it to rate additionally other nrsros that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates relying on information they receive pursuant to rule g or otherwise if any such unsolicited ratings are issued we cannot assure you that they will not be different from those ratings assigned by the rating agencies the issuance of unsolicited ratings of a class of the offered certificates that are lower than the ratings assigned by the rating agencies may adversely impact the liquidity market value and regulatory characteristics of that class as part of the process of obtaining ratings for the offered certificates the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to five nrsros based on final feedback from those five nrsros at that time the depositor hired the rating agencies to rate the offered certificates and not the other two nrsros due in part to those nrsros’ initial subordination levels for the various classes of offered certificates had the depositor selected such other nrsros to rate the offered certificates we cannot assure you as to the ratings that such other nrsros would ultimately have assigned to the certificates in the case of one nrsro hired by the depositor the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated offered certificates due in part to the final subordination levels provided by that nrsro for the classes of offered certificates if the depositor had selected that nrsro to rate those other classes of offered certificates not rated by it its ratings of those other offered certificates may have been different and potentially lower than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by the other two nrsros hired by the depositor although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nrsro an nrsro might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided
