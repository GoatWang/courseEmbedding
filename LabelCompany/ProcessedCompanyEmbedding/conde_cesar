of police brutality hold those who serve and protect us to their highest accountability paint and brushes are my weapon  the canvas tells my story as a post realist social justice artist the bang bang project was born the day of michael browns killer was acquitted we want justice now continued abuse of power are perpetuated towards people of color every second we need to address this issue and act now no one should be arrested and be found dead  days later due to supposedly suicide on a traffic violation  it will take all of us to change a system this is my contribution to the dialogue of race

love to you artist talk will happen in december during rd friday the spirit of the project is captured in the video peace cesar  read more update  posted by renee laverne rose  months ago    share    november th  remains to be one of the most fulfilled moment in my life the passion shared by adia alli and mignon mcpherson stewart in their performance was breathtaking and poignant the voices of the annointed one lifted us all in another level where differences were set aside and humanity shined in the background were  bang bang paintings communing with each other and with those present and gone the night was celebratory and solemn as another black man was killed while handcuffed protest against it was happening in minneapolis the air had dread as the soon to be released videotape of an unarmed teen shoot over a dozen times will be released as ordered by a judge in chicago however hope healing and compassion filled the air as lines “i can’t breathe” was filled the air of the gallery hands held one another hugged each other in the crowd as the line” hands up don’t shoot” were exclaimed and recited by the powerful artists activist who were performing the piece that evening we all became one in the gallery space a magical evening of life and art intertwining all colors of life breathed the same air of exuberance and hope may art continue to thrive and that it plants a seeds of positive change so that one day we don’t have to scream “hands up don’t shoot” ……just a few comments from others who have been touched names withheld for privacy cesar what an extraordinary evening you hosted your work and the evenings representation of it reminded me of a quote by vincent van goghi am seeking i am striving i am in it with all of my heart your passion talent and commitment to living in a world that is a better place was evident in every element of the evening each piece was unique and told its own story the eyes in each work through which it is said that you can see the soul left me haunted and conflicted to me each piece spoke the question of why why did this happen why is this me the theatrical performance hit just the right note challenging points of view but not preachy making me ask myself where i stand on the continuum of judgement in a day where values and respect for human kind and one another are seemingly more conflicted than at any time in our life history the musical performance hit exactly the right note in drawing us all together and in touching every heart in the room it resonated a common ground where all of us regardless of point of view ethnicity cultural background could merge hearts and understand and value each other i believe it was eugene delacroix that said what moves men of genius or rather what inspires their work is not new ideas but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is not enough all hail cesar you are making the world a better place thank you for taking us on this journey with you “ “ i watched the youtube video for a bit and i had to stop it because i became very emotional i appreciate mr condes work greatly and i hope that many will understand how the work that he has captured in art form is harsh reality for many” please go to the bang bang project facebook page for more pictures of the opening much mad love world…and thank you so much cesar  read more update  posted by renee
