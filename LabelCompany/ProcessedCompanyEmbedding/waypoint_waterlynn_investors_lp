journal subscribe to barron’s dow jonesscoops starwood waypoint colony american homes in talks to merge log in risk  compliance factiva the wall street journal djx starwood waypoint colony american homes in talks to merge by ryan dezember two big owners of singlefamily rental homes are in talks to merge a bet that rents will keep rising and homes will remain difficult for many americans to buy starwood waypoint residential trust a publicly traded realestate investment trust run by barry sternlicht the longtime realestate investor who is starwood capital group’s chief executive plans to combine with closely held colony american homes inc according to people familiar with the talks the possible deal values colony at about  billion based on starwood waypoint’s closing share price friday barring a lastminute snarl the merger could be announced as soon as monday these people said the two companies own a combined total of more than  homes valued at nearly  billion messrs sternlicht and his counterpart at colony thomas barrack jr were part of the rush by big investors to buy foreclosed homes in bulk often sight unseen and at steep discounts after the us housing market collapsed such investors concentrated their buying in some of the hardesthit areas including southern florida phoenix atlanta and california hoping to gain enough size in each market to make management of the properties more efficient other major buyers of singlefamily rental homes include blackstone group lp which has spent nearly  billion to acquire and spruce up about  foreclosed homes now rented through its invitation homes lp the proposed merger of starwood waypoint and colony is a bet that the percentage of americans who own homes will remain unusually low while the foreclosure crisis has receded toughened lending standards have pushed millions of americans out of the homebuying market higher interest rates would increase borrowing costs and make it harder for some renters to buy homes the federal reserve decided last week not to raise shortterm interest rates from near zero where they have held since  but the central bank is expected to revisit the matter later this year the us homeownership rate is at its lowest level in nearly  years falling to  in the second quarter according to the commerce department in contrast singlefamily rentals now add up to  of overall housing stock up from  in  according to a report by moody’s analytics rents have been climbing steadily though some analysts and investors question how long it can last especially in areas with weak wage growth many of the rental homes scooped up by big investors are in those parts of the us the singlefamily rental home business was long dominated by momandpop operators big investors have used their access to capital and numbercrunching skill to barrel into the market starwood waypoint touts algorithms it has developed to guide decisions that include which neighborhoods to target the response from stockmarket investors has been mostly tepid so far as of friday starwood waypoint shares were down about  since its spinoff from starwood property trust last year shares of american homes  rent which owned  homes in  states as of june  have risen  since their stockmarket debut in august  blackstone executives have said they plan to eventually list shares of invitation homes through an initial public offering bond buyers have been more enthusiastic snapping up the debt issued by some companies in the sector in the two years since blackstone’s invitation homes sold the first bond backed by rents from a pool of houses  billion of such bonds have been sold according to kroll bond rating agency inc singlefamily rental companies must convince investors that the singlefamily rental model will remain viable if homeownership levels rebound some outsiders also question how much more firms like blackstone colony and starwood waypoint can grow now that so many of the most deeply discounted foreclosed homes have been purchased singlefamily rental companies also face questions about their ability to maintain tens of thousands of scattered properties the chores include cutting lawns fixing sinks insurance and keeping track of rental rates and payments big investors need to amass enough market share to keep their operating costs in check in june starwood waypoint said the company and other institutional investors owned roughly  of the  million us rental homes suggesting significant room for expansion if other conditions are ripe executives at starwood waypoint and colony believe that combining the two companies would boost investor comfort and confidence in the singlefamily rental home business according to people familiar with the merger talks the two companies believe that a merger would result in as much as  million in cost reductions according to people familiar with the matter if the deal goes through colony investors would own  of the combined company’s shares while starwood waypoint shareholders would own  starwood waypoint would issue new shares as part of the merger terms of the proposed deal call for messrs sternlicht and barrack to share chairmanship of the combined company write to ryan dezember at ryandezemberwsjcom breaking the story ryan dezember was first to report that reit starwood waypoint residential
