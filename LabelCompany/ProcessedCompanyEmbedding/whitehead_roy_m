share roy m whitehead guest columnistdeveloper by roy m whitehead posted april    regarding michael goforth’s recent column about florida development dragons there are two sides to every argument having been a developer and builder during my working career i have seen and heard and given most arguments for and against development we agree that many developments in recent years have been illadvised and illplanned approved by local governments more for tax revenues than for benefit to the community we have seen this in fort pierce we also agree there has been a toogreat proliferation of paving and infrastructure extensions but some of this problem can be laid at the feet of environmentalists for a time i represented a builder of garden apartment projects in the midwest for which i handled much of the rezoning and land plan approvals for these projects to be feasible densities had to be higher than singlefamily developments which local environmentalists usually fought against the company was providing a highquality product usually twostory brick structures of the “williamsburg” design the developments usually included a clubhouse playgrounds and considerable open space a golf course was sometimes included to provide open space and an amenity for the community reasonable and quality rentals of relatively highdensity were and still are needed to provide decent housing for those who can’t afford or don’t want to own a singlefamily home in the early s i was chief executive of a development company on hilton head island sc the best developments on the island in the early years took place without benefit of zoning laws or building codes design was marketdriven with developers competing based on good architecture quality and environmental considerations many of these developments had relatively high density zoning laws and building codes were enacted due mostly to efforts of environmentalists and development reverted to the “clearandpave” mentality of municipal planners environmental planning became secondary in recent years we saw the push for ultralow densities in martin county and other areas in florida driving development into agricultural areas recently some advocates of lowdensity zoning awakened to the rapid encroachment of development into agricultural lands and the everglades they concluded that perhaps cities should be redeveloped with higher densities to avoid paving over the everglades there still is the question about where we are going to put people as the population expands we understand concerns about overdevelopment in florida but is this not the same “notinmybackyard” mentality we see regarding power plants solar energy panels and wind generators this is reflective of the “burnthebridge” syndrome “i have mine let’s keep everyone else out” locally we have seen the fight against highdensity developments but the argument has been more about building height than density harbor isle is a good example of what high density can be when there are height restrictions in place the argument always has been about obstructing views but harbor isle while probably a pleasant place to live is an impenetrable viewblocker taller buildings with more open space might be preferable a two or threestory building obstructs one’s view anyway and a solid phalanx of low buildings obstructs views far worse than a single taller building with open space around it with underbuilding parking the paving footprint and infrastructure is substantially reduced a plus for those concerned with the environment there is no magic answer and people will continue to come local governments would do better to find ways to allow welldesigned and higherdensity developments even if building height restrictions have to be modified unless we do this we might as well fire up the bulldozers and pavers the everglades will continue to disappear as will the lifestyle and environment that we cherish whitehead is a retired builderdeveloper
