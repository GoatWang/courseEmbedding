the “company” was organized under the laws of the state of nevada on december   as jubilee resources inc to explore mineral properties in north america the name of the company was subsequently changed to jasper explorations inc on december   the name of the company was again changed on january   from jasper explorations inc to jpx global inc   on february   the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of scorpex inc in exchange for  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock of the company a material condition of the agreement production of audited financial statements was not provided by scorpex and therefore the acquisition agreement was terminated on may   we then resumed operations that existed prior to february   primarily the exploration for copper molybdenum and other minerals   on february   the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of scorpex inc a nevada corporation in exchange for  shares of common stock and  shares of series b preferred stock the “acquisition” we are now expanding our business to further develop our operations as a development stage waste disposal and recycling company with the goal of storing and disposing all types of waste including those classified as industrial toxic and hazardous with the acquisition of the scorpex assets the company has a business model to capitalize on the opportunities available in the integrated waste and waste management services sector primarily in mexico through its exclusive license with tratamientos ambientales scorpion sa de cv tas a mexican corporation we will participate in tas’s developing approximately  acres it owns located at fraccion a del rancho el encinito km  carretera a ensenadaojos delegacion real del castillo ensenada bc cp  for the purpose of storing and disposing of residential and commercial toxic nontoxic hazardous and nonhazardous waste in addition to the ensenada property detailed above tas has finalized a lease for a second property of approximately  hectacres located at parcela  y  plan libertador blvd  rosarito bc this rosarito lease is a month term lease with a lessee option to renew every  months indefinitely the cost for the lease is  per month tas is a mexican holding company that owns property permits and limited structures and has licensed its assets exclusively to jpx global inc in return for twenty percent  of net revenues from operations in mexico   waste disposal plan of operations   we are a development stage company with no history of operations as a result of the acquisition of the scorpex assets the company intends to further capitalize on opportunities in its integrated waste and waste management service operations including the receiving storage transfer and disposal in an environmental manner in providing these services we intend to actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment which will be focused on gasification of waste in an environmental manner it is expected that our customer base will include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entity properties we are a development stage company and have not realized any revenues we do not have sufficient capital to enable us to commence and complete our exploration program we will require additional financing in order to conduct the exploration programs described herein our auditors have issued a going concern opinion raising substantial doubt about the company’s financial prospects and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern      table of contents   waste management and collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to our planned gasification facilities we intend to subcontract our collection services waste is defined as nonhazardous waste sent offsite for final disposal through gasification including household waste commercial business or institutional waste construction and demolition debris regulated medical waste yard waste sludge scrap tires and hazardous waste   the waste gasificationthermal oxidation plant where we intend to convert waste to ash is a twostage waste combustion process that converts combustible organic matter from its existing solid sludge or liquid state into a gas under an oxygen depleted environment also known as “oxidation” the resulting gas product is then well mixed with ambient air before being burnt off in a secondary gasprocessing unit the technology reverts any man made or organic waste product back to its natural state which is inert ash or breathable air the technology is capable of handling community solid waste content and biosolids including medical waste tires plastics wood waste oily waste furniture and other organic or manmade compounds found in municipal or industrial waste   the intended plant is comprised of three basic components a primary gasification cell a secondary gas processor and a computerized process logic controller combustible waste material is placed into the primary gasification cell through the load access door in some facilities this can be done via a loading conveyor the proposed design is to have collection vehicles dump their waste load directly into the primary oxidation cell none of these components have been built on the property   the primary cell can be either a batch or continuous feed processor based on our research batch processing provides the most efficient and cost effective strategy for the waste management solution in the case of batch processing once the cell has received that days collected waste the door is closed and the process is initiated the cell does not have to be full for the system to be activated   an operator is responsible for supervising the loading of waste material and initiating the process startup a computer keystroke or optional manual button and lever control which preheats the secondary gasprocessing unit accomplishes this startup once that unit reaches its preset temperature the primary gasification cell heater is activated and the process begins approximately  to  hours later the organic wastes in the primary cell will have been converted to a gas and the cycle will generally be complete the system will move to its “cool down” mode in another  hours the system may be reloaded and another process started with or without the removal of the preceding load’s ash material   residual materials bottles cans ash and misc need only to be removed periodically the composition of msw consists mainly of organic and combustible waste glass and metals are easily extracted in our plant design as it includes equipment that will assist in the process and cut down on labor manhours ash removal is either an automated or manual process in automated unloading the base of the primary gasification cell contains a ductile iron furnace floor conveyor that evacuates material remaining in the base of the unit through a side access door this dry waste material empties into a storage bin which can be removed to another location for recycling   aluminum metal and glass can be completely recovered emissions may be captured and used as a nonfossil fuel source for various “on site” processes   our intention is to take the ash that is left over from our disposal process and create a brick out of the residue the machines that will be used through  thousand pounds of pressure will create this brick that can then be donated back to any municipality for various uses   we intend to provide our services under two types of agreements      table of contents       • for commercial and industrial collection services we intend to enter a multiyear service agreement the fees under these agreements will be influenced by factors such as collection frequency type and volume or weight of the waste collected distance to our facility labor costs cost of gasification and general market factors   • for most residential collection services we will have a contract with or a franchise granted by a municipality homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that will give us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of the homes in an area these contracts or franchises are typically for periods of one to five years we expect the fees for residential collection to be either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service   with its current assets and without further financing our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern however the company plans to raise the capital necessary to fund our business through a private placement andor a public offering of our common stock   because the company has incurred losses income tax expenses are immaterial no tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carryforwards given the uncertainty of the company being able to utilize such loss carryforwards in future years the company anticipates incurring additional losses during the coming year   market   we believe that the  billion us waste management industry will play a substantial role in the coming economic recovery and the growth of worldwide trade as traditional waste conversion as well as the more technical methods such as gasification plasma arc gasification hydrolysis and pyrolysis become cheaper and more efficient in a world where in  alone the world’s rapidly increasing urban population generated nearly  billion tons of municipal solid waste “msw” it is no longer sufficient to discard trash it is estimated that this number will rise to at least  billion tons by  today more than  thermal wastetoenergy “wte” plants operate in nearly  countries around the globe led by asiapacific and europe this number is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade potentially treating  million tons of msw annually by  with an estimated output of  terawatt hours twh of electricity of the municipal solid waste generated  percent was recycled in  up from  percent in    competition   the solid waste industry is very competitive competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies private solid waste companies large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private wastetoenergy companies we also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills   operating costs disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout mexico the prices that we intend to charge will be determined locally and typically vary by the volume and weight type of waste collected treatment requirements risk of handling or disposal frequency of collections distance to final disposal sites labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer we will face intense competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of service however we believe that we can distinguish the company from our competition by providing precise accounting exceptional customer service      table of contents     comprehensive tax management and competitive pricing while we intend to offer some customers credit terms in most cases the credit lines will be secured by corporate or personal guarantees deposits letters of credit or other bank instruments and liens   compliance with government regulation   we will be required to conduct all waste disposal activities in accordance with government regulations such operations are subject to various laws governing land use the protection of the environment production exports taxes labor standards occupational health waste disposal toxic substances safety and other matters unfavorable amendments to current laws regulations and permits governing operations and activities of resource exploration companies or more stringent implementation thereof could have a materially adverse impact and cause increases in capital expenditures which could result in a cessation of operations   employees   we use the services of various contract personnel from time to time although national unemployment rates remain high relative to historical averages there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the waste management and waste conversion industry nevertheless we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business resulting from future acquisitions and joint ventures further we expect to continue to use consultants contract labor attorneys and accountants as necessary   available information   jpx global inc is subject to the information

    on october   the company sold  restricted shares of common stock to an accredited investor at  per share for total proceeds of    with respect to the transactions noted above no solicitation was made and no underwriting discounts were given or paid in connection with these transactions the company believes that the issuance of the shares as described above was exempt from registration with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section  of the securities act of    penny stock rules   the sec has also adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” as such term is defined by rule g penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system   the shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stocks under the exchange act the shares may remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future the classification of our shares as penny stocks makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in jpx global will be subject to the penny stock rules   the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules deliver a standardized risk disclosure document approved by the sec which i contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading ii contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the securities act iii contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and significance of the spread between the bid and ask price iv contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions v defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks and vi contains such other information and is in such form as the sec shall require by rule or regulation the brokerdealer also must provide to the customer prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock i bid and offer quotations for the penny stock ii the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction iii the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and iv monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities   item  selected financial data   not required      table of contents       item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   forwardlooking statements   this report contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements you should not place too much reliance on these forwardlooking statements our actual results are likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons   overview   on february   the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of scorpex inc a nevada corporation in exchange for  shares of common stock and  shares of series b preferred stock we are now expanding our business to further develop our operations to capitalize on the opportunities available primarily in mexico in the integrated waste and waste management service operations including the receiving storage transfer and disposal of waste in an environmental manner in providing these services we intend to actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment which will be focused on gasification of waste in an environmental manner it is expected that our customer base will include commercial industrial municipal and residential customers other waste management companies electric utilities and governmental entity properties we are an exploration stage company and we have not realized any revenues to date we do not have sufficient capital to enable us to commence and complete our exploration program we will require additional financing in order to conduct the exploration program described herein our auditors have issued a going concern opinion raising substantial doubt about the companys financial prospects and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern as a waste management company our principal sources of revenue will result from waste management contracts but will also include revenue from ancillary services related to the handling and conversion of waste expenses which comprise the costs of goods sold include the operational and staffing costs of the trucks and other vehicles used for transporting and special licensing where required general and administrative expenses have been comprised of administrative wages and benefits occupancy and office expenses outside legal accounting and other professional fees travel and other miscellaneous office and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses include sellingmarketing wages and benefits advertising and promotional expenses as well as travel and other miscellaneous related expenses   because we have incurred losses income tax expenses are immaterial no tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carryforwards given our uncertainty of being able to utilize such loss carryforwards in future years we anticipate incurring additional losses during the coming year   results of operations   following is management’s discussion of the relevant items affecting results of operations for the years ended december   and    revenues  the company generated net revenues of  during both years ended december   and         table of contents     consulting fees  consulting fees for the year ended december   were  compared to  for the year ended december   during the year ended december   the company issued  shares of common stock for services rendered to the company the shares were valued at  which represented the market price on the dates of issuance during the year ended december   the company issued  shares of common stock for services rendered to the company the shares were valued at  which represented the market price on the dates of issuance   professional fees professional fees for the year ended december   were  compared to  for the year ended december   professional fees consist mainly of the fees for the audits and reviews of the company’s financial statements as well as the filings with the sec we anticipate that professional fees will increase in future periods as we scale up our operations   other general and administrative expenses other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   were  compared to  for the year ended december   the company expects other general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we scale up our operations   other income expense the company had net other expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  during  the net other expense in  includes expense from the change in fair value of derivative liability of  this derivative liability was calculated using the blackscholes model other expenses consist of interest expenses on promissory notes payable   liquidity and capital resources   as of december   the company’s primary source of liquidity consisted of  in cash and cash equivalents since inception the company has financed its operations through a combination of short term loans from related parties and others and through the private placement of its common stock   the company has sustained significant net losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit at december   of  and is currently experiencing a substantial shortfall in operating capital which raises doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company generated a net loss for the year ended december   of  compared to a net loss for the year ended december   of  without additional revenues working capital loans or equity investment there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue operations   we believe these conditions have resulted from the inherent risks associated with small public companies such risks include but are not limited to the ability to i generate revenues and sales of our products and services at levels sufficient to cover our costs and provide a return for investors ii attract additional capital in order to finance growth and iii successfully compete with other comparable companies having financial production and marketing resources significantly greater than those of the company   we believe that our capital resources are insufficient for ongoing operations with minimal current cash reserves particularly given the resources necessary to expand our waste management business we will likely require considerable amounts of financing to make any significant advancement in our business strategy there is presently no agreement in place that will guarantee financing for our company and we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise any additional funds or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms funds raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially dilutive to current shareholders lack of additional funds will materially affect our company and our business and may cause us to substantially curtail or even cease operations consequently you could incur a loss of your entire investment in the company      table of contents       offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements   critical accounting policies   we believe the following critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of our financial statements   use of estimates      the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates on a periodic basis management reviews those estimates including those related to valuation allowances loss contingencies income taxes and projection of future cash flows   research and development      research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses   recent accounting pronouncements   see note  in the notes to the financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements   there were various other accounting standards and interpretations recently issued none of which are expected to a have a material impact on the companys financial position operations or cash flows   forwardlooking statements   this report contains or incorporates by reference forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the united states private securities litigation reform act of  concerning our future business plans and strategies the receipt of working capital future revenues and other statements that are not historical in nature in this report forwardlooking statements are often identified by the words “anticipate” “plan” “believe” “expect” “estimate” and the like these forwardlooking statements reflect our current beliefs expectations and opinions with respect to future events and involve future risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied   other uncertainties that could affect the accuracy of forwardlooking statements include     • the worldwide economic situation   • any changes in interest rates or inflation • the willingness and ability of third parties to honor their contractual commitments • our ability to raise additional capital as it may be affected by current conditions in the  stock market and competition for risk capital • our capital expenditures as they may be affected by delays or cost overruns • environmental and other regulations

preferred stock was created and designated with supervoting rights of  votes per share of series a preferred stock held but no conversion dividend and liquidation rights   on february   the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the operating assets of scorpex inc “scorpex” an entity related by common control in exchange for  shares of common stock and  shares of series b preferred stock of the company scorpex is majority owned and controlled by jpx global inc’s then controlling shareholder joseph caywood each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into  shares of

of a license agreement the company has modified its business plan to include the development of waste management services including the storage recycling and disposal of waste the company does not presently have any waste management operations   the acquired assets consist primarily of a license agreement between scorpex and tratamientos ambientales scorpion sa de cv a corporation formed under the laws of mexico “tas” this license agreement with tas has been assigned to jpx tas is a wholly owned subsidiary of scorpex and is therefore a common control entity asc  provides guidance on measuring assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control as the entities are under common control and the license agreement had no basis on scorpex’s books they are being acquired at their carrying amounts with no cost basis on the date of transfer and therefore the transaction value is    the license agreement was dated july   and provided scorpex with an exclusive worldwide license for the permits property and any and all of tas’s other assets necessary for the business of storing recycling disposing and treating waste in mexico for a term of  years the

going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company does not have sufficient working capital for its planned activity and to service its debt which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the company has incurred accumulated losses of  since inception through december     continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional working capital the management of the company has developed a strategy which it believes will accomplish this objective through short term loans from related parties and additional equity investments which will enable the company to continue operations for the coming year these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty      table of contents   jpx global inc notes to the financial statements december   and    note  summary of significant accounting policies   accounting methods   the company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   income tax   the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be reversed an allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized   basic and diluted net income loss per share   the company follows asc topic  to account for the earnings per share basic earnings per common share “eps” calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding   for the years ended december   and  the common shares underlying the following dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive       common shares issuable     year ended

of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized upon completion of services or delivery of goods where the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collectability is reasonably assured the company has no revenue to date   advertising and market development   the company expenses advertising and market development costs as of december   the company has not incurred any advertising and market development costs      table of contents   jpx global inc notes to the financial statements december   and    impairment of longlived assets   the company reviews and evaluates longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the assets are subject to impairment consideration under fasb asc  if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable when the company determines that an impairment analysis should be done the analysis will be performed using the rules of fasb asc  asset impairment and  through  impairment or disposal of longlived assets   environmental requirements   at the report date environmental requirements related to a formally held mineral claim are unknown and therefore any estimate of future costs cannot be made   mineral property acquisition costs   costs of acquisition and option costs of mineral rights are capitalized upon acquisition mine development costs incurred to develop new ore deposits to expand the capacity of mines or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are also capitalized once proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property   costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations if the company does not continue with exploration after the completion of the feasibility study the mineral rights will be expensed at that time costs of abandoned projects are charged to mining costs including related property and equipment costs to determine if these costs are in excess of their recoverable amount periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows andor estimated salvage value in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc  impairment or disposal of longlived assets   various factors could impact our ability to achieve forecasted production schedules additionally commodity prices capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions the company may use in cash flow models from exploration stage mineral interests this however involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically   estimates and assumptions   management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported revenues and expenses actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements        table of contents   jpx global inc notes to the financial statements december   and    stockbased compensation   the company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in asc topic  and  which requires the company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards this eliminates accounting for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method the company recognizes the cost of all sharebased awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award   the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with fasb asc  and the conclusions reached by the fasb asc  costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by fasb asc    fair value of financial instruments   fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december   the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values these financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts payable and accrued liabilities advances from related party notes payable to related parties notes payable and convertible loan payable – related party fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand   level  the preferred inputs to valuation efforts are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities not assumptions and thus offers superior reliability however relatively few items especially physical assets actually trade in active markets   level  fasb acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and even when they do exist they may be too thin to provide reliable information to deal with this shortage of direct data the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations   level  if inputs from levels  and  are not available fasb acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise the board describes level  inputs as unobservable and limits their use by saying they shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available this category allows for situations in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date earlier in the standard fasb explains that observable inputs are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants

issued fasb asc   fasb asc  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements  this standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position  if the morelikelythannot threshold is met a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements  as a result of the implementation of this standard the company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by fasb asc      deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences  temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that may be offset against future taxable income through  no tax benefits have been reported in the financial statements because the potential tax benefits of the net operating loss carry forwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount   due to the change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  net
