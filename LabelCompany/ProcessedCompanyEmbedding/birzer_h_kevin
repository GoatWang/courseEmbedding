fund has averaged  annual returns over the past three yrsfor investors looking for income and an energy allocation the tortoise mlp  pipeline fund has performed like a harethe mutual fund ticker tortx  boasts one of the top performances among an increasing variety of funds that invest in master limited partnerships those energy pipeline and infrastructure assets with rich taxdeferred yields but the fund owns regular energy corporations too and the combo has produced a threeyear annualized return of roughly  and a  total return in the past year well ahead of the standard  poors  energy index and the benchmark alerian mlp indexthe funds five comanagers look for businesses that produce doubledigit cashflow growth and collect steady fees and with gushers from american oilandgas fields filling pipelines coast to coast the funds relatively low dividend should continue its recent growth spurtwe asked comanager h kevin birzer to talk about picks and risks birzer cofounded tortoise capital advisors which is one of the largest mlp asset managers and is based in leawood kanbarronscom how do you choose winners birzer it comes down to do these assets have to exist second question is do they have the right management team third we dont want a lot of cash flow volatility risk we look at the nature of the assets and the contract structure refiners have huge volatility a pipeline on the other hand generally gets paid for transporting the product into the refinery and out of the refinery based on volume there has been a heck of a lot of activity with the shale plays and pipelines tend to be the cheapest easiest way to get those hydrocarbons to market managers bioname h kevin birzerage  title cofounder tortoise capital advisors and coportfolio manager tortoise mlp  pipeline fundeducation bs university of notre dame mba new york universityfree time reading cofounder and volunteer with the giving grove a kansas city nonprofit that develops inner city edible tree gardensq what names do you like a our top holding today is spectra energy  se  a large diversified pipeline company that is investmentgrade rated and has a  billion market capitalization they own spectra energy partners  sep  an mlp spectra energy has a great footprint of assets its texas eastern pipeline goes from texas up to new york city carrying natural gas right smack dab through pennsylvania where the marcellus shale has gone from virtually no production to about  billion cubic feet per day nearly  of the us supply of natural gas now comes through pennsylvania it is just crazy how this has changed over the last five years spectra is in the process of making that pipeline bidirectional to reverse gas from new york and take it back to tennessee or other parts of the country that is a great asset spectra also has a valuable pipeline from canadas oil sands that extends to missouri they have about  billion in pipeline growth projects with pretty good commitments up front for both return of your capital as well as return on your capital during the contract period that means low risk spectra can grow its distributions at about a  rate for many years to come it yields about  probably  annual returns over the long termq will pipelines become obsolete as oil and gas production dwindles a in some cases yes there are some pipelines that are so so strategic and they are sitting on a gold mine spectras pipelines are sitting on some gold mines fund facts as of july  tortoise mlp  pipeline fund tortxassets  billionexpense ratio front load annual portfolio turnover  yield source morningstar q spectra stock is near a week high how much upside is there a we have added to our position over time from  and it is near  today as a longterm investment i think it is a strong buy we do a longterm discounted cash flow analysis no matter how you slice and dice it you end up with the current yield yield growth and visibility into that growth in new york city you are not going to heat your home this winter if spectra doesnt existq what other names do you like a williams cos  wmb  a corporation as opposed to williams partners  wpz  the mlp it operates  miles of interstate gas pipelines more than  miles of oil and gas gathering pipelines it is a pure play general partner on williams partners and access midstream partners  acmp  which are to merge williams got rid of a lot of its exploration and production assets they now have one of the biggest gathering and processing businesses in the country williams has a footprint in all the big plays in the country except the bakken it is an investmentgraderated company with  billion in marketequity capitalization they are just getting paid for moving products from point a to point b about  of their business will be feebased after the merger they are doing q what would be the case for buying it here a similar to spectra yield plus growth the company says it can grow cash flow  annually every year between now and  williams cos has a  yield and if you add  growth you have upperteens returns this isnt a trade this is a longterm investment top  holdingsas of may  spectra energy sewilliams cos wmboneok okenisource nieqt eqtenbridge enbplains gp holdings pagpenterprise products partners epdtranscanada trppembina pipeline pbasource tortoise capital advisors q why arent we talking about pricetoearnings ratios a we can talk about pe we can talk about enterprise value to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda we can talk about discounted cash flow in my mind this is one segment of the world where just talking about yield and growth is the best proxy for returnsq another pick a oneok  oke  is the general partner a corporation that controls what happens at the master limited partnership oneok partners  oks  two different legal entities but their assets are extremely closely tiedq the general partner gets a rising percentage of the distribution what else do you like about oneok the corporation a about twothirds of its business is feebased  very low risk and a great investment and they have a big footprint in the bakken shale unlike williams and spectra they have about  billion in their construction backlog and  billion to  billion in unannounced projects their market cap is about  billion they think they can grow their distribution at least  per annum for the next several years i get a mid yield with  growth so  returns is a heck of a good story q you see big opportunities in the permian basin in texas who benefits a plains all american pipeline  paa  we own the general partner plains gp holdings  pagp  plains probably touches  of the crude oil in our country every single day if plains all american didnt exist youd have a problem plains also happens to have this great footprint in west texas as new pipelines are built plains benefits q barrons has questioned how mlps account for maintenance capital expenditures including kinder morgan  kmi  which tortoise owns what are your thoughts a you have to be careful what makes up that distributable cash flow is operating income or ebitda you start with ebitda you back out interest expenses or your debt burden and you back out maintenance capital expenditures that leaves distributable cash flow  whats available to pay out there could be an inherent conflict of interest management may want to skimp on maintenance capital expenditures because that would increase what is paid out  distributable cash flow if a management team is trying to cut corners cut the maintenance capital expenditures you could have an issue we ask have the companies reinvested appropriately have they accounted for it appropriately have they disclosed appropriately to investors we invest in managements that are running assets for the long termq what else do you worry about a interest rate risks broad economic risk the replumbing issue there are basins that probably arent as valuable anymore the haynesville three to five years ago was a hot natural gas play but it is not as economic to get natural gas out of that area today with natural gas prices in the range of  to  per million british thermal units to get canadian oil sands out of the ground oil needs to be priced at  to  a barrel if oil prices drop to  or  you may not have a whole lot going on in canadian oil sands i worry about regulation especially tax changes but also about fracking i worry about what is allowed as an mlp asset q what kind of returns do you expect from pipelines in  a our expectation from the day we started this company  years ago until today really has not changed a lot low double digits  to  ten years ago i would have said yields of  and distribution growth of  to  today i probably would say lower yields probably  but higher growth and  to  returns long term q thanks m snapshot of tortx httpquotesmorningstarcomfundfttortxregionusacultureenus comments pete july  thanks for posting looks very interesting i never heard of this fund and its performance compares favorably with other mlp open or closed end funds and etfs it is ntf at schwab and tda but not at fidelity it seemsi keep it on
