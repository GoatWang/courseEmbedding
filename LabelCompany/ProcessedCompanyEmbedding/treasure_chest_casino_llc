ricahrd anthony weigand weigand  levenson new orleans la for plaintiff pater b tompkins james melvin jacobs murphy rogers  sloss new orleans la for defendant order  reasons fallon district judge before the court are the following motions  motion of the plaintiff lloyd hertz hertz for partial summary judgment on the issue of jones act seaman status and  motion of defendants for summary judgment on the basis that the treasure chest casino is not a vessel in navigation as a matter of law for the following reasons the court denies the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment and grants the defendants motion i facts plaintiff hertz was employed as a captain aboard the treasure chest riverboat casino and on october   was injured in the course and scope of his employment while removing carpet from the deck of the casino he claims he was injured because he was provided improper  tools with which to do his assigned tasks plaintiff alleged that at the time of his injury the treasure chest was a vessel in navigation and he was a member of the crew entitling him to remedies against his employer and the vessel under the jones act  uscapp §  and the general maritime law defendant claims the treasure chest was not a vessel in navigation at the time of the plaintiffs injury precluding recovery under the jones act alternatively the plaintiff argues that he has a cause of action for negligence under the general maritime law defendant however contests the existence of this courts admiralty jurisdiction to hear such a dispute a brief review of the features of the treasure chest as well as it history is necessary to understand the parties arguments in the present motions the treasure chest has the following physical features a steel hull raked bow bilge pumps ballast tanks generator selfpropelled engine navigational aids crew quarters an operative pilot house steering mechanism life saving devices and a navigational crew it began operations in lake pontchartrain in september  from that point until march   the treasure chest was required to and did make daily cruises weather permitting for  minutes out of every three hours of operations at that time the treasure chest was clearly a vessel in navigation and the members of the crew were seamen under the jones act see williams v treasure chest casino  amc  edla  finding that plaintiffs had stated a cause of action under the jones act and general maritime law based on alleged claims of sexual harassment however on april   the louisiana statute regulating gaming aboard riverboat casinos was amended to provide that with regard to a riverboat casino located in jefferson parish gaming may only be conducted on a riverboat while it is docked and the licensee shall not conduct cruises or excursions larevstat ann § c see also larevstat ann §§     west supp since april   the treasure chest has been moored to the floating barge that serves as the dock one of the treasure chests captains testified by deposition that before the amendments the boat was secured by nylon mooring rope and cables attached to winches since then cables have been added that circle a bitt on the barge and on the boat and the cables are tightened with a ratchet to remove these cables and ready the ship for cruising the captain testified that it would be a fairly normal operation similar to that conducted by barges that are rigged for towing further the ship still conducts man overboard and fire drills at periodic intervals as well as periodic firing of the engines finally the captain understands that the management of the casino has no intention of conducting any gambling cruises in the foreseeable future the united states coast guard issued a certificate of inspection to the tresure chest in july  requiring it to remain in continuouslymoored operation on lake pontchartrain nevertheless the certificate requires that the pilothouse be manned at all times passengers are aboard the casino the treasure chest is licensed by the coast guard as a passenger vessel and required to have a master able and ordinary seamen a chief engineer and an oiler at all times she may also have up to  other persons in the crew on board the vessel in addition to passengers except for the designation that the boat be continuously moored the certificate of inspection is identical to the one issued by the coast guard before the  legislature amended the riverboat gambling statute the treasure chests owners argue that vessel status was lost at the moment the statute became effective plaintiff maintains that the treasure chest is still a vessel in navigation because it remains ready to sail at a moments notice plaintiff argues that the amended statute regulates only the activity which can take place on the contrivance not its capabilities as a vessel finally plaintiff points to two maintenance cruises the treasure chest conducted on june  and   for the purpose of conducting dredging operations beneath the casino as evidence of the casinos navigable capacities during these times plaintiff was responsible for the operation and navigation defendant however points out that at the time of these cruises no gambling occurred and the passengers were not permitted aboard the structure moreover at the time of his injury the plaintiff was removing carpet not piloting the vessel having discussed the facts of the case and the arguments of the parties the court now turns to the merits of the motions ii law  analysis a summary judgment standard a district court can grant a motion for summary judgment only when the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law celotex corp v catrett  us    s ct   l ed d   quoting fedrcivp c when considering a motion for summary judgment the district court will review the facts drawing all inferences most favorable to the party opposing the motion reid v state farm mut auto ins co  fd   th cir the court must find a factual dispute  to be genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party  and a fact  to be material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law beck v somerset techs inc  fd   th cir citing anderson v liberty lobby inc us    s ct   l ed d   if the moving party meets the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce evidence or designate specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial engstrom v first natl bank of eagle lake  fd   th cir citing celotex  us at   s ct  and fedrcivp e the mere argued existence of a factual dispute will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion see anderson  us at   s ct  if the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative summary judgment is appropriate id at   s ct  citations omitted b the jones act and vessel status recovery under the jones act is limited to seamen injured aboard a vessel in navigation see pavone v mississippi riverboat amusement corp  fd   th cir the fifth circuit has issued numerous opinions defining the term vessel in navigation including one on the issue of floating casinos ie pavone although vessel status is often a factintensive question making summary judgment difficult the parties do not dispute the essential facts of the present case rather what remains is the application of legal principles to those facts  defendants rely mainly on the fifth circuits decision in pavone and argue that the treasure chest has been withdrawn from navigation or is a work platform pavone concerned the claims of two plaintiffs who were injured on the biloxi belle casino in biloxi mississippi and subsequently pursued claims under the jones act the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants concluding the biloxi belle was not a vessel in navigation the fifth circuit affirmed id at  in order to properly determine the applicability of pavone to the case at hand the court must consider the physical features of the biloxi belle as set forth in the fifth circuits decision the biloxi belle was originally constructed in morgan city louisiana and towed to corpus christi texas where it served as a floating restaurant and bar several years later the restaurant was reoutfitted as a casino towed to biloxi and renamed the biloxi belle casino in biloxi the structure was secured to the shore by lines tied to sunken steel pylons further shoreside utility lines were connected permanently to the structure as for features similar to traditional vessels the biloxi belle had a steel hull raked bow bilge pumps and ballast tanks as for nonvessel features the biloxi belle has no engine captain navigational aids crew quarters or lifesaving equipment the pilot house is purely aesthetic and contains no operative steering mechanism the evidence indicated that the casino was moved only once from its location due to an impending hurricane the pavone court began its analysis by assuming that the biloxi belle was built for nonvessel purposes and was permanently or indefinitely moored to the bank thus making it withdrawn for navigation or a work platform id at  the court considered these concepts as intertwined and opined that both concepts may be defined by reference to three factors which were applicable in the case of such structures  whether the structure was originally constructed as a work platform  whether the structure is moored or secured at the time of the accident and  whether the platform is capable of movement and whether any transportation is incidental to its primary missionid at  citing gremillion v gulf coast catering co  fd   th cir  internal quotations omitted applying these precepts the fifth circuit found that the biloxi belle was never constructed for navigational purposesid at  further it was indefinitely  moored and had been at its present location since it became a casino except for one incident where it was moved due to an impending hurricane an event the court found incidental to the casinos function id the court concluded that the biloxi belle was a work platform and was removed from navigation thus it was not a vessel in navigation id accordingly the court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the defendant defendant in the present case also relies on a previous decision by this court in martin v boyd gaming corp  f supp d  edla in which the court held that the treasure chest was not a vessel as a matter of law see id at  the martin court relied on pavone and ducrepont v baton rouge marine enters and found that the tresure chest had ceased transportation on april   at the time the statute became effective the martin court further concluded that the two maintenance cruises were incidental to the vessels primary function as a floating but stationary gambling casino id further the court found that the defendants history of compliance with the state act and the coast guard certificate of inspection requiring a continuously moored operation indicated an intent to remain out of navigation id plaintiff insists that this court consider the treasure chests capacity to navigate on a moments notice and the fact that it has navigated twice since april   plaintiffs further point out that the louisiana legislature requires that riverboat gambling can only be conducted on a vessel which is certified by the united states coast guard for the carriage of passengers and crew see la rev stat ann  west supp the plaintiff finally notes that an attempt to amend this statute to allow gambling on barges was rejected in the louisiana legislature the court finds that such a showing in insufficient to confer vessel status the mere fact that a vessel has the capacity to resume navigation or is required to maintain coast guard inspection certificates does not change the fact that the tresure chest is legally prohibited from navigating the waters of lake pontchartrain while engaged in the very business for which it was constructed the only movements the treasure chest has undertaken were two maintenance cruises to allow for dredging no gambling was conducted and no passengers were aboard on either cruise such activities are clearly unrelated to the structures intended use as a casino instead the court finds the rationale of pavone and martin persuasive it is true that the treasure chest in this case and the biloxi belle in pavone are distinguishable in the sense that the bloxi belle was never constructed for vessel purposes while the treasure chest was once utilized as a vessel in navigation this however is a distinction without a difference in ducrepont the fifth circuit clearly stated that the fact that a vessel was once in navigation does not preclude it from later losing vessel status and becoming a work platform in fact this was the very issue before the ducrepont court see ducrepont v baton rouge marine enters  fd   th cir  the treasure chests owners have clearly manifested their intent to maintain operations on lake pontchartrain as a floating casino as such she is required by law to remain dockside and is not permitted to navigate while engaged in that business the court finds no evidence that the legislative requirements that the casino be inspected by the coast guard as a sign of intent to keep the employees under the coverage of the jones act further the two maintenance cruises are not connected to the function of the vessel which is to operate as a gambling casino finally the court is not persuaded by the plaintiffs analogy of the treasure chest to the special purpose structures discussed by the fifth circuit in manuel v paw drilling  well service inc  fd  th cir in which the court found a spud barge with a movable workover rig temporarily attached to be a vessel in navigation in manuel the court gave the following definition of such structures despite the outward appearance of the structure at issue if a primary purpose of the craft is to transport passengers cargo or equipment from place to place across navigable waters then that structure is a vessel id at  of great importance to the manuel court was the fact that although the structure was stationary at the time of the seamans injury it had been used to transport the seaman and equipment into place prior to that time see id at  for this reason manuel is distinguishable from the instant case in order to perform its designed function as a casino the treasure chest is required by law to remain dockside it moves neither cargo nor crew across navigable waters to accomplish its mission plaintiffs attempted comparison to the structures at issue in manuel is a repetition of its capacity argument which was rejected above iii plaintiffs cause of action under general maritime law plaintiff next asserts that if he is not a seaman then he still has a general maritime law cause of action because the treasure chest was floating in navigable waters at the time of his injury and thus within the admiralty jurisdiction of course the significance of determining admiralty jurisdiction in tort is not only to establish the availability of a federal forum but also to determine the applicable substantive law a holding that a particular occurrence is within the admiralty jurisdiction generally amounts to a holding that the law governing that occurrence is the substantive maritime law the policy justification for applying substantive maritime law within the admiralty jurisdiction is the necessity of uniformity under this doctrine it is the belief that in planning their conduct and business expenses persons engaged in maritime commerce should be able to rely on the applicability of a single law see hart the supreme court  term  harv lrev    see also southern pacific co v jensen  us    s ct   l ed   holding that state laws could not preempt application of the general maritime law if state laws come in conflict with the general maritime law the latter generally prevails even state workmans compensation statutes that interfere with general maritime law principles must bend to the dictates of general maritime law see green v vermilion corp  fd   th cir  thibodaux v atlantic richfield co  fd   th cir if the present case is within the courts admiralty jurisdiction and the applicable substantive law is general maritime law the plaintiff may have a tort claim against the treasure chest or its owner see  green supra thibodaux supra if the matter is not within the admiralty jurisdiction the plaintiff will be restricted to a compensation claim as an initial matter therefore this court must determine whether admiralty jurisdiction applies to the present claim a admiralty jurisdiction the source of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in the united states is article iii of the united states constitution that article in part provides the judicial power shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction nothing more is said the terms are not defined therefore to understand the nature and scope of admiralty jurisdiction it is helpful to examine the historical derivation of article iii and then review its subsequent development through judicial interpretation late in july of   resolutions adopted by the constitutional convention were submitted to a committee termed the committee of detail the committees assignment was to prepare a draft of the constitution the precise verbiage to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction was not among the  resolutions it was supplied by the committee of detail there is some dispute as to the source of the terminology selected by the committee one legal scholar has implied that the terminology as well as the concept of a federal admiralty jurisdiction was little more than an afterthought of john rutledge of south carolina the chairman of the committee of detail see putnam how the federal courts were given admiralty jurisdiction  corn lq   others argue that such wording was included in earlier drafts of the constitution see robinson admiralty and federalism chapter   whatever the source of its birth might have been the nurture and development of this phase is clearly a product of judicial interpretation admiralty jurisdiction in england was restricted to certain defined and enumerated areas such as civil salvage prize salvage contracts made upon the high seas suits for freights and wages and torts occurring upon the high seas see wiswall fl the development of admiralty jurisdiction and practice since    the early cases in this country involving admiralty jurisdiction adopted the restricted english view see eg waring v clarke  us  how    l ed   nevertheless in de lovio v boit  f cas  ccdmass the restricted english view was forever rejected instead the court concluded that the national policy as well as the juridical logic requires the clause of the constitution to be construed so as to embrace all maritime contracts torts and injuries id at  admiralty jurisdiction since de lovio v boit has been extended to all maritime contracts and torts rather than certain select ones as was the case in england but the question remained when was a contract or tort maritime this was grist for subsequent courts to mill with regard to contracts the courts fashioned the rule based on subject matter if the subject matter of the contract involved maritime activities or commerce the contract was generally considered a maritime contract for example contracts concerning the loading or the offloading of cargo to and from ships or the lease of containers for use in ocean transportation or a contract to repair a ship are considered maritime wherever they are negotiated and signed see pillsbury flour mills co v interlake ss co  fd   d cir cticontainer leasing corp v oceanic operations corp  fd  d cir new bedford dry dock co v purdy  us   s ct   l ed    with regard to torts however a different rule evolved the early cases moved toward the acceptance of a locality test under this test a tort which occurred in a certain locality was considered a maritime tort nothing more was required the locality originally extended only to the sea and to the tidewaters that is to say the waters affected by the ebb and flow of the tide see the steamboat thomas jefferson  us  wheat   l ed   the steamboat orleans v phoebus  us  pet   l ed   in genesee chief  us  how   l ed   this tidewater restriction was rejected in favor of a broader locality the genesee chief arose as a result of a collision between the schooner cuba and the steam vessel genesee chief on lake ontario the court held that the incident was within the admiralty jurisdiction subsequent courts interpreted this case to establish the principle that admiralty jurisdiction was not limited to the tidewaters but extended to all navigable bodies of water see eg fretz v jc bull  co  us  how    l ed   the eagle  us  wall   l ed   once this principle was established future courts began the task of defining navigability without geographical restrictions the general rule was summarized by the daniel ball  us  wall    l ed   navigable waters are those that form in their ordinary condition by themselves or by uniting with other waters a continued highway over which commerce is or may be carried on with other states or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water the courts have tended to liberally construe the requirements of navigability see eg guynn an analysis of navigable waters of the united states  baylor lrev   gilmore  black the law of admiralty  foundation press   navigable waters came to include any body of water which has some however remote unfettered access to a sea lake or even river see sanders v placid oil co  fd  th cir  the daniel ball  us  wall  l ed   ex parte boyer  us   s ct   l ed   under the locality test therefore a tort which occurred on navigable waters was a maritime tort and therefore within the admiralty jurisdiction whether or not it involved maritime activity or commerce see eg benazet v atlantic coast line rr co  fd  d cir weinstein v eastern airlines  fd  d cir wilson v transocean airlines  f supp  ndcal notwithstanding the degree of certainty and predictability which the locality test afforded doubts began to be expressed as to the advisability of a jurisdictional rule for maritime torts based entirely upon the situs of the injury or damages an early expression of concern over the strict locality rule was voiced by benedict in his treatise on admiralty after setting forth a summary of the locality rule benedict went on to say it has nevertheless been doubted whether the civil admiralty jurisdiction in cases of tort does not depend upon the relation of the parties to some ship or vessel and embrace only those tortuous violations of maritime right and duty which occur in relation to vessels to which the admiralty jurisdiction and cases of contract apply  benedict admiralty §  at  th ed emphasis supplied this comment became known as mr benedicts celebrated doubt mcguire v city of new york  f supp   sdny the first judicial expression of mr benedicts celebrated doubt appeared in campbell v h hackfield   co  f  th cir in campbell an employee sued his employer for injuries sustained while unloading cargo the court of appeals for the ninth circuit concluded that the employees cause of action was not within the admiralty jurisdiction the fundamental principle underlying all cases of tort as well as contract is that to bring a case within the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty maritime relations of some sort must exist for the all sufficient reason that the admiralty does not concern itself with non maritime affairs id at  congress as well as the courts began pushing the limits of the locality rule for example the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act  uscapp §  extended admiralty jurisdiction to damage on land caused by a vessel on navigable waters maintenance and cure a general maritime law remedy was expanded to include injuries which occurred on land as long as the crew member was under ship articles or in the ships employ odonnell v great lakes dredge  dock co  us   s ct   l ed   the warranty of seaworthiness a general maritime law remedy was extended to injuries which occurred over land gutierrez v waterman ss corp  us   s ct   l ed d   the admiralty jurisdiction over a cause of action based on the jones act was held to depend not on the place where the injury occurs but on the nature of the seamans service swanson v marra bros inc  us   s ct   l ed   by  the locality rule had been weakened by judicial and legislative exceptions in a less complicated time perhaps the rule was effective and even just in a simplier society the only activity conducted on or over navigable water was maritime in nature but with the advent of movable offshore drilling rigs airplanes river boat casinos water skis and other modern modes of transportation or recreation the situation changed it was appropriate for the supreme court to focus on the applicability of the locality rule in our modern society executive jet aviation inc v city of cleveland  us   s ct   l ed d   afforded the court this opportunity in executive jet an airplane struck a flock of sea gulls as it was taking off from a lakefront airport in cleveland ohio as a result the plane lost its power and hit a portion of the airport fence and then settled in lake erie just off the end of the runway the plane was departing cleveland on a charter flight to portland maine there were no personal injuries but the aircraft soon sank and became a total loss in invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction the owner of the aircraft filed suit for property damage alleging that the crash was caused by the citys negligent failure to keep the runway free from the birds or to give warning of their presence since the plane landed in navigable waters the site of the damage the plaintiff alleged the applicability of the general maritime law the lower court dismissed the case on the ground that it was not within the admiralty jurisdiction the supreme court met the jurisdictional issue head on there has existed over the years a judicial legislative and scholarly recognition that in determining whether there is admiralty jurisdiction over a particular tort or class of torts reliance on the relationship of the wrong to traditional maritime activity is often more sensible and more consonant with the purposes of maritime law than is a purely mechanical application of the locality test one area in which locality as the  exclusive test of admiralty tort jurisdiction has given rise to serious problems in application is that of aviation for the reason discussed above and those to be discussed we have concluded that maritime locality alone is not a sufficient predicate for admiralty jurisdiction in aviation cases id at   s ct  concluding the court observed it is far more consistent with the history and purpose of admiralty to require also that the wrong bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity id at   s ct  the court in executive jet jettisoned the locality rule and in its place substituted what has been termed the locality plus rule under this rule for admiralty jurisdiction to apply the wrong must occur on navigable waters plus it must bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity although the executive jet ruling discussed aviation the new rule was quickly applied to all cases of maritime jurisdiction see kelly v smith  fd  th cir peytavin v government employees ins co  fd th cir after executive jet both a maritime locus and a maritime nexus was required locus was easy to determine nexus proved a bit harder the task of future courts in applying this rule was in determining what constituted a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity a trilogy of later supreme court cases defined the scope of the executive jet courts new test for admiralty jurisdiction the first case foremost ins co v richardson  us   s ct   l ed d   concerned claims arising out of the collision between two pleasure boats on navigable waters that resulted in the death of one of the boats occupants the district court found that neither of the pleasure boats involved in the collision had ever been used in a commercial context and that since the vast majority of traditional maritime activities was commercial in nature this precluded admiralty jurisdiction richardson v foremost ins co  f supp  mdla the court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed recognizing that two boats traversing navigable waters are engaged in a traditional maritime activity when a collision occurs between them since regardless of their size or purpose boats are governed by the same rules of the road see richardson v foremost ins co  fd  th cir in upholding the court of appeals findings the supreme court expressly refuted the assertion that a commercial flavor is required for a maritime activity to satisfy the executive jet nexus requirement foremost ins co  us at   s ct  the court instead held that jurisdiction existed because of the potential disruptive impact such a collision may have on maritime commerce coupled with the traditional concern of admiralty courts over navigation see id at   s ct  the court further noted that the inquiry focused on the relationship of the alleged wrong to maritime commerce id at   s ct  the court again addressed the issue of admiralty jurisdiction in sisson v ruby  us   s ct   l ed d   this case concerned tort claims filed after a fire which was caused by a defective washer dryer aboard a yacht docked at a marina and burned the yacht as well as nearby boats and the marina itself the court began its analysis looking to the twoprong test of foremost the potential disruptive impact on maritime commerce and an activity bearing a substantial relationship to maritime commerce id at   s ct  considering the impact on maritime commerce the court concluded that the proper  analysis must focus on the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether such an incident is likely to disrupt commercial activity id at   s ct  considering the facts before it the court held that a fire aboard a vessel docked at a marina was a potential disruption to maritime commerce turning to the substantial relationship prong of the test the court in sisson defined the relevant activity not by the particular circumstances of the incident but by the general conduct from which the incident arose id at   s ct  thus the court determined that the relevant activity in that case was the storage and maintenance of a vessel on navigable waters id at   s ct  the court then looked to the definition of traditional maritime activity and concluded that its definition extended at least to any other activities traditionally undertaken by vessels commercial or noncommercial id at   s ct  docking a vessel at a marina on navigable waters was held to be an essential maritime activity which brought the case within the courts admiralty jurisdiction id the final case in this trilogy is jerome b grubart inc v great lakes dredge  dock co  us   s ct   l ed d   which held that admiralty jurisdiction extends to claims for damages caused by a vessels pile driving activities in the chicago river which weakened underground tunnels causing water to flood into the basements of several chicago buildings the court held that the first prong of the inquiry turned on a description of the incident at an intermediate level of possible generality which the court described as damage by a vessel in navigation to an underwater structure id at   s ct  turning the second inquiry the court defined as asking whether a tortfeasors activity commercial or noncommercial on navigable waters is so closely related to activity traditionally subject to admiralty law that the reasons for applying special admiralty rules would apply in the suit at hand id at   s ct  the court concluded that this test was met because the case before it concerned maintenance work being done on a navigable waterway performed by a vessel in navigation the cases cited above have established a two part test for determining a maritime nexus sufficient to establish maritime jurisdiction first a court must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce second the court must examine the general conduct from which the incident arose to determine whether there is a substantial relationship between the activity giving rise to the incident and traditional maritime activity one admiralty scholar has noted that the two part test is designed to operate as a policybased filter that allows the courts flexibility in screening out unusual fact situations that are not maritime in nature but happen to occur in navigable waters thomas j schoenbaum admiralty and maritime law §  at  d ed in the present case the undisputed facts are that the plaintiff at the time of his injury was removing carpet true his title was captain of the treasure chest but in truth he was a captain in name only his vessel has been beached he has no captain duties while the treasure chest is being used as a gambling site the purpose for which it was built and operated what he was doing at the time of his injuryremoving carpethad no potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce and has no substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity thus this plaintiff while satisfying the locus aspect of the test fails to meet the  nexus aspect and consequently the matter is not within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court iii conclusion for the reasons set forth above the court finds as a matter of law that the treasure chest is not a vessel in navigation and the plaintiffs claim is not within the admiralty jurisdiction accordingly it is ordered that the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment is denied and the defendants motion for summary judgment is granted it is further ordered that the plaintiffs claims be dismissed with prejudice notes  the pavone court relied on a trilogy of previous fifth circuit cases to reach its holding bernard v binnings construction co  fd  th cir  ducrepont v baton rouge marine enters inc  fd  th cir  and gremillion v gulf coast catering co  fd  th cir  bernard found that a work punt was not a vessel because it was not designed for navigation was not engaged in the business of navigation and was not actually in navigation at the time of plaintiffs injuries bernard  fd at  ducrepont held that a barge used as a work platform although originally constructed for use as a vessel was not a vessel at the time of the accident because it was moored at the time of the accident and any transportation function it performed was incidental to its primary purpose of acting as a work platform ducrepont  fd at  finally gremillion determined that a barge used to house offshore workers that was spudded down to the bay floor on one side and moored to the shore on the other side was not a vessel because it was not designed for navigation and its primary purpose was to provide a living facility gremillion  fd at   the court was careful to point out however that this was not a determinative factor following the logic of ducrepont pavone  fd at   plaintiff also refers this court to its previous holding in dalleo v treasure chest casino llc in which the issue of vessel status of the casino was argued the court at that time denied the defendants motion for summary judgment but the case settled before the court assigned reasons some of the issues presented in dalleo were different from the present case and the court is not persuaded by the plaintiffs reliance on that case treasure chest casino llc  kenner louisiana treasure chest

judge treasure chest casino llc treasure chest appeals from an interlocutory order of the district court certifying under federal rule of civil procedure b a plaintiff class consisting of injured treasure chest employees we affirm the district courts class certification i background the appellees dennis mullen sheila bachemin and margaret phipps collectively the named plaintiffs are former employees of the mv treasure chest casino the casino a floating casino owned and operated out of kenner louisiana by appellant treasure chest mullen was an assistant pit boss bachemin was a dealer and phipps was employed as a slotfloor person and dealer each named plaintiff has suffered respiratory illness allegedly caused by the casinos defective andor improperly maintained airconditioning and ventilating system each was diagnosed with asthma and bronchitis while employed aboard the casino mullen and bachemin while aboard the casino suffered respiratory attacks requiring hospitalization kathleen mcnamara the named plaintiffs physician testified in a deposition that as many as half of the  casino employees that she had treated suffered from similar respiratory problems she attributed the named plaintiffs and other crew members maladies to extremely smoky conditions in the casino in january  the named plaintiffs filed suit against treasure chest making jones act unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure claims they sought rule  certification of a class consisting of all members of the crew of the mv treasure chest casino who have been stricken with occupational respiratory illness caused by or exacerbated by the defective ventilation system in place aboard the vessel the parties conducted precertification discovery that included deposing the named plaintiffs dr mcnamara and two other physicians the parties then briefed the district court which heard arguments in july  on august   the district court certified the proposed class under rule b under the courts plan the liability issues common to all class members will be tried together in an initial trial phase those common issues include whether the employees of the casino are seamen within the meaning of the jones act whether the casino is a vessel within the meaning of the jones act whether the casino was rendered unseaworthy by the air quality aboard and whether treasure chest was negligent in relation to the casinos ventilation system if the class prevails on the common liability issues in phase one the issues affecting only individual class members will be tried in a second phase in waves of approximately five class members at a time these limited issues include causation damages and comparative negligence treasure chest sought to appeal the class certification order and the district court certified the issue for interlocutory appeal under  usc § b we granted treasure chest permission to appeal ii discussion a class may be certified under rule b only if it meets the four prerequisites found in rule a and the two additional requirements found in rule b the four a prerequisites include  numerosity a class so large that joinder of all members is impracticable  commonality questions of law or fact common to the class  typicality named parties claims or defenses are typical of the class and  adequacy of representation representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class amchem products inc v windsor  us   sct    ledd   the two b requirements are predominance and superiority common questions must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and class resolution must be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy id  sct at  quoting fedrcivp b treasure chest argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding any of the rule  requirements satisfied before evaluating the six requirements seriatim we note that the district court maintains great discretion in certifying and managing a class action see montelongo v meese  fd   th cir we will reverse a district courts decision to certify a class only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion see jenkins v raymark industries  fd   th cir or that it applied incorrect legal standards in reaching its decision see forbush v jc penney co  fd   th cir a numerosity the court found that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable fedrcivp a referring to three factors first the class would likely consist of between  and  members second owing to the transient nature of employment in the gambling business it was likely that some of the putative class members were geographically dispersed and unavailable for joinder third putative class members still employed by the casino might be reluctant to file individually for fear of workplace retaliation treasure chest challenges only the second of the district courts three reasons it asserts that the district courts claim that class members would be geographically dispersed was unsupported by evidence they reference the courts own comment that the plaintiff has not introduced any specific evidence that there are potential class members that have moved out of the area we find no abuse of discretion in the district courts finding of numerosity although the number of members in a proposed class is not determinative of whether joinder is impracticable see zeidman v j ray mcdermott  co  fd   th cir the size of the class in this case— to  members — is within the range that generally satisfies the numerosity requirement see  newberg on class actions §  at  d ed suggesting that any class consisting of more than forty members should raise a presumption that joinder is impracticable cf boykin v georgiapacific corp  fd   th cir finding that numerosity requirement would not be met by a class with  members but was met by a class with  members furthermore the additional factors mentioned by the district court support its finding of numerosity see zeidman  fd at  discussing relevant factors including for example the geographical dispersion of the class the ease with which class members may be identified the nature of the action and the size of each plaintiffs claim notwithstanding the lack of any direct evidence the district court reasonably inferred from the nature of the putative class members employment that some of them would be geographically dispersed it also reasonably presumed that those potential class members still employed by treasure chest might be unwilling to sue individually or join a suit for fear of retaliation at their jobs based upon those considerations it was within the district courts discretion to find that joinder of all  to  class members would be impracticable b commonality the district court found that there are questions of law or fact common to the class fedrcivp a on the basis of the class members identical theories of liability their common claims under the jones act and their uniform allegations of suffering injury from secondhand smoke treasure chest challenges the district courts assertion that all plaintiffs claims relate to secondhand smoke the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding commonality the test for commonality is not demanding and is met where there is at least one issue the resolution of which will affect all or a significant number of the putative class members lightbourn v county of el paso  fd   th cir in this case the putative class members will assert claims for negligence under the jones act and for operating an unseaworthy vessel the common issues pertaining to these theories of liability — ie the class members status as jones act seamen the negligence of treasure chest and the unseaworthiness of the casino — are independently sufficient to establish commonality it is therefore irrelevant whether the class members uniformly allege damages from secondhand smoke c typicality the district found the the claims or defenses of the parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class fedrcivp a because the named plaintiffs and the class members by definition all allege to have suffered occupationrelated respiratory illness treasure chest contends that the named plaintiffs claims are not typical of the class because a wide array of claims could fall under the respiratory illness category we find no abuse in the district courts finding of typicality like commonality the test for typicality is not demanding it focuses on the similarity between the named plaintiffs legal and remedial theories and the theories of those whom they purport to represent lightbourn  fd at  in this case the named plaintiffs and the proposed class members legal and remedial theories appear to be exactly the same the class complaint indicates that they will all premise liability for the casinos defective air ventilation system under the jones act and the doctrine of seaworthiness any variety in the illnesses the named plaintiffs and the class members suffered will not affect their legal or remedial theories and thus does not defeat typicality d adequacy of representation the district court stated that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class fedrcivp a because the named plaintiffs interests are identical to the interests of the proposed class and their attorneys have extensive experience litigating class actions and jones act cases treasure chest argues on the appeal that the district courts finding was erroneous because the named plaintiffs and the class members have suffered from varied illnesses and have varying susceptibilities to respiratory ailments we find no abuse of discretion in the district courts finding differences between named plaintiffs and class members render the named plaintiffs inadequate representatives only if those differences create conflicts between the named plaintiffs interests and the class members interests see jenkins v raymark industries inc  fd   th cir considering whether named plaintiffs have an insufficient stake in the outcome or interests antagonistic to the unnamed members in evaluating adequate representation requirement the differences described by treasure chest may create variances in the ways that the named plaintiffs and class members will prove causation and damages a class member who has never smoked for example may have less difficulty in proving that the conditions inside the casino caused her asthma than will bachemin who has a history of smoking and whose claim may be subject to a defense of contributory negligence such a difference however does not affect the alignment of their interests nothing indicates that the class members will be inadequately represented by the named plaintiffs and their counsel e predominance we see no abuse in the district courts finding that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members fedrcivp b in order to predominate common issues must constitute a significant part of the individual cases jenkins  fd at  the district court held that the issues to be tried commonly — seamen status vessel status negligence and seaworthiness — were significant in relation to the individual issues of causation damages and contributory negligence treasure chest argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by failing to weigh the common against the individual issues and by improperly finding causation to be a common issue treasure chests arguments are without merit first although the courts predominance inquiry was not lengthy there is no indication that the court limited its inquiry to counting issues instead of weighing them second explicit in the district courts decision is a finding that causation is a unique issue that will be resolved in the trial plans secondphase individual trials even examining the district courts predominance analysis more closely we find no abuse the common issues in this case especially negligence and seaworthiness are not only significant but also pivotal they will undoubtedly require the parties to produce extensive evidence regarding the casinos air ventilation system as well as testimony concerning treasure chests knowledge of and response to the casino employees respiratory problems and complaints the phaseone jury will have the difficult task of determining whether the air quality aboard the casino resulted from a negligent breach of treasure chests duty to its employees or rendered the casino unseaworthy if treasure chest prevails on those two issues alone they will prevail in the case moreover this case does not involve the type of individuated issues that have in the past led courts to find predominance lacking for example in amchem products inc v windsor  us   sct   ledd   the supreme court found that common issues did not predominate where the members of the plaintiff class were exposed to asbestoscontaining products from different sources over different time periods some of the class members were asymptomatic while others had developed illnesses and the class members were from a variety of states requiring the application of a multitude of different legal standards see id  sct at  citing georgine v amchem products inc  fd   d cir similarly in castano v american tobacco co  fd  th cir this court found that a putative class of addicted smokers did not meet the predominance requirement because there were complex choiceoflaw issues and the case involved novel addictionasinjury claims with no track record from which a court could determine which issues were significant see id at  here by contrast the putative class members are all symptomatic by definition and claim injury from the same defective ventilation system over the same general period of time because all of the claims are under federal law there are no individual choiceoflaw issues and because negligence and doctrineofseaworthiness claims are timetested bases for liability the district court could reasonably evaluate the significance of the common issues without first establishing a track record f superiority we also find no abuse of discretion in the district courts finding that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy fedrcivp b the district court based its superiority finding on the fact that the class litigation in this case would not present the degree of managerial complexities that prompted this court to decertify the putative class in castano specifically the district court mentioned the lack of any complex choiceoflaw or erie problems and that the class would consist of only hundreds instead of millions of members the bifurcatedtrial plan the court found would promote judicial economy and avoid the wasteful duplicative litigation which would inevitably result if these cases were tried individually treasure chest argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing adequately to consider how a trial on the merits would be conducted it contends that because the named plaintiffs describe somewhat different causes for their ailments a phaseone judgment of negligence or unseaworthiness related solely to tobacco smoke would be inadequate insofar as it would preclude plaintiffs from recovering for ailments that were caused by sources other than tobacco smoke in the phasetwo trials we find no merit in treasure chests argument first treasure chest overstates the importance of the named plaintiffs conjecture regarding their own illnesses it is true that in addition to making secondhand smoke complaints dennis mullen has complained about the temperature aboard the casino sheila bachemin has described one incident where paint fumes on the casino kicked in her asthma and margaret phipps has stated that her asthma might have been caused by dust on the air vents or germs on the radios used by multiple casino employees as lay witnesses however the named plaintiffs opinions about the possible causes of their own respiratory conditions are of negligible evidentiary weight and probably would not be admissible at trial see fedrevid  limiting admissibility of nonexpert opinion testimony doddy v oxy usa inc  fd   th cir a person may testify as a lay witness only if his opinions or inferences do not require any specialized knowledge and could be reached by any ordinary person henry v as ocean  fd   d cir finding that the plaintiff in a jones act suit was properly prevented from testifying to his opinion that his persistent colds and skin rash had been caused by an accident in which he was knocked overboard the medical experts already deposed in this case have unwaveringly cited excessive secondhand smoke as the most likely casinorelated factor to have exacerbated or caused the putative class members respiratory problems it is thus likely that the trial will focus on excessive secondhand smoke as both the effect of the defective ventilation system and the cause of the putative class members respiratory problems furthermore even if the class does claim at trial that the casinos ventilation system was defective in relation to more than tobacco smoke we are confident that the district court can ably manage this case as a class action our precedent limits a negligent partys liability to injuries that are caused by the same condition that rendered the party negligent see gavagan v united states  fd   th cir the court can easily abide by this precedent by instructing the jury to answer special verdicts finding whether the treasure chest was negligent or the casino was unseaworthy as to each alleged causal agent ie tobacco smoke dust mites fungi paint fumes et cetera the court can then properly limit the injuries for which the phasetwo juries could find treasure chest liable thus if the phaseone jury were to find that treasure chest was negligent as to tobacco smoke but not as to paint fumes any class member whose injuries were found by a phasetwo jury to be caused by paint fumes would be unable to recover even though rendering multiple special verdicts would complicate the task for the phaseone jury and the court we would see no abuse in the district courts finding such a process superior to conducting duplicative individual trials we also agree with the district court that none of the superiority concerns raised by our decision in castano requires a different result there many of the manageability problems stemmed from the millionperson class membership the complex choiceoflaw issues the novel addictionasinjury cause of action and the extensive subclassing requirements as already discussed none of those problems exist in this case in fact unlike the frankensteins monster feared in castano  fd at  n  this class is akin to other bifurcated class actions this court has approved see watson v shell oil co  fd  th cir finding no abuse in the district courts certification of a bifurcated class action arising from an oil refinery explosion where liability and punitive damages would be resolved commonly and injury causation and actual damages would be resolved individually jenkins  fd  finding no abuse of discretion in district courts certification of a bifurcated class action where asbestos producers state of the art defense as well as product identification product defectiveness negligence and punitive damages would be resolved commonly and causation actual damages and comparative fault would tried individually hernandez v motor vessel skyward  frd  sdfla affd  fd  th cir unpublished certifying bifurcated class action on behalf of  passengers who were fed contaminated food aboard cruise ship where negligence would be tried commonly and causation and damages would be tried individually in castano this court expressed a concern that having one jury consider the defendants conduct and another consider the plaintiffs comparative negligence could create seventh amendment problems see castano  fd at  citing in re rhonepoulenc rorer inc  fd   th cir this does not change our view of the district courts superiority finding treasure chest did not raise this issue to the district court nor has it been argued on appeal we are reluctant to find that the district abused its discretion by failing to consider an issue that was not raised by the parties in any case we would not find the risk of infringing upon the parties seventh amendment rights significant in this case the seventh amendment does not prohibit bifurcation of trials as long as the the judge does not divide issues between separate trials in such a way that the same issue is reexamined by different juries cimino v raymark industries inc  fd   n  th cir quoting rhonepoulenc  fd at  see alabama v blue bird body co inc  fd   th cir in castano we were concerned that allowing a second jury to consider the plaintiffs comparative negligence would invite that jury to reconsider the first jurys findings concerning the defendants conduct we believe that such a risk has been avoided here by leaving all issues of causation for the phasetwo jury when a jury considers the comparative negligence of a plaintiff the focus is upon causation it is inevitable that a comparison of the conduct of plaintiffs and defendants ultimately be in terms of causation lewis v timco inc  fd   th cir en banc see id permitting the use of comparative negligence in strict liability claims thus in considering comparative negligence the phasetwo jury would not be reconsidering the first jurys findings of whether treasure chests conduct was negligent or the casino unseaworthy but only the degree to which those conditions were the sole or contributing cause of the class members injury because the first jury will not be considering any issues of causation no seventh amendment implications affect our review of the district courts superiority finding iii conclusion for the foregoing reasons we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying under rule b a class of all casino employees stricken with occupationrelated respiratory illnesses affirmed emilio m garza circuit judge dissenting treasure chest casino llc treasure chest appeals the district courts order granting class certification under federal rule of civil procedure b the majority affirms finding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs class satisfies the requirements of rule  i respectfully dissent i plaintiffs dennis mullen sheila bachemin and margaret phipps are crew members of the mv treasure chest casino casino a vessel owned and operated by treasure chest in kenner louisiana they allege that they suffered respiratory illnesses as a result of inadequate ventilation aboard the vessel according to the district court the plaintiffs attribute their illnesses to secondhand smoke aboard the casino however the record indicates that the plaintiffs allege other causes as well in her deposition phipps complains of dust on the air vents and germs on the employee radios and does not attribute her illness to secondhand smoke mullen who does complain of excessive smoke aboard the casino also states in his deposition that his illness may have stemmed from the casinos temperature being too hot or too cold bachemin complains of secondhand smoke but she testifies about excessive paint fumes as well these plaintiffs sued treasure chest on behalf of themselves and persons similarly situated for negligence under the jones act  uscapp §  for operating an unseaworthy vessel and for failing to provide maintenance and cure they moved to certify a class action under rule b the district court certified a class consisting of all members of the crew of the mv treasure chest casino who have been stricken with occupational respiratory illness caused by or exacerbated by the defective ventilation system in place aboard the vessel treasure chest now appeals ii federal rule of civil procedure a sets forth four prerequisites for all class actions  numerosity a class so large that joinder of all members is impracticable  commonality questions of law or fact common to the class  typicality named parties claims or defenses are typical of the class and  adequacy of representation representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class amchem prods v windsor  us    sct    ledd   quotation marks omitted once the criteria of rule a are met a party must show that class treatment is appropriate under one of the three categories enumerated in rule b see id at   sct at  rule b under which this class was certified demands that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy fedr civ p b these requirements are commonly referred to as predominance and superiority see amchem  us at   sct at  rule b applies to cases for which a class action would achieve economies of time effort and expense and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results id quotations omitted the district court concluded that the plaintiffs class satisfied rule as requirements of numerosity commonality typicality and adequacy of representation it also found that common issues of law and fact predominated over individual issues the district court identified as common issues  whether casino employees are seamen within the meaning of the jones act  whether the casino is a vessel within the meaning of the jones act  whether the casino was unseaworthy and  whether the casinos ventilation system was unreasonably suited to protect the class members from harm it classified contributory negligence damages and causation as individual issues finally the district court ruled that a class action was superior to other available methods of adjudicating the proposed class members claims in doing so the district court relied on the plaintiffs proposed trial plan which provided the class action would include an initial phase in which the liability issues common to all plaintiffs would be tried together later if plaintiffs prevailed on liability the unique issues such as damages and causation if necessary would be tried in waves of approximately five plaintiffs at a time the district court reasoned that this approach will promote judicial economy and avoid the wasteful duplicative litigation which would inevitably result if these cases were tried individually iii a district court has wide discretion in deciding whether to certify a proposed class lightbourn v county of el paso  fd   th cir we may reverse its decision only for abuse of discretion see id treasure chest contends that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the proposed class satisfied rule  according to treasure chest the plaintiffs class lacks numerosity commonality typicality and adequacy of representation and fails to satisfy rule bs predominance and superiority requirements the majority examines these six requirements and concludes that the district court did not abuse its discretion under the law of our circuit however the district court abused its discretion in finding that a class action was superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy fed r civ p b a courts inquiry into superiority requires an understanding of the relevant claims defenses facts and substantive law presented in the case allison v citgo petroleum corp  fd   th cir see also fed r civ p b requiring that in assessing whether class treatment is superior a court must consider the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action it is an abuse of discretion to certify a class without adequately considering how a trial on the alleged causes of action would be tried castano v american tobacco co  fd   th cir cf kentucky fried chicken corp v diversified packaging corp  fd   th cir the district courts failure to consider the appropriate factors constitutes an abuse of discretion the district court certified a class of all casino employees who were stricken with occupational respiratory illness caused by or exacerbated by the defective ventilation system to prevail these plaintiffs must prove both negligent breach of duty and proximate cause see gavagan v united states  fd   n  th cir under the trial plan the issue of whether the ventilation system of the mv treasure chest casino was unreasonably suited to protect the proposed class members from harm will be tried as a common issue to a class jury however the issue of proximate cause will be tried as an individual issue to individual juries in upholding the district courts bifurcated approach to these two issues the majority relies on three cases in which we allowed a district court to try the issue of negligence separately from the issue of proximate cause see watson v shell oil co  fd  th cir jenkins v raymark industries inc  fd  th cir hernandez v motor vessel skyward  fd  th cir unpublished in general of course district courts have the authority to bifurcate a trial trying some issues on a class basis and others individually see fed r civ p ca authorizing class treatment with respect to particular issues fed r civ p b authorizing separate trials for separate issues however in all of the cases cited by the majority the class members injuries stemmed from a single hazard in the instant case the class members attribute their various ailments to different aspects of the air aboard the casino mullen and bachemin complain of secondhand smoke whereas phipps complains only of dust on air vents and germs on employee radios mullen additionally points to the casinos temperature bachemin complains of paint fumes the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the difficulties posed by the plaintiffs divers allegations in a negligence case a defendant owes a duty only with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous gavagan  fd at  emphasis omitted quoting  harper james  gray §  at  in other words a defendant is liable for negligence only when the plaintiffs injuries are caused by the same conditions that render the defendants conduct negligent this principle is important to consider because in this case different plaintiffs allege different risks or hazards id for example if the class jury finds the ventilation system negligent because of excessive smoke a plaintiff should not be able to recover for injuries caused by dust or germs if it finds the ventilation system negligent solely because of high levels of dust or germs plaintiffs should not be able to recover for injuries caused by smoke temperature or paint fumes the district courts trial plan fails to account for the fact that the plaintiffs allege a variety of different risks or hazards there is nothing in the trial plan to ensure that the hazards found by the class jury to constitute negligence are the same hazards based on which the individual juries would determine proximate cause put simply an individual jury might award damages caused by smoke even though the class jury found treasure chest liable only as to excessive dust or germs this sort of mixandmatch verdict simply does not satisfy the elements of negligence because it would hold treasure chest liable for hazards that were never found to constitute a negligent breach of duty the district court failed to consider the potential for its bifurcated approach to yield such illegitimate verdicts of course the risk of unjustified verdicts could be avoided if the individual juries determined for themselves whether a given plaintiffs injuries were caused by those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous id to do so however the individual juries would be required to make essentially the same inquiry made by the class jury that is whether the hazards posed by the casinos ventilation system unreasonably failed to protect the plaintiffs from harm this overlap between the issues decided by the class jury and the individual juries impacts a courts superiority inquiry for two reasons first it may eviscerate one of the primary rationales for class treatment — judicial efficiency see castano  fd at  where the class jury and the individual juries must consider similar issues it is likely that evidence presented at the class trial will be repeated during the individual trials see id as we have noted the net result may be a waste not a savings in judicial resources id second having separate juries consider essentially the same issue may run afoul of the seventh amendment inherent in the seventh amendment guarantee of a trial by jury is the general right of a litigant to have only one jury pass on a common issue of fact alabama v blue bird body co  fd   th cir see us const amend vii no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the united states therefore a court may try a certain issue to a different jury only when that issue is distinct and separable from the others blue bird body  fd at  such a rule is dictated for the very practical reason that if separate juries are allowed to pass on issues involving overlapping legal and factual questions the verdicts rendered by each jury could be inconsistent id when the bifurcation of class and individual issues risks improper reconsideration of issues assigned to the classwide jury appellate courts have not hesitated to decertify the class see castano  fd at  in re rhonepoulenc rorer inc  fd   th cir these same concerns — judicial efficiency and the seventh amendment — are also implicated by the district courts plan to handle the issue of comparative negligence under the trial plan comparative negligence will be considered by the individual juries whereas the casinos negligence will be considered by the class jury these two issues are too closely related to allow bifurcated treatment comparative negligence by definition requires a comparison between the defendants and the plaintiffs conduct castano  fd at  see also rhonepoulenc  fd at  therefore to properly try the issue of comparative negligence the parties may need to repeat evidence concerning the casinos conduct that was already presented to the class jury see castano  fd at  furthermore in comparing the negligent conduct of the casino with the negligent conduct of each plaintiff the individual juries may impermissibly reconsider the class jurys determination as to the casinos negligence in violation of the seventh amendment id see also rhonepoulenc  fd at  accordingly class treatment can hardly be said to be superior to individual adjudication castano  fd at  finding that a bifurcated class action failed rule bs superiority requirement where the district court planned to try the issues of negligence and comparative negligence to separate juries iv the district court in this case failed to consider the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action fed r civ p b specifically it did not address how the disparate hazards alleged by each plaintiff impact whether bifurcated class treatment is feasible this failure to adequately examine how a trial on the alleged causes of action would be tried constitutes an abuse of discretion and requires that we vacate the class certification order castano  fd at  accordingly i dissent footnotes  treasure chest also argues on appeal that implicit in rule  is an additional requirement that any class must be capable of objective identification before it can be certified it contends that because being a member of the class in this case is contingent upon ultimate issues of causation ie whether the class members illness was caused or exacerbated by the defective ventilation system treasure chest is prejudiced by being forced to defend against claimants who may not end up being members of the class this same argument was already rejected by this court in forbush v jc penney co  fd  th cir there we considered a defendants contention that a class of pension beneficiaries was hopelessly circular because membership in the class was defined by the improper reduction of the class members benefits which was also the ultimate issue in the case id at  we found that the defendants argument was meritless and if accepted would preclude certification of just about any class of persons alleging injury from a particular action these persons are linked by this common complaint and the possibility that some may fail to prevail on their individual claims will not defeat class membership id here because the class is similarly linked by a common complaint the fact that the class is defined with reference to an ultimate issue of causation does not prevent certification  the plaintiffs also requested that the district court certify a class under rule b the district court declined to address rule b on the grounds that the plaintiffs raised it for the first time their reply brief on appeal the plaintiffs do not raise rule b as a basis for class certification  because i believe that the plaintiffs class fails the superiority requirement of rule b i would not reach the other issues addressed in the majoritys opinion ie numerosity commonality typicality adequacy of representation and predominance  our opinion in watson is no longer binding precedent on our circuit as we have explained while watson was awaiting rehearing en banc it settled according to the internal operating procedure accompanying th cir r  the effect of granting a rehearing en banc is to vacate the previous opinion and judgment of the court and to stay the mandate castano  fd at  n  quotation marks and citations omitted see watson v shell oil co  fd   th cir en banc  the plaintiffs suggest in a footnote that we should disregard the fact that the disparate sources of illness they allege eg smoke temperature germs dust fumes might preclude class certification they argue that a magistrate judges ruling prevented them from discovering the precise nature of the defects in the ventilation system the magistrates discovery ruling is not before us on appeal even if it could be shown that discovery was insufficient it does not follow that we must approve a class that fails to meet the requirements of rule  rather we must decertify such a class even if further discovery may eventually justify class treatment see alabama v blue bird body co  fd   th cir decertifying class where discovery was insufficient to determine whether common issues existed  the majority suggests that the district court can avert this problem by instructing the class jury to answer special verdicts as to each hazard alleged by the plaintiffs however such special verdicts are not included in the district courts trial plan comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is under no obligation to do so
