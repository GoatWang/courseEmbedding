are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs

opportunities fund returned  i class shares compared to the bloomberg barclays multiverse index return of  for the quarter ended june   exposure to high yield contributed to performance due to a combination of strong fundamentals a good earnings season continued low default rates and supportive technicals investmentgrade debt helped results as the sector posted strong performance after a strong earnings season technicals were favorable due to continued foreign investor demand emerging market debt also contributed partly due to the attractive carry of selective hardlocal currency sovereign bonds the funds government rates exposure detracted as our core view of higher yields in developed markets was challenged particularly in the beginning of the quarter our emerging markets foreign exchange exposure detracted mainly due to political volatility in brazil and underperformance of the russian ruble looking ahead we maintain our expectations that global growth momentum will continue and central bank accommodation will remain supportive for global risk assets in the near term we have a negative view on us duration as we expect a more hawkish fed and a rebound in us growth to drive treasury yields higher by yearend to the  range we are still constructive on spread sectors through investmentgrade and highyield corporates due to positive technicals and credit fundamentals highyield default rates are low and spreads could provide a modest cushion in an environment of rising rates we particularly believe that european bank capital alternative tier  offers improving fundamentals and benefits from continued buying from the ecb we continue to be selective on emerging markets as we are constructive on the general improvement in these developing economies but

international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such

interest rates thus as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates the share price may decline investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size lesser liquidity and lack of established legal political business and social frameworks to support securities markets such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year high yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lowerrated securities and in some cases the lower market prices for these instruments interest rate movements may affect the
