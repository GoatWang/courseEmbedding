widely followed indian guru from the ss – brings up some very interesting and insightful points about the differences between western psychology and eastern spirituality’s approach to changing man osho correctly states that western psychology’s aim is to fortify the individual’s ego so that he may become less neurotic slightly happier and ultimately function ‘better’ in society he says that in the east the goal is instead to dissolve the ego rather than strengthen it it could be said that the neurosis of western man stems from a lifelong repression of almost every natural desire and instinct that we have as a human animal this is a result of our societies many taboos and laws which punish us for thinking or acting outside a certain archetype of a normal healthy person that has been created for us the result is that we are at war with ourselves as we constantly have to police our thoughts and behaviours and those of others around us this is where psychology comes in to iron out any tensions that we may have so we can come out the other side with a stronger ego – to transform from a lower case italicised i to a capitalised bold i osho’s problem with psychology is that it is too concentrated with analysis and not at all with synthesis – it is focused on picking apart analysing and making one a better individual rather than putting together and making one whole and connected with everything you could say that the body mind and spirit are a house and western man is trapped inside it osho believes that the locked door is the ego the key is meditation and that outside is liberation from the self spiritual freedom and self realisation enlightenment osho compares this losing of the ego and becoming enlightened to being a rain drop that falls into the ocean – both become simply water there is no separation below is a transcription of osho’s talk “i don’t give much value to freud jung adler or assagioli freud jung adler and others are just children playing on the sand of time they have gathered beautiful pebbles beautiful colored stones but when you look at the ultimate they are just children playing with pebbles and stones those stones are not real diamonds and whatsoever they have gained is very very primitive you will have to go slowly with me to understand man can be physically ill then the physician the doctor is needed man can be psychologically ill then a little help can be given by freud and jung and others but when man is existentially ill neither a physician nor a psychiatrist can be of any help existential illness is spiritual it is neither of the body nor of the mind it is of the total — and the total transcends all parts the total is not just a composition a composition of the parts it is something beyond the parts it is something that holds all the parts into itself it is a transcendence and the illness is existential man suffers from a spiritual illness dreams won’t be of any help towards that what in fact can dreams do at the most they can help you to understand your unconscious a little bit more dreams are the language of the unconscious the symbols indications hints and gestures of the unconscious a message from the unconscious to the conscious psychoanalysts can help you to interpret the dreams they can become mediators they can tell you what your dream means of course if you can understand your dream you will come a little closer to your unconscious this will help to make you more adjusted with your unconscious you will have a little understanding your two parts the conscious and the unconscious will not be so far apart they will be a little closer you will not be split as much as before a little unity a sort of unity will exist in you you will be more normal but to be normal is nothing to be normal is not even worth talking about to be normal means you are as you should be ordinarily nothing else has happened nothing from the beyond has penetrated you you will be a more adjusted person in the society also of course you will be a little better husband a little better mother a little better friend but only a little but this is not self realization and when jung starts talking about selfrealization through dream analysis he is talking very stupidly it is not selfrealization because self realization comes only when there is no mind dreams interpreted are not interpreted they belong to the mind they are part of the mind and no psychology of the west — except for gurdjieff eckhart and jacob boehme — no psychology of the west goes beyond mind and these few people jacob boehme eckhart and gurdjieff in fact don’t belong to the west they belong to the east their whole standpoint is eastern they are born in the west but their attitude their way of life their very understanding is of the east when i say ‘of the east’ always remember that i don’t mean geographically to me east is a standpoint and west is also a standpoint i am not concerned with geography ‘west’ is a way of looking at things ‘east’ is also a way of looking at things when east looks at things it looks at the total and when west looks at things it always looks at the part the western attitude is analytical — it analyzes the eastern attitude is synthetic — it synthesizes it tries to find the one in the many the western attitude tries to find the many in the one the western attitude has become very efficient in analyzing dissecting taking things apart even a movement like the psychosynthesis of assagioli is not a real synthesis because the very standpoint is missing first freud and jung have taken things apart they have broken the whole and now assagioli is trying to put those parts together somehow you can dissect a man into parts he was alive when you have dissected him he is no longer alive now you can put the parts back again but the life will not come it will be a dead corpse and even parts put together again will not make it a whole what freud and jung did assagioli is simply repenting for he is putting the parts together again but it is a corpse there is no synthesis in it you have to look at the whole and the whole is something totally different now even biologists have become aware even medicine is becoming more and more aware every day that when you take the blood out of a man to examine it it is no longer the same blood that was running through the man because now it is dead you are examining something else the blood circulating in man is alive it belongs to a whole a system it runs through it it is as alive as a hand of the body you cut the hand — it is no longer the same hand how can the blood be the same when you take it out of the body take it to the lab and examine it it is no longer the same blood life exists as a unity and the western standpoint is to dissect to go to the part to understand the part and through the part to try to comprehend the whole you will always miss even if you can comprehend like assagioli then that comprehension will be like a corpse somehow put together but with no living unity in it freud and jung worked with dreams it was a discovery in the west a great discovery in a way because the western mind had completely forgotten about sleep about dreams western man has existed for at least three thousand years without thinking about dreams and about sleep western man has been thinking as if only the waking hours are life but the waking hours are only two thirds if you live sixty years you will be asleep for twenty years one third of life will be in dreams and in sleep it is a big phenomenon it takes one third of your life it will not be simply discarded something is happening there it is part of you and not a small part but a major part freud and jung brought back the concept that man has to be understood through his dreams and his sleep and much has been done along that line but when jung starts thinking that this is something towards self realization then he has gone too far it is good for psychological health it can be helpful but psychological health is not existential health you may be physically healthy you may be psychologically healthy but you may not be existentially healthy at all on the contrary when you are psychologically and physically healthy for the first time you become aware of the existential anxiety of the anguish inside before it you were so occupied with the body and the mind and the illnesses that you couldn’t afford to look at the inward being when everything is set right body functions well mind is not in any trouble suddenly you become aware of the greatest anxiety in the world — the existential the spiritual suddenly you start asking ‘what is the meaning of it all why am i here for what’ this never occurs to an ill man because he is too occupied with the illness first he has to look after the body and then he will think then he has to look after the mind and then he will think body and mind if healthy will allow you for the first time to be really in trouble and that trouble will be spiritual when jung talks about his analytical psychology as a way to self realization he does not know what he is saying he himself is not a self realized man go deep into jung’s life or freud’s life and you will find them ordinary human beings freud got as angry as anybody even more than ordinary people he hated as much as anybody he was jealous so much so that when a fit of jealousy came to him he would fall on the ground and become unconscious this happened many times in freud’s life whenever jealousy would take him he would be so disturbed that he would fall into a swoon a fit this man selfrealized then what about buddha then where will you put buddha freud lived with ordinary human ambition the political mind he was trying to make psychoanalysis a movement just like communism and he tried to control it he tried to control it just like any lenin or stalin even more dominatingly he even declared jung to be his successor — and look at jung’s pictures whenever i have come upon a picture of jung i always look at it very deeply it is a rare thing always look at jung’s pictures you will see everything written on the face the ego look at his nose the eyes the cunningness the anger every illness is written on the face he lived as an ordinary fearridden man he was very afraid of spirits ghosts and very jealous competitive argumentative quarrelsome the west really does not know what selfrealization is so anything becomes a selfrealization the west is not aware of what selfrealization means it means such an absolute silence that it cannot be disturbed by anything such absolute nonbeing how can possessiveness ambition jealousy exist in it with a no mind how can you dominate how can you try to dominate self realization means the complete disappearance of the ego and with the ego everything disappears remember the ego cannot disappear through the interpretation of dreams on the contrary the ego may get stronger be cause the gap between the conscious and the unconscious will be less your ego will be strengthened your mind will be stronger the less trouble there is in the mind the more strong mind will be you will have a new lease for the ego so what psychoanalysis can do is to make your ego more grounded more centered to make your ego stronger more confident of course you wilt be able to exist in the world better than before because the world believes in the ego you will be more able to fight in the struggle for survival you will be more confident about your self less nervous you will be able to achieve a few ambitions more easily than if you were troubled inside and the unconscious and conscious were in a constant quarrel within but this is not self realization on the contrary it is ego realization the whole western psychology up to now has not come to the point of nonego it is still thinking in terms of the ego how to make the ego more strongly rooted centered how to make the ego more healthy normal adjusted the east takes the ego itself as the disease the whole mind is the disease there is no choice about it — conscious and unconscious both have to go they have to go and that’s why the east has not tried to interpret because if something has to go why bother about its interpretation why waste time it can be dropped look at the difference the west is somehow trying to make an adjustment between the conscious and the unconscious and strengthen the ego so that you become a more adjusted member of society and also a more adjusted individual inside with the rift bridged you will be more at ease with the mind the east has been trying to drop the mind to go beyond it it is not a question of adjustment to the society it is a question of adjustment to existence itself it is not a question of an adjustment between the conscious and unconscious it is a question of the adjustment of all the parts that constitute your whole being dreams are important if a man is ill dreams are important they show symptoms of the illness but you don’t know about the man who has no dreams dreaming is a pathology in itself dream itself is pathology buddha never dreamed what would freud have done if freud had been there what would he have done with a buddha what would he have interpreted about him — there was nothing to interpret if freud had gone inside buddha he would not have found anything to interpret his whole psychology would have been absolutely useless it happened that in america there was a man who was very very efficient in reading other people’s thoughts — a mindreader he was always a hundred percent right he would sit before you you would close your eyes and start thinking and he would close his eyes and start talking about what you were thinking immediately that you would think the thought would be transferred and he would receive it this is an art many people know about it it can be learned you can do it because thought is a subtle vibration if you are receptive the other mind becomes a broadcasting station you become the receiver thought is a broadcast because ripples arise in the electricity around the man if you are silent enough receptive you will catch them when meher baba was in america somebody brought a man to meher baba the man had lived for many years in silence the man sat before meher baba closed his eyes and meditated and meditated and meditated again he would open his eyes and look at meher baba it took too long people became worried they said ‘you never took such a long time’ the man said ‘well what to do this man is not thinking at all there is no thought’ if freud or jung were near buddha or if they had come to me they would not have found anything to interpret they would not have found any thought to catch the east says ‘dreaming itself is pathology’ it is a sort of illness it is a disturbance when you are really silent thinking disappears in the day and dreaming disappears at night think ing and dreaming are two aspects of the same thing during the day while you are awake it is thinking and at night while you are asleep it is dreaming dreaming is a primitive way of thinking thinking in pictures just as children think that’s why in children’s books we have to make many colored pictures children cannot move with words very much by and by they will move you have to draw a big mango and write in small letters ‘mango’ first they vvill see the picture and then they will become associated with the word by and by the picture will become smaller and smaller and disappear then the word ‘mango’ will do a primitive mind thinks in pictures just like children do when you are asleep you are a primitive the whole civilization disappears culture disappears society disappears you are no longer part of the contemporary world you are a primitive in the cave because the unconscious mind has remained uncultivated you start thinking in pictures dreaming and thinking are both the same when dreaming stops thinking stops when thinking stops dreaming stops the whole effort in the east has been how to drop the whole thing we are not worried about how to adjust it or how to interpret it but how to drop it and if it can be dropped then why bother about the interpretation why waste time sooner or later the west is going to realize this because now meditative techniques are penetrating into the west meditations are the way of dropping dreaming thinking the whole complex of the mind and once they are dropped you attain to a wellbeing not of the mind you attain to something which is not even conceivable in your state of mind right now you cannot even imagine it what it will be like when you don’t think when you don’t dream when you will just be psychoanalysis or other trends take such a long time five years three years just interpreting dreams the whole thing seems to be so boring and only few people can afford it even those who can afford it what do they gain out of it many people have come to me who have been through psychoanalysis no self realization has happened they had been in psycho analysis for many years not only have they been psychoanalyzed they have psychoanalyzed many others and nothing has happened they remain the same the ego is the same on the contrary they are a little firmer stronger and the existential anxiety continues yes i don’t place much value on freud and jung because my attitude is how to drop the mind it can be dropped and it takes less time to drop it it is easier to drop it in fact it can also be dropped without anybody’s help the east stumbled upon the fact near about five thousand years ago they must have interpreted because in the ancient eastern books there are interpretations of dreams i have not come across a single new discovery which has not already been discovered in the east somewhere in the past even freud and jung are nothing new it is a rediscovering of the old territory again in the east they must have discovered but at the same time they discovered that you can go on interpreting the mind and there is no end to it it goes on dreaming it goes on creating new dreams again and again in fact no psychoanalysis is ever complete even after five years it is not complete no psychoanalysis can ever be complete because the mind goes on weaving new dreams you go on interpreting it goes on weaving new dreams it has infinite capacity — it is very creative very imaginative it ends only with life or it ends with meditation if you take the jump and die on your own death is needed for the mind not analysis and if death is possible what is the point of analysis these are two absolutely different things and you have to be aware jung and freud are geniuses gone astray great intellects but wasting their time and the problem is that they have discovered so many things about the mind but they themselves cannot use it — and that should be the criterion if i discover a technique of meditation and i cannot meditate myself what meaning can my discovery carry but that too is different in the east and the west in the west they say ‘maybe the physician cannot heal himself but he can heal you’ in the east we have always been saying ‘physician heal thyself first that will become the criterion of whether you can do it to others or not’ in the west they don’t ask they don’t ask that in the west science goes on its own personal questions are not asked because science is thought to be an objective study no thing to do with the subjectivity it may be so in science but psychology cannot be absolutely objective it has to be subjective too because mind is subjective the first thing that should be asked of jung is ‘have you realized yourself’ but he was really very egoistic he was thinking that he had realized he was reluctant to come to india only once he came and he was reluctant to go and see a saint even a saint like ramana maharshi he was reluctant he would not go what was there for him to learn — he had everything already and he knew nothing just a few fragments of some dreams that he had interpreted — and he thought that he had interpreted life you go on interpreting dreams and you think dreams are the reality in the east our standpoint is just the opposite we have been looking into life and we have found that life itself is a dream you think that by interpreting dreams you have interpreted reality just on the contrary we have looked into life and found that it is nothing but a dream and why this reluctance the east was a fear to jung he was afraid of the east and there was something in it he was afraid of the east because the east would reveal the reality of his own understanding — that it was false had he been to ramana had he been to some other mystic in the east he would have immediately realized that whatsoever he had attained was nothing it was just on the steps of the temple he had not entered the shrine yet but in the west anything goes without their knowing what selfrealization is they call it self realization you can call it any thing it depends on you self realization is coming to noself coming to

give me a stronger signal why didnt you do this and that etc as well as numerous other incidents where he lost his temper and broke things or threw things at me i cant tell you what a relief it is to put a name on that feeling that something was wrong and i could not figure out what i am in therapy now and building up my defenses against future pleading and guilttripping attempts to get me back
