became employed as a milkman he decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk soon afterwards smith purchased the cottage cafe a little diner in shawnee oklahoma before long he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant troys pan full of chicken on the edge of town in  smith went in with a business partner to purchase a fiveacre parcel of land that had a log house and a walkup root beer stand already named the top hat the two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant after realizing that the stand was averaging  a week in the sale of root beer hamburgers and hot dogs smith decided to focus on the moreprofitable root beer stand he also bought out his business partner originally top hat customers would park their automobiles anywhere on the gravel parking lot and walk up to place their orders however on a trip to louisiana smith saw a drivein that used speakers for ordering he suspected that he could increase his sales by controlling the parking and having the customers order from speakers at their cars with carhops delivering the food to the cars smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a usedcar lot to establish a layout for controlled parking he also had some socalled jukebox boys come in and wire an intercom system in the parking lot sales immediately tripled

at night in  at a standard sonic drivein a customer drives into a covered drivein stall orders through an intercom speaker system and has the food delivered by a carhop most driveins also have patio seating and many have drivethru lanes historyedit following world war ii sonic founder troy n smith sr returned to his hometown of seminole oklahoma where he became employed as a milkman he decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk soon afterwards smith purchased the cottage cafe a little diner in shawnee oklahoma before long he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant troys pan full of chicken on the edge of town in  smith went in with a business partner to purchase a fiveacre parcel of land that had a log house and a walkup root beer stand already named the top hat the two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant after realizing that the stand was averaging  a week in the sale of root beer hamburgers and hot dogs smith decided to focus on the moreprofitable root beer stand he also bought out his business partner originally top hat customers would park their automobiles anywhere on the gravel parking lot and walk up to place their orders however on a trip to louisiana smith saw a drivein that used speakers for ordering he suspected that he could increase his sales by controlling the parking and having the customers order from speakers at their cars with carhops delivering the food to the cars smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a usedcar lot to establish a layout for controlled parking he also had some socalled jukebox boys come in and wire an intercom system in the parking lot sales immediately tripled charles woodrow pappe an entrepreneur
