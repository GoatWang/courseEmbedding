the “company” included herein have been prepared by the company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations nevertheless the company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the financial information presented not misleading in the opinion of management the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature to present fairly the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented cost of goods sold for interim periods for certain entities is determined based on estimated gross profit rates interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year   these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the condensed consolidated financial statements include accounts of certain subsidiaries whose fiscal closing dates differ from december  st by  days or less to facilitate timely reporting certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation with no impact on previously reported shareholders’ equity the company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued    basic and diluted income per share   basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and potential dilutive common shares outstanding diluted income per share takes into consideration the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options resulting in approximately  and  potential dilutive common shares for the three months ended march   and  respectively for the three months ended march   and  none of the outstanding stock options would have been antidilutive    inventories   inventory costs include materials labor and factory overhead inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value determined on a firstin firstout basis appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence valuation and other factors in determining net realizable value revisions of these factors could result in the need for adjustments inventories net of reserves at march   and december   consisted of the following       march       december     chassis             raw materials               work in process               finished goods                                longlived assets   the company periodically reviews the carrying amount of its longlived assets to determine if those assets may be recoverable based upon the future operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets management believes that its longlived assets are appropriately valued             goodwill   goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired entities over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized however the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or if an event or circumstance occurs that would indicate that the carrying amount had been impaired the company reviews goodwill for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a twostep process if we choose to perform a qualitative analysis of goodwill and determine that the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further testing is needed if we choose the twostep approach or if qualitative analysis determines the carrying value more likely than not exceeds fair value the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value the second step is not necessary if the carrying value is more than the fair value the second step of testing is performed to compare the fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value    longterm obligations   credit facility and other longterm obligations   credit facility   on april   we entered into a loan agreement with first tennessee bank national association for a  unsecured revolving credit facility on december   our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to  on june   the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to march   and our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to  on june   the credit facility was further increased to  to give the company greater flexibility to finance current capital expenditure projects on april   the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to may   the current credit facility contains customary representations and warranties events of default and financial affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind covenants under the current credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends if the company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend among various restrictions we have been in compliance with these covenants throughout  and during the first quarter of  and anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during the remainder of    in the absence of a default all borrowings under the current credit facility bear interest at the libor rate plus  per annum the company will pay a nonusage fee under the current loan agreement at a rate per annum equal to between  and  of the unused amount of the current credit facility which fee is paid quarterly   at march   and december   the company had  and  in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility respectively at april   the company had  in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility   interest rate risk   changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on indebtedness under the credit facility because outstanding amounts of indebtedness under the credit facility are subject to variable interest rates under the credit facility the nondefault rate of interest was equal to the libor market index rate plus  per annum for a rate of interest of  at march   at the borrowing level under the credit facility at march   a one percent change in the interest rate on our variablerate debt would not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for the threemonth period ended march     other longterm obligations   at march   the company had approximately  in noncancelable operating lease obligations    stockbased compensation   during the three months ended march   and  the company did not issue any stock options and no stock options were exercised for additional disclosures related to the company’s stockbased compensation refer to notes  and  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december               commitments and contingencies   commitments   the company has entered into arrangements with thirdparty lenders where it has agreed in the event of default by a customer to repurchase from the thirdparty lender company products repossessed from the customer these arrangements are typically subject to a maximum repurchase amount the maximum amount of collateral that the company could be required to purchase was approximately  at march   and  at december   however the company’s risk under

contracts    recent accounting pronouncements   recently issued standards   in may  the fasb issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive in addition during  the fasb issued additional guidance to clarify certain implementation guidance previously issued and to rescind certain sec guidance effective upon an entity’s adoption of the new standard the guidance will be effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december   the company plans to use the modified retrospective approach to implement the standard and is currently evaluating the effect that implementation will have on its consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows            the fasbs new leases standard accounting standard update “asu”  leases topic  was issued on february   and is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions the standard affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate airplanes and manufacturing equipment the standard will require organizations that lease assets referred to as “lessees” to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases an organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases these disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements under the new guidance a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than  months consistent with current gaap the recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease however unlike current gaap which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new standard will require both types of leases ie operating and capital to be recognized on the balance sheet the fasb lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases the capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing gaap the operating lease will be accounted for in a manner similar to operating leases under existing gaap except that lessees will recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all of those leases   the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods and interim periods within these annual periods beginning december   with early adoption permitted see note  for the company’s current lease commitments the company plans to use the modified retrospective approach to implement the standard and is currently evaluating the effect that implementation will have on its consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows   recently adopted standards   in november  the fasb amended the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted the company has elected to

balance sheets as of december   and a longterm deferred income tax asset on the consolidated balance sheets as of december     in july  the fasb issued amendments to the inventory topic of the accounting standards codification to require inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value other than the change in the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on measurement of inventory the amendments will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted the company adopted these amendments in the first quarter of  and it did not have a

inc is the world’s largest manufacturer of vehicle towing and recovery equipment ®  with domestic manufacturing subsidiaries in tennessee and pennsylvania and foreign manufacturing subsidiaries in france and the united kingdom we offer a broad range of equipment to meet our customers’ design capacity and cost requirements under our century ®  vulcan ®  challenger ®  holmes ®  champion ®  chevron™ eagle ®  titan ®  jige™ and boniface™ brand names in this item  – “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “miller industries” “the company” “we” “our” “ours” and “us” refer to miller industries inc and its subsidiaries or any of them   our management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor our overall operating and financial performance these indicators include measurements of revenue operating income gross margin earnings per share capital expenditures and cash flow   we derive revenues primarily from product sales made through our network of domestic and foreign independent distributors our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors including general economic conditions as well as demand for and price of our products our technological competitiveness our reputation for providing quality products and reliable service competition within our industry and the cost of raw materials including aluminum steel and petroleumrelated products   our industry is cyclical in nature in recent years the overall demand for our products and resulting revenues have been positively affected by favorable economic conditions such as lower fuel prices and positive consumer sentiment in our industry however historically the overall demand for our products and our resulting revenues have at times been negatively affected by   • wavering levels of consumer confidence   • volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets and the resulting decrease in the availability of financing including floor plan financing for our customers and towing operators   • significant periodic increases in fuel and insurance costs and their negative effect on the ability of our customers to purchase towing and related equipment and   • the overall effects of global economic conditions   we remain concerned about the effects of these factors on the towing and recovery industry and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line with business conditions   in addition we have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the prices that we pay for raw materials particularly aluminum steel petroleumrelated products and other raw materials which represent a substantial part of our total cost of operations in the past as we have determined necessary we have implemented price increases to offset higher costs we also developed alternatives to some of the components used in our production process that incorporate these raw materials and our suppliers have implemented these alternatives in the production of our component parts we continue to monitor raw material prices and availability in order to more favorably position the company in this dynamic market   at march   and december   the company had  and  in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility respectively at april   the company had  in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility the borrowings under the credit facility were primarily used to finance our current capital expenditure projects for our pennsylvania manufacturing operations and at our ooltewah tennessee and greeneville tennessee facilities   critical accounting policies   our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates certain accounting policies are deemed “critical” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment estimates and assumptions a discussion of critical accounting policies the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows   accounts receivable   we extend credit to customers in the normal course of business collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues while such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past            inventory   inventory costs include materials labor and factory overhead inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value determined on a firstin firstout basis appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence valuation and other factors in determining net realizable value revisions of these estimates could result in the need for adjustments   longlived assets   longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable when a determination has been made that the carrying amount of longlived asset may not be fully recovered the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset’s estimated fair value to its carrying value the determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management or if available independent appraisals or sales price negotiations the estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue operating costs interest rates property and equipment additions and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors we believe that these estimates are reasonable however changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations based on these estimates we believe that our longlived assets are appropriately valued   goodwill   goodwill is tested for impairment annually or if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying amount goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a twostep process if we choose to perform a qualitative analysis of goodwill and determine that fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further testing is needed if we choose the twostep approach the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value the second step is not necessary if the carrying value is more than the fair value the second step of testing is performed to compare the fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill such events might include but are not limited to the impact of the economic environment or a material change in a relationship with significant customers   warranty reserves   we estimate expense for product warranty claims at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claims we review trends of warranty claims and take actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims we believe the warranty reserve is adequate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual   income taxes   our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense   deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses   the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple foreign jurisdictions asc  states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process on the basis of the technical merits   we  record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc  and  adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available            revenues   under our accounting policies revenues are recorded when the risk of ownership for products has transferred to independent distributors or other customers which generally occurs on shipment from time to time revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement recognition of revenue on bill and hold arrangements occurs when risk of ownership has passed to the customer a fixed written commitment has been provided by the customer the goods are complete and ready for shipment the goods are segregated from inventory no performance obligation remains and a schedule for delivery has been established while we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties we frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers sales of companypurchased truck chassis are included in net sales margin percentages are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing companypurchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal   foreign currency translation   the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date historical rates for equity and the weighted average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders’ equity intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expense in our consolidated statements of income   results of operations–three months ended march   compared to three months ended march     net sales for the three months ended march   increased slightly to  from  for the comparable period in  these historically strong levels of revenue were primarily attributable to continued solid demand in our domestic and international markets based on positive consumer sentiment domestic net sales for the period decreased from  to  offset by an increase in foreign net sales for the period from  to    costs of operations for the three months ended march   decreased  to  from  for the comparable period in  overall costs of operations decreased as a percentage of sales from  to  primarily due to product mix and continued efforts to monitor costs while meeting customer demand   selling general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   increased to  from  for the three months ended march   the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs related to an increase in staffing levels as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march     total interest expense increased to  from  for the three months ended march   as compared to the prior year period increases in interest expense were primarily due to increases in interest on distributor floor planning and on chassis purchases and borrowings under the credit facility   other income expense net relates to foreign currency translation gains and losses for the three months ended march   other income expense the net gain of  compared to a net gain of  for the three months ended march     the provision for income taxes for the three months ended march   and  reflects a

cash used by operating activities of  for the comparable period in  the cash provided by operating activities for the  period was primarily attributable to consolidated net income cash used by operating activities reflects increases in accounts receivable inventories and prepaid expenses offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities certain components of accounts receivable and accounts payable have extended collection and payment terms   cash used in investing activities was  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the comparable period in  the cash used in investing activities for the  period was primarily for the purchase of property plant and equipment relating to the capital projects described below   cash provided by financing activities was  for the three months ended march   compared to cash provided by financing activities of  for the comparable period in  the cash provided by financing activities for the  period resulted from borrowings on the credit facility of  offset by the cash used to pay dividends for the  period of             during the three months ended march   we borrowed a total of  and repaid a total of  under our credit facility at april   our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility increased to  from  at march   all of the borrowings under the credit facility during  were primarily used to finance our current capital expenditure projects for our pennsylvania manufacturing operations and our ooltewah tennessee and greeneville tennessee facilities   as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  not including  of unused availability under our credit facility our primary cash requirements include working capital capital expenditures the funding of any declared cash dividends and principal payments on indebtedness at march   the company had commitments of approximately  for construction and acquisition of property and equipment we expect our primary sources of cash to be cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand at march   and additional borrowings under our credit facility as needed we expect these sources to be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during  and for the next several years however our ability to satisfy our cash needs will substantially depend upon a number of factors including our future operating performance taking into account the economic and other factors discussed above and elsewhere in this quarterly report as well as financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control   as of march   and december    and  respectively of the company’s cash and temporary investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and their holdings are generally based in the local currency amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us   the company is finalizing the consolidation and expansion of its pennsylvania manufacturing operations to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies the plan includes consolidating primary manufacturing operations at one location the current estimated costs of this project are approximately  including machinery and equipment buildings and improvements and land approximately  of these costs were incurred as of march   and are included in property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets the remainder of these costs are expected to be incurred during the second quarter of  the timing and costs of the project are subject to change we do not anticipate any employee severance costs or any material relocation expense associated with the consolidation since the two existing facilities are very close to each other at march   we continued to utilize the remaining location for production of certain equipment and raw material inventory storage in february  the company entered into a contingent agreement for the potential sale of the remaining plant location   the company also began several capital projects during  involving machinery and equipment and building improvements at its ooltewah tennessee and greeneville tennessee facilities that it currently estimates will

such project are approximately  which are expected to be incurred during  the timing and cost of the project are subject to change   credit facilities and other obligations   credit facility   on april   we entered into a loan agreement with first tennessee bank national association for a  unsecured revolving credit facility on december   our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to  on june   the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to march   and our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to  on june   the credit facility was further increased to  to give the company greater flexibility to finance current capital expenditure projects on april   the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to may   the current credit facility contains customary representations and warranties events of default and financial affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind covenants under the current credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends if the company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend among various restrictions we have been in compliance with these covenants throughout  and during the first quarter of  and anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during the remainder of    in the absence of a default all borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the libor rate plus  per annum the company will pay a nonusage fee under the current loan agreement at a rate per annum equal to between  and  of the unused amount of the credit facility which fee is paid quarterly   at march   and december   the company had  and  in outstanding

finance our current capital expenditure projects for our pennsylvania manufacturing operations and at our ooltewah tennessee and greeneville tennessee facilities            other longterm obligations

to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position   interest rate risk   changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on indebtedness under our credit facility because the outstanding amounts of indebtedness under our credit facility are subject to variable interest rates under our credit facility the nondefault rate of interest was equal to the libor market index rate plus  per annum for a rate of interest of  at march   at the borrowing level under the credit facility at march   a one percent change in the interest rate on our variablerate debt would not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for the threemonth period ended march     foreign currency exchange rate risk   we are subject to risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations in europe we manage our exposure to our foreign currency exchange rate risk through our regular operating and financing activities additionally from time to time we enter into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts   because we report in us dollars on a consolidated basis foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position at march   we recognized a  decrease in our foreign currency translation adjustment account compared with december   because of fluctuations of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies compared to a  increase for the prior year period   for the

company who has cornered the market on the towing business i would have assumed best practice would apply to everything they do my new  series  allumium roll back carrier and wheel lift have soooo many completely backwards to best practice flawsdefects i would never have expected that from the industries core manufacturer from work lights installed in non idealexposed to be damaged not using bolts that resist corrosion bad welds wheel lift boots unfinished sharp metal obviously cut and not touched to remove burrs formerly had a killar deck and looking back i see for as small as they are they were miles ahead in so many aspects of their build quality milan bozovich · i bought a  international rollback that i ordered new with a century steel bed in nov  by march  it was rusted very badly was told to wait till the new plant was p and running in penn and they would repaint the bed and replace all the galvinized wheel lift parts that were also totally rusted i thought they should have replaced the bed seeing it was suppose to be new which had touched up rust spots already which lynch had pictures of it when i called them out to look at it but instead they took it to penn and repainted the bed in dec  in feb  it was rusted allover worse than the first time so now im getting the run around for the second time everone has to talk to everyone and didnt get nothing done sent miller  pictures of the rust it looks so bad everyone that sees my truck thinks i bought a used truck so ihave a  rust bucket you can scratch the paint off with your finger nail and when i asked about the warranty on the bed i never got a straight answer also my truck is garaged it doesnt sit out in the weather totally disgusted i think its time to let my lawyer take it from here i will post some of the pictures so you can see their fine so called workmanship so be aware when buying a new truck bed from miller industries nate buckler · ive had good times with miller as well as some bad times needless to say they know my name for many reasons i could say a lot but im going to say this they work hard to make sure youre satisfied at the end of the day they build a nice product that is tested and tried before they sell it their support after the sale is excellent ive had parts overnighted for  year old trucks ive had a long relationship with them and plan to continue for many years howard wheeler · very poor service had  new  series century beds mounted on  new  peterbilts with stationary pylons bought through bz wrecker sales the pylons look like they had been setting in the weather for years rust welding was not complete had splatters of weld half of it had no paint on the pylons took the trucks back to bz he said he could not believe how they looked took one truck back to tennessee they said they didnt have time to fool with it so we drove the truck back to birmingham al to bz and we took the truck to two different body shops of bz reference that they said take it to they didnt have the ability to remove the pylons or the next body shop didnt want to do it either so butch at bz said do you know body shop that can remove paint and replace them take it there and we will pay for it so we had that done now bz miller industries dot want to pay the body shop custom collison pelham al so watch out for what you get joel escutia · place is awesome was given a tour of

country singers fraternity brothers and anxious hostesses wont have to go on a beer run this new years eve if alcohol supplies run low this year in several columbus neighborhoods at least restocking adult beverages no longer will require keys or a car  just a smartphone and a credit card locallyowned refill can drop booze and beer at your doorstep and this month bostonbased drizly an online and mobile alcohol ordering service launched here and in two other ohio markets  akron and suburban cleveland as well as middletown the service is ecommerce for alcohol said nick rellas ceo of drizly it is a pretty simple idea letting you shop for alcohol on your phone mobile and online ordering has become the norm for a host of everyday items from shoes to shaving cream consumers can order groceries at giant eagle and kroger via their phone and arrange for pick up and there are numerous restaurant orderingdelivery platforms like grubhub cafe courier and amazon restaurants even wendys opened an office across from ohio state university that focuses on improving its mobile ordering and other technologies so it was perhaps inevitable that alcohol sales have made the move to mobile ordering and delivery there is clearly a tremendous amount of digital ordering said david portalatin vice president and food industry analyst at the npd group the consumer is rapidly adopting it  to get what they want where they want it yet alcohol has befuddled such enterprises before drinkos which offered alcohol ordering and delivery opened here in  and didnt last a year refill also opened in  and plans to expand into cleveland and cincinnati next year drizly has a longer track record at five years old its wellestablished for a mobileordering software company and operates in more than  cities further the company has experience navigating alcohol laws that vary state to state and that often date from the end of prohibition the other thing going for it is that retailers seem to like the concept and will keep trying some version of mobile ordering because an increasing number of customers want it people ask all the time it is a very common question said gursev sidhu owner of arena wine and spirits drizlys initial partner in columbus we had been looking to do delivery for two or three years but we had no system to do it with we couldnt do it on the fly sidhu has two regular delivery drivers and a pair of substitutes who can fill in his drivers are trained to combat underage drinking something drizly takes very seriously drizly requires that an identification card be presented and scanned at the time of delivery it is very thorough he said when we do id checking you have to check anyone you can see from the door if its fishy we dont complete the delivery sidhu also takes orders from refill drizly plans to expand to more retailers as it expands its service in columbus drizly is offering delivery to downtown german village clintonville upper arlington the university district and grandview heights areas sidhu cant usually reach from his arena district store refill can reach most of the neighborhoods inside interstate  as well as pickerington the services reach areas where we do not sidhu said thats one reason services like refill and drizly and amazon restaurants are likely to see a lot of growth in the years to come a good mobile ordering platform gives stores a way to reach additional customers in a format those customers prefer portalatin said refill can be accessed through its website wwwalcoholtogocom and via its app its service includes delivery of beer wine and spirits drizly can be accessed through its website wwwdrizlycom and by downloading its app its offerings include beer and wine  no liquor just yet  and it is offering free delivery for firsttime orders to promote its launch but delivery runs around  in most markets refill charges  for delivery there is also a minimum order set by retailers for arena wine and spirits the minimum order is
