dac  blog  weeks of dac chenming hu kaufman award winner  this years kaufman award winner is chenming hu in contrast to previous years this was presented on the sunday evening of dac instead of at a separate event in san jose chenmings career was reviewed by klaus schuegraf group vice president of euv product development at cymer inc now part of asml and also one of the many students of dr huone thing that i had no idea about was that chenming had climbed everest at the age of  that seems pretty much up there see what i did with inventing the finfet however dr hus career goes back a long way before the finfet he was instrumental in solving hotelectron problems back in the um almost typed nm there im so used to it era and then getting through the v scaling barrierbut in addition to being the father of the finfet he is the father of the bsim model this was the first industry standard nonproprietary model and is now used by hundreds of companies basically almost everyone and has revolutionized many aspects of circuit simulation making it more competitive and higher performancelipbu ceo of cadence briefly spoke it turns out that lipbu and chenming are neighbors so they know each other well without the obvious semiconductor connection lipbu talked about a couple of boards that he is on with chenmingchenming then accepted the award from kathryn kranen chairman of edac and donatella sciuto president of ieee ceda he talked briefly about his career his first professor was andy grove so his relationship with intel certainly goes back a long way he has had countless students and today over  leaders in the industry went through various programs with himto wrap up dr hu looked forward rather than back summarizing the finfets possibilities he saidgreat for

degree from national taiwan university masters and phd degrees from uc berkeley he has served on the faculty of mit and uc berkeley as well as the chief technology officer for tsmc the world’s largest semiconductor foundry he founded celestry design technologies an eda company that was later acquired by cadence design systems he was elected to the us national academy of engineering in  the academia sinica in  and the chinese academy of sciences in  he received the ieee andrew s grove award the don pederson award and the junichi nishizawa medal for his contributions to mosfet device technology and circuit design among his many other awards is uc berkeley’s highest honor for teaching the berkeley distinguished teaching award dr hu served as a board chairman of the nonprofit east bay chinese school and currently serves on the board of the nonprofit friends of children with special needsin recommending professor chenming hu for the phil kaufman award the nominator noted a tremendous career of creativity and innovation that fueled the past four decades of the semiconductor industry including the recent adoption of finfets by major semiconductor manufacturers which will propel the industry to its next decade his students recall him as a great mentor and role model “the kaufman award celebrates chenmings contributions to the eda industry for the bsim compact models widely used to design all types of integrated circuits spanning logic memory analog and rf products  his technical contributions have profoundly affected directions in device technology as with the finfet all aspects of device reliability and nonvolatile memory technology  his graduates serve in senior leadership positions in industry and academia globally  chenming has served in key leadership positions at tsmc and sandisk  with this award the semiconductor industry collectively applauds chenmings monumental impact” added this year’s award presenter klaus schuegraf group vice president of euv product development at cymer inc aart j de geus chairman and coceo of synopsys inc and edac chairman of the phil kaufman award selection committee said “recognizing chenming hu the very year in which the entire eda ip and semiconductor industry is unleashing the next decade of ic design through the nm finfet generation is not a coincidence but illustrates how a great contributor can impact an entire industry”“professor hu’s work and life stands as an example of tremendous contributions to science technology and society that would make phil kaufman proud ieee ceda is a proud partner to edac in honoring such a luminary” said donatella sciuto president of cedaaccolades for chenming hu“professor chenming hu’s impact on the semiconductor business has been wide and deep” notes eli harari retired founder chairman and ceo of sandisk  “he has been actively engaged with key companies in the semiconductor industry including national semiconductor tsmc and san disk he is a distinguished device physics researcher and a highly acclaimed educator and role model at uc berkeley his considerable technical contributions in mos device reliability device modeling scaling and finfet transistors have had a sweeping impact on the semiconductor industry”       “professor hu has pioneered the research on the cmos device reliability physics modeling and circuit simulation prof hu and his bsim group developed the world’s first and leading industry standard mosfet compact models bsim and bsim since  bsim has been used by all foundries eda firms fabless design housesip companies and most of the integrated device manufacturing companies from  micron down to nm in addition to nm finfet all together ten technology nodes due to the open accurate and efficient bsim models foundries fabless companies and eda providers can efficiently develop and enhance device models for each new generation of process nodes” adds chifoon chan president and coceo synopsys inc professor chenming hu has made some major contributions to the integrated circuit industry including developing the bsim compact model and early research on finfet transistors” concurs mark bohr intel senior fellow  “im very pleased to see him receive this recognition” dado banatao tallwood venture capital said “chenming is one of the best in microelectronic devices with significant impact in transistor modeling devices and device physics” john y chen vp technology nvidia corporation remarks “professor chenming hu has contributed immensely to eda tools and finfet and truly deserves the recognition of the phil kaufman award”under the leadership of professor chenming hu his group at uc berkeley developed the bsim and bsim models for use in mosfet integrated circuit design made the models public domain and available to the entire world provided technical support for the models and continued the development of these models to accommodate many of the nonidealities of mosfet devices as design rules shrank” shares laurence larry nagel author of spice  “without the tireless efforts of chenmings group the adoption of advanced cmos technology nodes would have been slower and more arduous and the pace of mosfet ic development would have been markedly slower  i think it is fair to say that more spice simulations have employed the bsim and bsim models than all other semiconductor device models combined“spice models lie at the root of all electronic circuit design and as director of the group that provided the industry with bsim and bsim prof hu has contributed to the design of more integrated circuits than any other individual” concludes colin mcandrew director of modeling at freescaleabout the phil kaufman awardthe phil kaufman award honors individuals who have had demonstrable impact on the field
