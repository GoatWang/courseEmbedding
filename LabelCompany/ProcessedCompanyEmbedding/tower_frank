ercwttmn  architects frank lloyd wright location bartlesville oklahoma united states architect frank lloyd wright references wikipedia project year  photographs flickr user ercwttmn flickr user graela from the architect completed in  the price tower in bartlesville oklahoma is the first and only realized highrise design project by the famed architect frank lloyd wright designed as the headquarters for harold c price of the hc price company a local oil pipeline and chemical firm the price tower is a departure from the prescribed style of wright save this picture  flickr user graela aside from the obvious transition from horizontal to vertical orientation wright seems to disregard the openness and flow of space for the way in which the organization of the spaces within the building were generated so much so that during the design phase wright incorporated the lines and divisions from the company’s logo   save this picture  flickr user ercwttmn the lines and divisions served as a way in which to divide the volume and spaces on each floor plan into a more unique organizational system rather than a typical office towerthe idea for the price tower was conceptualized as a tree such that there was one supporting organizational system  the core  that fed into the rest of the floors  the concept was a way in which to think of the core or trunk as more than just a main structural support but as an element that informs the floors becoming fully integrated into the overall system while in effect destabilizing the cores dominance on each floorwright nicknamed the building the “the tree that escaped the crowded forest” that was not only a play on his concept but a reference to a highrise building that wright had designed for manhattan yet was never built  save this picture  flickr user graela once wright was given the commission for the price tower he revisited the lost project to begin extrapolating ideas into the project thus the tree that escaped the crowded forest found its place on the oklahoman prairiealthough there is a formal discrepancy between wright’s prior works and the price tower there are still a multitude of principles from wright’s designs that were integrated into the project  at the time wright had become the master of cantilevering volumes and planes and in keeping with his initial conception of the tree as an organizational system all of the floor plates in the price tower cantilever off of the central core as to free up the floor for different spatial configurations save this picture  flickr user ercwttmn even though the price tower was intended mainly for the headquarters of hc price company and other office spaces there was an idea by the price family to include residential units in the building to help sustain the building’s use and financial security  save this picture  flickr user ercwttmn wright’s solution to organizing the mixed use tower was influenced through the extraction of lines from the company’s logo to further subdivide the floor plates  which resulted in rotating the axes of floor plate  degrees that subdivided the floors and the building into four quadrants  three of the quadrants were intended for office use while the other consisted of two floor residential unitsdespite the difference between the price tower and earlier works of wright wright is able to have the tower reflect the same organic aesthetic relating nature with architecture  save this picture plan the cast concrete of the floor of the towers floors and core along with the copper panel cladding that has an acquired patina over time establishes a relationship with nature through the buildings earthy tones save this picture site plan after exchanging owner the price tower today is known as the price tower arts center that has become a museum for art architecture and design  in addition to the museum the tower maintains an inn that allows visitors to experience frank lloyd wright’s original design and details for his only high rise project save this picture  flickr user graela in  the price tower was designated as a national historic landmark and in  it was one of ten other buildings by wright that were submitted to the world heritage trust save this picture  flickr user ercwttmn  flickr user ercwttmn  flickr user graela  flickr user ercwttmn  flickr user graela  flickr user ercwttmn  flickr

ak  everything ak companies daily news by frankk with  commentstags ak innovation occam razor simple works occam power solutions as the name implies is a typical small company offering battery management systems they have been expanding into the defense market with two products – one fitting their mo a remote ballistic fuse detonator and the other product being nearly the complete opposite in fact lacking any power at all the rear sight tower for the ak occam’s razor states “among competing hypotheses the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected”  or even more detailed “…entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily which is interpreted as requiring that the simplest of competing theories be preferred to the more complex or that explanations of unknown phenomena be sought first in terms of known quantities” basically the simplest solution if often the best in this case occam defense solutions has perhaps a simplest solution for the ak platform the rear sight tower simply does away with the graduated rear sight and instead replaces it with a milled rear sight and a picatinny rail the milled sight is fully capable of being zeroed though without adjustment simply they are making the simple weapon simpler unfortunately no pricing has yet been published for the rear sight tower generally speaking the product is oriented towards manufacturer’s who will have the presses needed to install and remove rear sight towers frankk tfb’s fng completely irreverent of all things marketing but a passionate lover of new ideas and old ones well executed enjoys musing on all things firearms shooting gun and attempting to be both tacticool and tactical advertisement anonymoose you said front sight tower in the title where is my railed ak gas block dammit brett baker it’s the fng curse seamus bradley do what this guy did and build it yourself rob problem for some with the railed versions of this “style” of sight mount its not original at all is your optic will be higher than the stock sights there are others that make and have made for some time mounts designed for certain sights aimpoints clones trigys etc that will co witness with the original irons and have built in non adjustable irons as well in other words this ain’t original nor likely better than some of whats already out there and has been for awhile rob wow now i watch the video…hell no i mean if you are building from scratch…maybe but there still are other probably better options at least one but why would you go with this over a bolt on system and have to pull your rifle apart to do so not for me houston moore well they do say that multiple times in the video and article… not frank dammit machine gun preacher iksnilol so it’s better to not be cowitnessed if cowitnessing then the irons obstruct the dot and one big part of using the dot is that you get unobstructed vision on target rob well i did say it could be a problem for some as some like a co witness while others don’t think is is worth it my assumption was it was another replacement for the rear sight not an entire rear sight block…like the attero arms mounts which gives a co witness if you don’t like the co witness the mro mount is almost not there its so low but this seems like another version of the kop so again its a “all ready been done product” but i’m not saying thats bad its just not a new concept and yes when i saw the the title “front sight tower” and how it didn’t really match the pictures of rear sight…i didn’t bother to read much and just looked at the pictures i just don’t see the logic with tearing apart a working rifle to add this its only for a build in my eyes and lets be honest right now is not the hey day of ak builds seamus bradley unlike so many other designs this is not attached to the gas tube and will not move on you or get so hot it will cook lower quality red dots bearacuda didn’t strike industries do this already it’d be interesting to compare the two cymond “simply they are making the simple weapon simpler” first that sentence hurts second your title says “front sight tower” usmcvet the inclusion of yeager shilling it means they just lost a lot of customers seamus bradley it was one of his students who invented a simple product that solves a real problem with an ak… get over yourself douche shootingfromthehip i run the attero arms bravo mount in the aimpoint micro pattern replacing my rear sight setup keeps my primary arms and holosuns low so i can cowitness with their built in iron rear sight in my opinion it’s the best sight solution by far — much better than this than gas tube rails and bulky extensive side mounts tom of toms waiting for my alpha mount o arrive definitely a superior solution to the problem iksnilol meh been done before would have been better if they made the rail adjustable sliding so that you can slide a red dot to different zeroes like you would slide the notched rear sight brandonaksalot i like this idea you’d probably need a stiffer leaf spring for it though or you’d lose zero from all the bouncing around seamus bradley no spring it is pressed onto the barre over the trunion brandonaksalot there’s a leaf spring in the rear sight block under where this attaches tsh st yeager’s voice speech patterns and mannerisms irritate and nauseate me nd looks like an inferior rip off of sabre werks kop kalashnikov optics platform justin sabrewerks has already perfected this design and has been around for years you can even interchanged optic specific mounts with theirs and it sits super low giving you the optimal setup jairo fajardo i’m with justin sabrewerks already perfected this design  advertisement most readpotd colt said no to full auto fungrey ghost precision partners with aero
