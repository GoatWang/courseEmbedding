many companies reevaluating their value chains or more accurately value grids as they shift from linear to three dimensional thinking around business cross linkages and relationships  while some manufacturers seem resigned to just push for price concessions from suppliers and perhaps ignore the true landed cost of goods market leaders are forming stronger broader relationships with key suppliers with aligned values and capabilities  the industrys leading supply chains have evolved from a linear potentially adversarial procurement model and created avenues to create longterm sustainable value  these businesses work with their strategic suppliers to refine their relationships and implement business sustainability concepts into every transaction  creating a healthy supplier

result in price reductions and decreased demand for our file cabinet distribution services we will be at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining the facilities employees financing and other resources required to provide file cabinet distribution services by prospective customers our opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our financial resources and other assets we expect to be less able
