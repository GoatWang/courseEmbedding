rod canion facebook  email  more pinterest print twitter rod canion a decade after he got the boot from compaq rod canion is once again betting on the next new thing by kathryn jonesseptember comments press spacebar to see more share options almost twenty years ago rod canion was a frustrated engineer at the granddaddy of texas’ hightech companies texas instruments he was itching to break out of the bigcompany mold and start something new so were his ti colleagues jim harris and bill murto over coffee in a houston pie shop the budding entrepreneurs hatched a plan to fill a niche in the fastgrowing computer industry sketching their idea for a portable computer on a paper place mat the machine they envisioned wasn’t much like today’s thin light portable computers the size of a small suitcase it was dubbed a “luggable” canion and his friends knew they were onto something big they just didn’t know how big they quit their jobs plunked down  each and in  founded a company they called gateway technologies almost immediately they renamed it to better describe their compact product—compaq computer compaq showed the world that houston could hit a gusher in something besides oil with backing from one of the computer industry’s most revered venture capitalists ben rosen compaq broadened its product line zoomed past fierce competitors like ibm and apple computer and eventually became number one in pc’s but like other cinderella stories in high tech this one didn’t end with canion and company cranking out computers and raking in money happily ever after by  cheaper pc clones were flooding the market and siphoning off compaq’s sales after almost a decade of stunning growth the company reported its firstever loss rosen and canion had different views about how to make compaq more competitive and speed up production according to canion rosen wanted to move production overseas but canion disagreed the two could not reach a compromise that october rosen whom canion considered a close friend orchestrated a move that rocked the industry compaq’s board booted canion out the door he could have taken the millions he had made from compaq and retired but he quickly dusted himself off and went looking for other ventures harris had resigned shortly after canion was fired and the two teamed up again in  to cofound insource technology a firm that provides consulting services for information systems compaq’s other cofounder murto had left compaq in  to pursue a master’s degree in religious education and eventually produce religious films canion invested in other hightech companies too but it’s his latest investment that has rekindled the excitement he felt in those early heady days when compaq was riding high canion was at a meeting of the houston technology center in  when he heard a twentysomething entrepreneur named troy williams make a presentation about his idea to build an online library that would not only help students research papers but also automatically generate footnotes and bibliographies williams had plenty of enthusiasm but no money his interest piqued canion set up a meeting with williams and the two talked for hours “i look at a lot of companies and i can give you a hundred reasons why they might fail” canion says “this was an exception” canion called williams after their meeting and said he wanted to kick in some seed money to get the startup going “i hung up the phone and jumped up and down for ten minutes” williams says with a laugh canion also called jim harris and together they put in  now two years later williams’ idea is a real company questia media with  employees and spacious but utilitarian offices in a highrise near houston’s galleria canion questia’s chairman and williams its ceo initially seem an unlikely pair of collaborators the wiry canion a yearold houston native is polished and lowkey with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from the university of houston his speech is measured and his brown eyes flicker when he’s excited about a subject but you can’t imagine him jumping up and down in contrast the exuberant williams is  years old and built like a linebacker a graduate of rice university and harvard law school he hails from mystic connecticut canion brought a lot to questia’s table he lured bigname investors like his friend ken lay the chairman of houston energy giant enron and ta associates a boston hightech venturecapital firm lay sits on questia’s board as does therese crane america online’s vice president of education products last year questia raised  million from ta associates and  million from oppenheimerfunds even though many hightech companies had fallen out of favor with investors after the big market crash canion also knew where to find seasoned executives to build a strong management team not surprisingly many came from compaq others came from walt disney’s disney online and publishers like harpercollins williams who was nine years old when compaq was founded looks up to canion as a strong strategist and a “great mentor” “rod has been instrumental in giving the organization the legitimacy it needed especially early on” he says “i wouldn’t be here without him” williams is convinced that questia will revolutionize learning by giving students and others hour access to an online library that is currently stocked with more than  books and journals in the humanities and social sciences canion agrees “this is really earth shaking in this business” he says “to have a copy of a book in this database and simultaneously have millions of people looking at it at one time and it’s never checked out—it’s always available” canion and williams believe questia’s approach is unique users of its online service which costs  a month can highlight passages of text and make marginal notes much as they would in a real book as they scan the pages they can click to automatically cite the book in a bibliography or mark a passage to be included in footnotes not only that questia offers extensive crossindexing for example a student scanning one book on its site might come across another work cited on a page the student can click on the cited work and through a hyperlink go directly to it saving lots of time in tracking it down the company which launched the service in january won’t reveal how many paying subscribers it currently has but williams says he’s pleased with the response and expects to be turning a profit next year this fall questia will get its first real test on college campuses the company has been buying advertising on cable channels that are popular with students such as mtv vh and comedy central to get the word out about its service “fall is really our grand opening” canion says and guess who’ll be looking on with interest his old friend ben rosen who ended up stepping in as acting ceo at compaq in  after the board fired eckhard pfeiffer who had succeeded canion in a twist of irony on rosen’s watch compaq stumbled again this time because the much leaner dell computer was eating its lunch rosen has since passed compaq’s reins to a new ceo michael capellas and the company is still struggling to rev up profits canion says he wishes compaq and capellas well and he reveals that rosen has more than a passing interest in questia he’s a small investor in the company seems that after all these years the guy who gave him the boot still has some confidence in canion’s ability to take an entrepreneur’s wild idea and turn it into the next new thing get texas monthly daily related content nrg

reverse engineer the ibm personal computer it rose to become the largest supplier of pc systems during the s before being overtaken by hp in  struggling to keep up in the price wars against dell as well as with a risky acquisition of dec compaq was acquired for us billion by hp in  the compaq brand remained in use by hp for lowerend systems until  when it was discontinued the company was formed

harris and bill murto three senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer texas instruments the three of them had left due to lack of faith and loss of confidence in tis management and initially considered but ultimately decided against starting a chain of mexican restaurants each invested  to form the company which was founded with the temporary name gateway technology the name compaq was said to be derived from compatibility and quality but this explanation was an afterthought the name was chosen from many suggested by ogilvy and mather it being the name least rejected the first compaq pc was sketched out on a placemat by canion while dining with the founders in a houston pie shop their first venture capital came from benjamin m rosen and sevin rosen funds who helped the fledgling company secure  million to produce their initial computer overall the founders managed to raise  million from venture capitalists as this gave stability to the new company as well as providing assurances the dealers or middlemen unlike many startups compaq differentiated its offerings from the many other ibm clones by not focusing mainly on price but instead concentrating on new features such as portability and better graphics displays as well as performance—and all at prices comparable to those of ibm’s pcs in contrast to dell computer and gateway  compaq hired veteran engineers with an average of  years experience which lent credibility to compaqs reputation of reliability among customers due to its partnership with intel compaq was able to maintain a technological lead in the market place as it was the first one to come out with computers containing the next generation of each intel processor under canions direction compaq sold computers only through dealers to avoid potential competition that a direct sales channel would foster which helped foster loyalty among resellers by giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing compaqs offerings either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales dealers had a major incentive to advertise compaq during its first year of sales second year of operation the company sold  pcs for sales of  million the first startup to hit the  million mark that fast compaq went public in  on the nyse and raised  million in  it enjoyed record sales of  million from  pcs and became the youngestever firm to make the fortune  in  compaq hit the  billion revenue mark taking the least amount of time to reach that milestone by  compaq held the fifth place spot in the pc market with  billion in sales that year two key marketing executives in compaqs early years jim darezzo and sparky sparks had come from ibms pc group other key executives responsible for the companys meteoric growth in the late s and early s were ross a cooley another former ibm associate who served for many years as svp of gm north america michael swavely who was the companys chief marketing officer in the early years and eventually ran the north america organization later passing along that responsibility to cooley when swavely retired in the united states brendan a mac mcloughlin another long time ibm executive led the companys field sales organization after starting up the western us area of operations these executives along with other key contributors including kevin ellington douglas johns steven flannigan and gary stimac helped the company compete against the ibm corporation in all personal computer sales categories after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth the softspoken canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped compaq to attract the best talent instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper canion chose a west coaststyle campus surrounded by forests where every employee had similar offices and noone not even the ceo had a reserved parking spot at semiannual meetings turnout was high as any employee could ask questions to senior managers in  company cofounder bill murto resigned to study at a religious education program at the university of st thomas murto had helped to organize the companys marketing and authorizeddealer distribution strategy and held the post of senior vice president of sales since june  murto was succeeded by ross a cooley director of corporate sales cooley would report to michael s swavely vice president for marketing who has been given increased responsibility and the title of vice president for sales and marketing introduction of compaq portableedit compaq portable in november  compaq announced their first product the compaq portable a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer it was released in march  at  considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of todays laptop some called it a suitcase computer for its size and the look of its case it was the second ibm pc compatible being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc it was a commercial success selling  units in its first year and generating  million in sales revenue the compaq portable was the first in the range of the compaq portable series compaq was able to market a legal ibm clone because ibm mostly used off the shelf parts for their pc furthermore microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers the only part which had to be duplicated was the bios which compaq did legally by using clean room design at a cost of  million unlike other companies compaq did not bundle application software with its computers vice president of sales and service h l sparks said in early  weve considered it and every time we consider it we reject it i dont believe and our dealer network doesnt believe that bundling is the best way to merchandise those products you remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software it is perceived by a lot of people as a marketing gimmick you know when you advertise a  computer with  worth of free software it obviously cant be true the software should stand on its merits and be supported and so should the hardware why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware i think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run compaq instead emphasized pc compatibility of which future computing in may  ranked compaq as among the best examples by october  when the company announced the compaq plus with a  mb hard drive pc magazine wrote of the reputation for compatibility it built with its highly regarded floppy disk portable compaq computers remained the most compatible pc clones into  and maintained its reputation for compatibility for years even as clone bioses became available from phoenix technologies and other companies that also reverse engineered ibms design then sold their version to clone manufacturers compaq deskproedit on june   compaq released the compaq deskpro a bit desktop computer using an intel  microprocessor running at  mhz it was considerably faster than an ibm pc and was like the original compaq portable also capable of running ibm software it was compaqs first nonportable computer and began the deskpro line of computers compaq deskpro edit when compaq introduced the first pc based on intels new  microprocessor the compaq deskpro  in  it marked the first cpu change to the pc platform that was not initiated by ibm an ibmmade  machine eventually reached the market seven months later but by that time compaq was the  supplier of choice and ibm had lost its image of technical leadership for the first three months after announcement the deskpro  shipped with windows this was a version of windows  adapted for the  processor support for the virtual  mode was added by compaq engineers compaq systemproedit compaqs technical leadership and the rivalry with ibm was emphasized when the systempro server was launched in late  – this was a true server product with standard support for a second cpu and raid but also the first product to feature the eisa bus designed in reaction to ibms mca microchannel architecture which was incompatible with the original at bus although compaq had become successful by being  percent ibmcompatible it decided to continue with the original at bus—which it renamed isa—instead of licensing ibms mca prior to developing eisa compaq had invested significant resources into reverse engineering mca but its executives correctly calculated that the  billion already spent by corporations on ibmcompatible technology would make it difficult for even ibm to force manufacturers to adopt the new mca design instead of cloning mca compaq formed an alliance with hewlett packard and seven other major manufacturers known collectively as the gang of nine to develop eisa the sedit aerial map of the compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard usa campus in unincorporated harris county texas by  compaq was so influential that observers and its executives spoke of compaq compatible infoworld reported that in the isa market compaq is already ibms equal in being seen as a safe bet quoting a sellside analyst describing the company as now the safe choice in personal computers even rival tandy corporation acknowledged compaqs leadership stating that within the gang of nine when you have  people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president someone has to write the letter compaq is sitting down at the typewriter ouster of cofoundersedit michael s swavely president of compaqs north american division since may  took a sixmonth sabbatical in january  which would eventually become retirement effective on july   eckhard pfeiffer then president of compaq international was named to succeed him pfeiffer also received the title of chief operating officer with responsibility for the companys operations on a worldwide basis so that canion could devote more time to strategy swavelys abrupt departure in january led to rumors of turmoil in compaqs executive suite including friction between canion and swavely likely as swavelys rival pfeiffer had received the number two leadership position swavelys u s marketing organization was losing ground with only  growth for compaq versus  in the market likely due to short supplies of the lte s from component shortages rivals that undercut compaqs prices by as much as  and large customers who did not like compaqs dealeronly policy pfeiffer became president and ceo of compaq later that year as a result of a boardroom coup led by board chairman ben rosen that forced cofounder rod canion to resign as president and ceo pfeiffer had joined compaq from texas instruments and established operations from scratch in both europe and asia pfeiffer was given  usd to start up compaq europe he started up compaqs first overseas office in munich in  by  compaq europe was a  billion business and number two behind ibm in that region and foreign sales contributed  percent of compaqs revenues pfeiffer while transplanting compaqs u s strategy of dealeronly distribution to europe was more selective in signing up dealers than compaq had been in the u s such that european dealers were more qualified to handle its increasingly complex products during the s under canions direction compaq had focused on engineering research and quality control producing highend highperformance machines with high profit margins that allowed compaq to continue investing in engineering and nextgeneration technology this strategy was successful as compaq was considered a trusted brand while many other ibm clones were untrusted due to being plagued by poor reliability however by the end of the eighties many manufacturers had improved their quality and were able to produce inexpensive pcs with offtheshelf components incurring none of the rd costs which allowed them to undercut compaqs expensive computers faced with lowercost rivals such as dell computer ast research and gateway  compaq suffered a  million loss for that quarter their first loss as a company while the stock had dropped by over twothirds an analyst stated that compaq has made a lot of tactical errors in the last year and a half they were trendsetters now they are lagging canion initially believed that the s recession was responsible for compaqs declining sales but insisted that they would recover once the economy improved however pfeiffers observation of the european market noted that it was competition as rivals could match compaq at a fraction of the cost under pressure from compaqs board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their houston headquarters despite falling us sales while the number of nonus employees had stayed constant compaq made its firstever layoffs  employees which was  of its workforce while pfeiffer was promoted to evp and coo rosen and canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper asian pc imports as canion wanted compaq to build lower cost pcs with components developed inhouse in order to preserve compaqs reputation for engineering and quality while rosen believed that compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster while canion developed an month plan to create a line of lowpriced computers rosen sent his own compaq engineering team to comdex without canions knowledge and discovered that a lowpriced pc could be made in half the time and at lower cost than canions initiative it was also believedby whom that canions consensusstyle management slowed the companys ability to react in the market whereas pfeiffers autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition rosen initiated a hour board meeting and the directors also interviewed pfeiffer for several hours without informing canion at the conclusion the board was unanimous in picking pfeiffer over canion as canion was popular with company workers  employees staged an impromptu protest with signs stating we love you rod and taking out a newspaper ad saying rod you are the wind beneath our wings we love you canion declined an offer to remain on compaqs board and was bitter about his ouster as he didnt speak to rosen for years although their relationship became cordial again in  canion admitted that his ouster was justified saying i was burned out i needed to leave he rosen felt i didnt have a strong sense of urgency two weeks after canions ouster five other senior executives resigned including remaining company founder james harris as svp of engineering these departures were motivated by an enhanced severance or early retirement as well as an imminent demotion as their functions were to be shifted to vice presidents market ascensionedit under pfeiffers tenure as chief executive compaq entered the retail computer market with the compaq presario as one of the first manufacturers in the mids to market a sub pc in order to maintain the prices it wanted compaq became the first firsttier computer manufacturer to utilize cpus from amd and cyrix the two price wars resulting from compaqs actions ultimately drove numerous competitors from the market such as packard bell and ast research from third place in  compaq had overtaken apple computer and even surpassed ibm as the top pc manufacturer in  as both ibm and apple were struggling considerably during that time compaqs inventory and gross margins were better than that of its rivals which enabled it to wage the price wars compaq had decided to make a foray into printers in  and the first models were released to positive reviews in  however pfeiffer saw that the prospects of taking on market leader hewlett packard who had  market share was tough as that would force compaq to devote more funds and people to that project than originally budgeted compaq ending up selling the printer business to xerox and took a charge of  million on june   compaq reached an agreement with cisco systems inc in order to get into networking including digital modems routers and switches favored by small businesses and corporate departments which was now a  billion business and the fastestgrowing part of the computer hardware market compaq also built up a network engineering and marketing staff management shuffleedit in  despite record sales and profits at compaq pfeiffer initiated a major management shakeup in the senior ranks john t rose who previously ran compaqs desktop pc division took over the corporate server business from svp gary stimac who had resigned rose had joined compaq in  from digital equipment corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering while stimac had been with compaq since  and was one of the longestserving executives senior vicepresident for north america ross cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of  cfo daryl j white who joined the company in january  resigned in may  after  years as cfo michael winkler who joined compaq in  to run its portable computer division was promoted to general manager of the new pc products group earl mason hired from inland steel effective on may  immediately made an impact as the new cfo under masons guidance compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits which increased compaqs cash from  million to nearly  billion in one year also compaqs return on invested capital aftertax operating profit divided by operating assets has doubled to  percent from  percent in that period compaq had been producing the pc chassis at its plant in shenzhen china to cut costs in  instead of expanding its own plant compaq asked a taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals with the taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached compaq in houston pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy to build pcs madetoorder which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software vicepresident for corporate development kenneth e kurtzman assembled five teams to examine compaqs businesses and assess each units strategy and that of key rivals kurtzmans teams recommended to pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years—or else compaq should exit that line also the company should no longer use profits from highmargin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones as instead each unit must show a return on investment pfeiffers vision was to make compaq a fullfledged computer company moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail pcs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that ibm did well at such as computer servers which would also require more customer handholding from either the dealers or compaq staff themselves unlike ibm and hp compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers inhouse as these could be costly assets instead compaq would leverage its partnerships including these with andersen consulting and software maker sap to install and maintain corporate systems this allowed compaq to compete in the bigiron market without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses in january  compaq was at its height ceo pfeiffer boldly predicted that the microsoftintel wintel duopoly would be replaced by wintelpaq acquisitionsedit pfeiffer also made several major and some minor acquisitions in  compaq bought tandem computers known for their nonstop server line this acquisition instantly gave compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included networth  based in irving texas and thomasconrad  based in austin texas in  microcom was also acquired based in norwood ma which brought a line of modems remote access servers ras and the popular carbon copy software in  compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a thenindustry record of  billion usd the merger made compaq at the time the worlds second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm digital equipment which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue had been a leading computer company during the s and early s however digital had struggled during the s with high operating costs for nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even and had recently refocused itself as a network solutions company in  compaq had considered a bid for digital but only became seriously interested in  after digitals major divestments and refocusing on the internet at the time of the acquisition services accounted for  percent of digitals revenues about  billion and their gross margins on services averaged  percent considerably higher than compaqs  margins on pc sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from compaq for years compaq had originally wanted to purchase only digitals services business but that was turned down when the announcement was made it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave compaq a  person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases by  services made up over  of compaqs revenues largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger in order to compete with ibm however it was also risky merger as the combined company would have to lay off  employees from compaq and  from digital which would potentially hurt morale furthermore compaq fell behind schedule in integrating digitals operations which also distracted the company from its strength in lowend pcs where it used to lead the market in rolling out nextgeneration systems which let rival dell grab market share reportedly compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate digital alone however pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market mark anderson president of strategic news service a research firm based in friday harbor wash was quoted as saying the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders – like being a  billion company by the year  or to beat ibm – but they didnt have anything to do with customers the new ceo should look at everything eckhard acquired and ask did the customer benefit from that if the answer isnt yes they should get rid of it on one hand compaq had previously dominated the pc market with its price war but was now struggling against dell which sold directly to buyers avoiding the dealer channel and its markup and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum at the same time compaq through its acquisitions of the digital equipment corporation last year and tandem computer in  had tried to become a major systems company like ibm and hewlettpackard while ibm and hp were able generate repeat business from corporate customers to drive sales of their different divisions compaq had not yet managed to make its newly acquired sales and services organizations work as seamlessly ouster of pfeifferedit in early  compaq had the problem of bloated pc inventories by summer  compaq was suffering from productquality problems robert w stearns svp of business development said in pfeiffers quest for bigness he lost an understanding of the customer and built what i call empty market sharelarge but not profitable while jim moore a technology strategy consultant with geopartners research in cambridge mass says pfeiffer raced to scale without having economies of scale the colossus that pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fastchanging computer industry that year compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many pcs causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices and since compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits pfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor rebuffing rosens suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of compaq president the board complained that pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rankandfile as he surrounded himself with a clique of chief financial officer earl mason senior vicepresident john t rose and senior vicepresident of human resources hans gutsch current and former compaq employees complained that gutsch was part of a group of senior executives dubbed the a team who controlled access to pfeiffer gutsch was said to be a master of corporate politics pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview gutsch who oversaw security had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca where the companys senior vice presidents worked there were accusations that gutsch and others sought to divide top management although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of tandem and digital equipment corp pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks saying we cut the team down to the minimum number of people  those who would have to be directly involved and not one person more robert w stearns compaqs senior vice president for business development with responsibility for mergers and acquisitions had opposed the acquisition of digital as the cultural differences between both companies were too great and complained that he was placed on the b team as a result compaq entered  with strong expectations fourthquarter  earnings reported in january  beat expectations by six cents a share with record  percent growth the company launched compaqcom as the key for its new direct sales strategy and planned an ipo for altavista toward the end of  in order to capitalize on the dotcom bubble however by february  analysts were sceptical of compaqs plan to sell both direct and to resellers compaq was hit with two classaction lawsuits as a result of cfo earl mason svp john rose and other executives selling  million usd of stock before a conference call with analysts where they noted that demand for pcs was slowing down on april   just nine days after compaq reported firstquarter profit being at half of what analysts had expected the latest in a string of earnings disappointments pfeiffer was forced to resign as ceo in a coup led by board chairman ben rosen reportedly at the special board meeting held on april  the directors were unanimous in dismissing pfeiffer the companys stock had fallen  percent since its alltime high in january  compaq shares which traded as high as  early in  dropped  percent on april  the first day of trading after the firstquarter announcement and closed the following friday at  during three out of the last six quarters of pfeiffers tenure the companys revenues or earnings had missed expectations while rival dell computer had  growth in us pc sales in the first quarter of  compaq could only manage  rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the internet had overtaken compaqs management team saying as a company engaged in transforming its industry for the internet era we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at internet speed in a statement pfeiffer said compaq has come a long way since i joined the company in  and under bens guidance i know this company will realize its potential rosens priority was to have compaq catchup as an ecommerce competitor and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company roger kay an analyst at international data corporation observed that compaqs behavior at times seemed like a personal vendetta noting that eckhard has been so obsessed with staying ahead of dell that they focused too hard on market share and stopped paying attention to profitability and liquidity they got whacked in a price war that they started subsequent earnings releases from compaqs rivals dell gateway ibm and hewlettpackard suggested that the problems were not affecting the whole pc industry as pfeiffer had suggested dell and gateway sold direct which helped them to avoid compaqs inventory problems and compete on price without dealer markups plus gateway sold web access and a broad range of software tailored to small businesses hewlettpackards pc business had similar challenges like compaq but this was offset by hps extremely lucrative printer business while ibm sold pcs at a loss but used them to lock in multiyear services contracts with customers after pfeiffers resignation the board established an office of the ceo with a triumvirate of directors rosen as interim ceo and vice chairmen frank p doyle and robert ted enloe iii they began cleaning house as shortly afterward many of pfeiffers top executives resigned or were pushed out including john j rando earl l mason and john t rose rando senior vice president and general manager of compaq services was a key player during the merger discussions and the most senior executive from digital to remain with compaq after the acquisition closed and had been touted by some as the heirapparent to pfeiffer randos division had performed strongly as it had sales of  billion for the first quarter compared to  million in  which met expectations and was anticipated to post accelerated and profitable growth going forward at the time of randos departure compaq services ranked third behind those of ibm and eds while slightly ahead of hewlettpackards and andersen consulting however customers switched from digital and tandem technologybased workstations to those of hp ibm and sun microsystems mason senior vice president and chief financial officer had previously been offered the job of chief executive of alliant foodservice inc a foodservice distributor based in chicago and he informed compaqs board that he accepted the offer rose senior vice president and general manager of compaqs enterprise computing group resigned effective as of june  and was succeeded by tandem veteran enrico pesatori rose was reportedly upset that he was not considered for the ceo vacancy which became apparent once michael capellas was named coo while enterprise computing responsible for engineering and marketing of network servers workstations and datastorage products reportedly accounted for one third of compaqs revenues and likely the largest part of its profits it was responsible for the earnings shortfall in q of  in addition rose was part of the old guard close to former ceo pfeiffer and he and other compaq executives had been criticized at the companys annual meeting for selling stock before reporting the sales slowdown capellas was appointed coo after pressure mounted on rosen to find a permanent ceo however it was reported that potential candidates did not want to work under rosen as chairman pfeiffers permanent replacement was michael capellas who had been serving as compaqs svp and cio for under a year a couple months after pfeiffers ouster capellas was elevated to interim chief operating officer on june  and was soon appointed president and ceo capellas also assumed the title of chairman on september   when rosen stepped down from the board of directors at his retirement rosen proclaimed these are great achievements—to create  jobs  billion in sales and  billion in market value all starting with a sketch and a dream late s–sedit strugglesedit capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the pfeiffer era and he repaired the relationship with microsoft which had deteriorated under his predecessors tenure however compaq still struggled against lowercost competitors with direct sales channels such as dell who took over the top spot of pc manufacturer from compaq in  compaq relied significantly on reseller channels so their criticism caused compaq to retreat from its proposed direct sales plan although capellas maintained that he would use the middlemen to provide valueadded services despite falling to no  among pc manufacturers capellas proclaimed we are no  in the traditional pc market but were focused on industry leadership in the next generation of internet access devices and wireless mobility thats where the growth and the profitability will be the companys longerterm strategy involves extending its services to servers and storage products as well as handheld computers such as the ipaq pocketpc which accounted for  percent of total unit volume during november  compaq began to work with microsoft to create the first in a line of smallscale webbased computer systems called msn companions in  compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with navisite under the pact compaq agreed to promote and sell navisite web hosting services in return navisite took compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and intelbased servers compaq struggled as a result of the collapse of the dotcom bubble bust which hurt sales of their highend systems in  and  and they managed only a small profit in a few quarters during these years they also accumulated  billion in shortterm debt around this time the stock price of compaq which was around  when capellas became ceo was trading at half that by  acquisition by hewlettpackardedit in  compaq signed a merger agreement with hewlettpackard for  billion including  billion for goodwill where each compaq share would be exchanged for  of a hewlettpackard share there would be a termination fee of  million usd that either company would have to pay the other to break the merger compaq shareholders would own  of the combined company while hps would have  hewlettpackard had reported yearly revenues of  billion while compaqs was  billion and the combined company would have been close to ibms  billion revenues it was projected to have  billion in annual cost savings by mid the expected layoffs at compaq and hp  and  jobs respectively would leave the combined company with a workforce of  both companies had to seek approval from their shareholders through separate special meetings while compaq shareholders unanimously approved the deal there was a public proxy battle within hp as the deal was strongly opposed by numerous large hp shareholders including the sons of the company founders walter hewlett and david w packard as well as the california public employees’ retirement system calpers and the ontario teachers pension plan walter hewlett only reluctantly approved the merger in his duty as a member of the board of directors since the merger agreement called for unanimous board approval in order to ensure the best possible shareholder reception while supporters of the merger argued that there would be economies of scale and that the sales of pcs would drive sales of printers and cameras walter hewlett was convinced that pcs were a lowmargin but risky business that would not contribute and would likely dilute the old hps traditionally profitable imaging and printing division david w packard in his opposition to the deal cited massive layoffs as an example of this departure from hp’s core valuesarguing that although the founders never guaranteed job security bill and dave never developed a premeditated business strategy that treated hp employees as expendable packard further stated that fiorina’s highhanded management and her efforts to reinvent the company ran counter to the company’s core values as established by the founders the founders families who controlled a significant amount of hp shares were further irked because fiorina had made no attempt to reach out to them and consult about the merger instead they received the same standard roadshow presentation as other investors analysts on wall street were generally critical of the merger as both companies had been struggling before the announcement and the stock prices of both companies dropped in the months after the merger agreement was made public particularly rival dell made gains from defecting hp and compaq customers who were wary of the merger carly fiorina initially seen as hps savior when she was hired as ceo back in  had seen the companys stock price drop to less than half since she assumed the position and her job was said to be on shaky ground before the merger announcement hps offer was regarded by analysts to be overvaluing compaq due to compaqs shaky financial performance in the past recent years there were rumors that it could run out of money in  months and be forced to cease business operations had it stayed independent as well as compaqs own more conservative valuation of its assets detractors of the deal noted that buying compaq was a distraction that would not directly help hp take on ibms breadth or dell computers direct sales model plus there were significant cultural differences between hp and compaq which made decisions by consensus and rapid autocratic styles respectively one of compaqs few bright spots was its services business which was outperforming hps own services division the merger was approved by hp shareholders only after the narrowest of marginsclarification needed and allegations of vote buying primarily involving an alleged lastsecond backroom deal with deutsche bank haunted the new company it was subsequently disclosed that hp had retained deutsche banks investment banking division in january  to assist in the merger hp had agreed to pay deutsche bank  million guaranteed and another  million contingent upon approval of the merger on august   the us sec charged deutsche bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of  deutsche bank consented without admitting or denying the findings compaqs premerger ticker symbol was cpq this was combined with hewlettpackards ticker symbol hwp to create the current ticker symbol hpq postmergeredit former compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard united states campus capellas compaqs last chairman and ceo became president of the postmerger hewlettpackard under chairman and ceo carly fiorina to ease the integration of the two companies however capellas was reported not to be happy with his role being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become ceo as the board supported fiorina capellas stepped down on november   just six months on the job to become ceo of mci worldcom where he would lead its acquisition by verizon capellas former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the ceo fiorina helmed hp for nearly three years after capellas left hp laid off thousands of former compaq dec hp and tandem employees its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up several senior executives from the compaq side including jeff clarke and peter blackmore would resign or be ousted from the postmerger hp though the combination of both companies pc manufacturing capacity initially made it the number one it soon lost the lead and further market share to dell which squeezed hp on low end pcs hp was also unable to compete effectively with ibm in the highend server market in addition the merging of the stagnant compaq computer assembly business with hps lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized for obstructing the profitability of the printingimaging segment overall it has been suggested that the purchase of compaq was not a good move for hp due to the narrow profit margins in the commoditized pc business especially in light of ibms  announcement to sell its pc division to lenovo the inquirer noted that the continued low return on investment and small margins of hps personal computer manufacturing business now named the personal systems group continues to be what it was in the individual companies not much more than a job creation scheme for its employees in february  the board of directors ousted fiorina former compaq ceo capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor but several months afterwards mark hurd was hired as president and ceo of hp hurd separated the pc division from the imaging and printing division and renamed it the personal systems group placing it under the leadership of evp todd r bradley hewlett packards pc business has since been reinvigorated by hurds restructuring and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers by late  hp had retaken the  sales position of pcs from dell which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality and held that rank until supplanted in the mids by lenovo most compaq products have been rebranded with the hp nameplate such as the companys market leading proliant server line now owned by hewlett packard enterprise which spun off from hp in  while the compaq brand was repurposed for some of hps consumeroriented and budget products notably compaq presario pcs hps business computers line was discontinued in favour of the compaq evo line which was rebranded hp compaq hps jornada pdas were replaced by compaq ipaq pdas which were renamed hp ipaq following the merger all compaq computers were shipped with hp software post merger logo for compaq products in may  hp announced in a press release a new logo for their compaq division to be placed on the new model compaq presarios in  hp reshuffled its business line notebooks the compaq name from its hp compaq series was originally used for all of hps business and budget notebooks however the hp elitebook line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the hp compaq b series became its middle business line as of early  the hp probook filled out hps low end business lineup in  hp sold part of compaqs former headquarters to the lone star college system on august   thenceo of hp leo apotheker announced plans for a partial or full spinoff of the personal systems group the pc unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for nearly a third of hp’s overall revenues in  hp was still selling more pcs than any other vendor shipping  million pcs in the second quarter of   of the market according to gartner while dell and lenovo were tied for second place each with more than a  share of the market and shipments of over  million units however the announcement of the pc spinoff concurrent with the discontinuation of webos and the purchase of autonomy corp for  billion was poorly received by the market and after apothekers ouster plans for a divestiture were cancelled in march  the printing and imaging division was merged into the pc unit in october  according to gartner lenovo took the lead as the number one pc manufacturer from hp while idc ranked lenovo just right behind hp in q  forbes reported that lenovo ranked ahead of hp as the world’s number one pc supplier the compaq brand name

from semiconductor manufacturer texas instruments the three of them had left due to lack of faith and loss of confidence in tis management and initially considered but ultimately decided against starting a chain of mexican restaurants each invested  to form the company which was founded with the temporary name gateway technology the name compaq was said to be derived from compatibility and quality but this explanation was an afterthought the name was chosen from many suggested by ogilvy and mather it being the name least rejected the first compaq pc was sketched out on a placemat by canion while dining with the founders in a houston pie shop their first venture capital came from benjamin m rosen and sevin rosen funds who helped the fledgling company secure  million to produce their initial computer overall the founders managed to raise  million from venture capitalists as this gave stability to the new company as well as providing assurances the dealers or middlemen unlike many startups compaq differentiated its offerings from the many other ibm clones by not focusing mainly on price but instead concentrating on new features such as portability and better graphics displays as well as performance—and all at prices comparable to those of ibm’s pcs in contrast to dell computer and gateway  compaq hired veteran engineers with an average of  years experience which lent credibility to compaqs reputation of reliability among customers due to its partnership with intel compaq was able to maintain a technological lead in the market place as it was the first one to come out with computers containing the next generation of each intel processor under canions direction compaq sold computers only through dealers to avoid potential competition that a direct sales channel would foster which helped foster loyalty among resellers by giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing compaqs offerings either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales dealers had a major incentive to advertise compaq during its first year of sales second year of operation the company sold  pcs for sales of  million the first startup to hit the  million mark

passing along that responsibility to cooley when swavely retired in the united states brendan a mac mcloughlin another long time ibm executive led the companys field sales organization after starting up the western us area of operations these executives along with other key contributors including kevin ellington douglas johns steven flannigan and gary stimac helped the company compete against the ibm corporation in all personal computer sales categories after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth the softspoken canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped compaq to attract the best talent instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper canion chose a west coaststyle campus surrounded by forests where every employee had

portable a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer it was released in march  at  considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of todays laptop some called it a suitcase computer for its size and the look of its case it was the second ibm pc compatible being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc it was a commercial success selling  units in its first year and generating  million in sales revenue the compaq portable was the first in the range of the compaq portable series compaq was able to market a legal ibm clone because ibm mostly used off the shelf parts for their pc furthermore microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers the only part which had to be duplicated was the bios which compaq did legally by using clean room design at a cost of  million unlike other companies compaq did not bundle application software with its computers vice president of sales and service h l sparks said in early  weve considered it and every time we consider it we reject it i dont believe and our dealer network doesnt believe that bundling is the best way to merchandise those products you remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software it is perceived by a lot of people as a marketing gimmick you know when you advertise a  computer with  worth of free software it obviously cant be true the software should stand on its merits and be supported and so should the hardware why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware i think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run compaq instead emphasized pc compatibility of which future computing in may  ranked compaq as among the best examples by october  when the company announced the compaq plus with a  mb hard drive pc magazine wrote of the reputation for compatibility it built with its highly regarded floppy disk portable compaq computers remained the most compatible pc clones into  and maintained its reputation for compatibility for years even as clone bioses became available from phoenix technologies and other companies that also reverse engineered ibms design then sold their version to clone manufacturers compaq deskproedit on june   compaq released the compaq deskpro a bit desktop computer using an intel  microprocessor running at  mhz it was considerably faster than an ibm pc and was like the original compaq portable also capable of running ibm software it was compaqs first nonportable computer and began the deskpro line of computers compaq deskpro edit when compaq introduced the first pc based on intels new  microprocessor the compaq deskpro  in  it marked the first cpu change to the pc platform that was not initiated by ibm an ibmmade  machine eventually reached the market seven months later but by that time compaq was the  supplier of choice and ibm had lost its image of technical leadership for the first three months after announcement the deskpro  shipped with windows this was a version of windows  adapted for the  processor support for the virtual  mode was added by compaq engineers compaq systemproedit compaqs technical leadership and the rivalry with ibm was emphasized when the systempro server was launched in late  – this was a true server product with standard support for a second cpu and raid but also the first product to feature the eisa bus designed in reaction to ibms mca microchannel architecture which was incompatible with the original at bus although compaq had become successful by being  percent ibmcompatible it decided to continue with the original at bus—which it renamed isa—instead of licensing ibms mca prior to developing eisa compaq had invested significant resources into reverse engineering mca but its executives correctly calculated that the  billion already spent by corporations on ibmcompatible technology would make it difficult for even ibm to force manufacturers to adopt the new mca design instead of cloning mca compaq formed an alliance with hewlett packard and seven other major manufacturers known collectively as the gang of nine to develop eisa the sedit aerial map of the compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard usa campus in unincorporated harris county texas by  compaq was so influential that observers and its executives spoke of compaq compatible infoworld reported that in the isa market compaq is already ibms equal in being seen as a safe bet quoting a sellside analyst describing the company as now the safe choice in personal computers even rival tandy corporation acknowledged compaqs leadership stating that within the gang of nine when you have  people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president someone has to write the letter compaq is sitting down at the typewriter ouster of cofoundersedit michael s swavely president of compaqs north american division since may  took a sixmonth sabbatical in january  which would eventually become retirement effective on july   eckhard pfeiffer then president of compaq international was named to succeed him pfeiffer also received the title of chief operating officer with responsibility for the companys operations on a worldwide basis so that canion could devote more time to strategy swavelys abrupt departure in january led to rumors of turmoil in compaqs executive suite including friction between canion and swavely likely as swavelys rival pfeiffer had received the number two leadership position swavelys u s marketing organization was losing ground with only  growth for compaq versus  in the market likely due to short supplies of the lte s from component shortages rivals that undercut compaqs prices by as much as  and large customers who did not like compaqs dealeronly policy pfeiffer became president and ceo of compaq later that year as a result of a boardroom coup led by board chairman ben rosen that forced cofounder rod canion to resign as president and ceo pfeiffer had joined compaq from texas instruments and established operations from scratch in both europe and asia pfeiffer was given  usd to start up compaq europe he started up compaqs first overseas office in munich in  by  compaq europe was a  billion business and number two behind ibm in that region and foreign sales contributed  percent of compaqs revenues pfeiffer while transplanting compaqs u s strategy of dealeronly distribution to europe was more selective in signing up dealers than compaq had been in the u s such that european dealers were more qualified to handle its increasingly complex products during the s under canions direction compaq had focused on engineering research and quality control producing highend highperformance machines with high profit margins that allowed compaq to continue investing in engineering and nextgeneration technology this strategy was successful as compaq was considered a trusted brand while many other ibm clones were untrusted due to being plagued by poor reliability however by the end of the eighties many manufacturers had improved their quality and were able to produce inexpensive pcs with offtheshelf components incurring none of the rd costs which allowed them to undercut compaqs expensive computers faced with lowercost rivals such as dell computer ast research and gateway  compaq suffered a  million loss for that quarter their first loss as a company while the stock had dropped by over twothirds an analyst stated that compaq has made a lot of tactical errors in the last year and a half they were trendsetters now they are lagging canion initially believed that the s recession was responsible for compaqs declining sales but insisted that they would recover once the economy improved however pfeiffers observation of the european market noted that it was competition as rivals could match compaq at a fraction of the cost under pressure from compaqs board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their houston headquarters despite falling us sales while the number of nonus employees had stayed constant compaq made its firstever layoffs  employees which was  of its workforce while pfeiffer was promoted to evp and coo rosen and canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper asian pc imports as canion wanted compaq to build lower cost pcs with components developed inhouse in order to preserve compaqs reputation for engineering and quality while rosen believed that compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster while canion developed an month plan to create a line of lowpriced computers rosen sent his own compaq engineering team to comdex without canions knowledge and discovered that a lowpriced pc could be made in half the time and at lower cost than canions initiative it was also believedby whom that canions consensusstyle management slowed the companys ability to react in the market whereas pfeiffers autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition rosen initiated a hour board meeting and the directors also interviewed pfeiffer for several hours without informing canion at the conclusion the board was unanimous in picking pfeiffer over canion as canion was popular with company workers  employees staged an impromptu protest with signs stating we love you rod and taking out a newspaper ad saying rod you are the wind beneath our wings we love you canion declined an offer to remain on compaqs board and was bitter about his ouster as he didnt speak to rosen for years although their relationship became cordial again in  canion admitted that his ouster was justified saying i was burned out i needed to leave he rosen felt i didnt have a strong sense of urgency two weeks after canions ouster five other senior executives resigned including remaining company founder james harris as svp of engineering these departures were motivated by an enhanced severance or early retirement as well as an imminent demotion as their functions were to be shifted to vice presidents market ascensionedit under pfeiffers tenure as chief executive compaq entered the retail computer market with the compaq presario as one of the first manufacturers in the mids to market a sub pc in order to maintain the prices it wanted compaq became the first firsttier computer manufacturer to utilize cpus from amd and cyrix the two price wars resulting from compaqs actions ultimately drove numerous competitors from the market such as packard bell and ast research from third place in  compaq had overtaken apple computer and even surpassed ibm as the top pc manufacturer in  as both ibm and apple were struggling considerably during that time compaqs inventory and gross margins were better than that of its rivals which enabled it to wage the price wars compaq had decided to make a foray into printers in  and the first models were released to positive reviews in  however pfeiffer saw that the prospects of taking on market leader hewlett packard who had  market share was tough as that would force compaq to devote more funds and people to that project than originally budgeted compaq ending up selling the printer business to xerox and took a charge of  million on june   compaq reached an agreement with cisco systems inc in order to get into networking including digital modems routers and switches favored by small businesses and corporate departments which was now a  billion business and the fastestgrowing part of the computer hardware market compaq also built up a network engineering and marketing staff management shuffleedit in  despite record sales and profits at compaq pfeiffer initiated a major management shakeup in the senior ranks john t rose who previously ran compaqs desktop pc division took over the corporate server business from svp gary stimac who had resigned rose had joined compaq in  from digital equipment corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering while stimac had been with compaq since  and was one of the longestserving executives senior vicepresident for north america ross cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of  cfo daryl j white who joined the company in january  resigned in may  after  years as cfo michael winkler who joined compaq in  to run its portable computer division was promoted to general manager of the new pc products group earl mason hired from inland steel effective on may  immediately made an impact as the new cfo under masons guidance compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits which increased compaqs cash from  million to nearly  billion in one year also compaqs return on invested capital aftertax operating profit divided by operating assets has doubled to  percent from  percent in that period compaq had been producing the pc chassis at its plant in shenzhen china to cut costs in  instead of expanding its own plant compaq asked a taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals with the taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached compaq in houston pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy to build pcs madetoorder which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software vicepresident for corporate development kenneth e kurtzman assembled five teams to examine compaqs businesses and assess each units strategy and that of key rivals kurtzmans teams recommended to pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years—or else compaq should exit that line also the company should no longer use profits from highmargin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones as instead each unit must show a return on investment pfeiffers vision was to make compaq a fullfledged computer company moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail pcs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that ibm did well at such as computer servers which would also require more customer handholding from either the dealers or compaq staff themselves unlike ibm and hp compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers inhouse as these could be costly assets instead compaq would leverage its partnerships including these with andersen consulting and software maker sap to install and maintain corporate systems this allowed compaq to compete in the bigiron market without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses in january  compaq was at its height ceo pfeiffer boldly predicted that the microsoftintel wintel duopoly would be replaced by wintelpaq acquisitionsedit pfeiffer also made several major and some minor acquisitions in  compaq bought tandem computers known for their nonstop server line this acquisition instantly gave compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included networth  based in irving texas and thomasconrad  based in austin texas in  microcom was also acquired based in norwood ma which brought a line of modems remote access servers ras and the popular carbon copy software in  compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a thenindustry record of  billion usd the merger made compaq at the time the worlds second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm digital equipment which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue had been a leading computer company during the s and early s however digital had struggled during the s with high operating costs for nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even and had recently refocused itself as a network solutions company in  compaq had considered a bid for digital but only became seriously interested in  after digitals major divestments and refocusing on the internet at the time of the acquisition services accounted for  percent of digitals revenues about  billion and their gross margins on services averaged  percent considerably higher than compaqs  margins on pc sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from compaq for years compaq had originally wanted to purchase only digitals services business but that was turned down when the announcement was made it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave compaq a  person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases by  services made up over  of compaqs revenues largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger in order to compete with ibm however it was also risky merger as the combined company would have to lay off  employees from compaq and  from digital which would potentially hurt morale furthermore compaq fell behind schedule in integrating digitals operations which also distracted the company from its strength in lowend pcs where it used to lead the market in rolling out nextgeneration systems which let rival dell grab market share reportedly compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate digital alone however pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market mark anderson president of strategic news service a research firm based in friday harbor wash was quoted as saying the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders – like being a  billion company by the year  or to beat ibm – but they didnt have anything to do with customers the new ceo should look at everything eckhard acquired and ask did the customer benefit from that if the answer isnt yes they should get rid of it on one hand compaq had previously dominated the pc market with its price war but was now struggling against dell which sold directly to buyers avoiding the dealer channel and its markup and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum at the same time compaq through its acquisitions of the digital equipment corporation last year and tandem computer in  had tried to become a major systems company like ibm and hewlettpackard while ibm and hp were able generate repeat business from corporate customers to drive sales of their different divisions compaq had not yet managed to make its newly acquired sales and services organizations work as seamlessly ouster of pfeifferedit in early  compaq had the problem of bloated pc inventories by summer  compaq was suffering from productquality problems robert w stearns svp of business development said in pfeiffers quest for bigness he lost an understanding of the customer and built what i call empty market sharelarge but not profitable while jim moore a technology strategy consultant with geopartners research in cambridge mass says pfeiffer raced to scale without having economies of scale the colossus that pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fastchanging computer industry that year compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many pcs causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices and since compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits pfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor rebuffing rosens suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of compaq president the board complained that pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rankandfile as he surrounded himself with a clique of chief financial officer earl mason senior vicepresident john t rose and senior vicepresident of human resources hans gutsch current and former compaq employees complained that gutsch was part of a group of senior executives dubbed the a team who controlled access to pfeiffer gutsch was said to be a master of corporate politics pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview gutsch who oversaw security had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca where the companys senior vice presidents worked there were accusations that gutsch and others sought to divide top management although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of tandem and digital equipment corp pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks saying we cut the team down to the minimum number of people  those who would have to be directly involved and not one person more robert w stearns compaqs senior vice president for business development with responsibility for mergers and acquisitions had opposed the acquisition of digital as the cultural differences between both companies were too great and complained that he was placed on the b team as a result compaq entered  with strong expectations fourthquarter  earnings reported in january  beat expectations by six cents a share with record  percent growth the company launched compaqcom as the key for its new direct sales strategy and planned an ipo for altavista toward the end of  in order to capitalize on the dotcom bubble however by february  analysts were sceptical of compaqs plan to sell both direct and to resellers compaq was hit with two classaction lawsuits as a result of cfo earl mason svp john rose and other executives selling  million usd of stock before a conference call with analysts where they noted that demand for pcs was slowing down on april   just nine days after compaq reported firstquarter profit being at half of what analysts had expected the latest in a string of earnings disappointments pfeiffer was forced to resign as ceo in a coup led by board chairman ben rosen reportedly at the special board meeting held on april  the directors were unanimous in dismissing pfeiffer the companys stock had fallen  percent since its alltime high in january  compaq shares which traded as high as  early in  dropped  percent on april  the first day of trading after the firstquarter announcement and closed the following friday at  during three out of the last six quarters of pfeiffers tenure the companys revenues or earnings had missed expectations while rival dell computer had  growth in us pc sales in the first quarter of  compaq could only manage  rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the internet had overtaken compaqs management team saying as a company engaged in transforming its industry for the internet era we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at internet speed in a statement pfeiffer said compaq has come a long way since i joined the company in  and under bens guidance i know this company will realize its potential rosens priority was to have compaq catchup as an ecommerce competitor and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company roger kay an analyst at international data corporation observed that compaqs behavior at times seemed like a personal vendetta noting that eckhard has been so obsessed with staying ahead of dell that they focused too hard on market share and stopped paying attention to profitability and liquidity they got whacked in a price war that they started subsequent earnings releases from compaqs rivals dell gateway ibm and hewlettpackard suggested that the problems were not affecting the whole pc industry as pfeiffer had suggested dell and gateway sold direct which helped them to avoid compaqs inventory problems and compete on price without dealer markups plus gateway sold web access and a broad range of software tailored to small businesses hewlettpackards pc business had similar challenges like compaq but this was offset by hps extremely lucrative printer business while ibm sold pcs at a loss but used them to lock in multiyear services contracts with customers after pfeiffers resignation the board established an office of the ceo with a triumvirate of directors rosen as interim ceo and vice chairmen frank p doyle and robert ted enloe iii they began cleaning house as shortly afterward many of pfeiffers top executives resigned or were pushed out including john j rando earl l mason and john t rose rando senior vice president and general manager of compaq services was a key player during the merger discussions and the most senior executive from digital to remain with compaq after the acquisition closed and had been touted by some as the heirapparent to pfeiffer randos division had performed strongly as it had sales of  billion for the first quarter compared to  million in  which met expectations and was anticipated to post accelerated and profitable growth going forward at the time of randos departure compaq services ranked third behind those of ibm and eds while slightly ahead of hewlettpackards and andersen consulting however customers switched from digital and tandem technologybased workstations to those of hp ibm and sun microsystems mason senior vice president and chief financial officer had previously been offered the job of chief executive of alliant foodservice inc a foodservice distributor based in chicago and he informed compaqs board that he accepted the offer rose senior vice president and general manager of compaqs enterprise computing group resigned effective as of june  and was succeeded by tandem veteran enrico pesatori rose was reportedly upset that he was not considered for the ceo vacancy which became apparent once michael capellas was named coo while enterprise computing responsible for engineering and marketing of network servers workstations and datastorage products reportedly accounted for one third of compaqs revenues and likely the largest part of its profits it was responsible for the earnings shortfall in q of  in addition rose was part of the old guard close to former ceo pfeiffer and he and other compaq executives had been criticized at the companys annual meeting for selling stock before reporting the sales slowdown capellas was appointed coo after pressure mounted on rosen to find a permanent ceo however it was reported that potential candidates did not want to work under rosen as chairman pfeiffers permanent replacement was michael capellas who had been serving as compaqs svp and cio for under a year a couple months after pfeiffers ouster capellas was elevated to interim chief operating officer on june  and was soon appointed president and ceo capellas also assumed the title of chairman on september   when rosen stepped down from the board of directors at his retirement rosen proclaimed these are great achievements—to create  jobs  billion in sales and  billion in market value all starting with a sketch and a dream late s–sedit strugglesedit capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the pfeiffer era and he repaired the relationship with microsoft which had deteriorated under his predecessors tenure however compaq still struggled against lowercost competitors with direct sales channels such as dell who took over the top spot of pc manufacturer from compaq in  compaq relied significantly on reseller channels so their criticism caused compaq to retreat from its proposed direct sales plan although capellas maintained that he would use the middlemen to provide valueadded services despite falling to no  among pc manufacturers capellas proclaimed we are no  in the traditional pc market but were focused on industry leadership in the next generation of internet access devices and wireless mobility thats where the growth and the profitability will be the companys longerterm strategy involves extending its services to servers and storage products as well as handheld computers such as the ipaq pocketpc which accounted for  percent of total unit volume during november  compaq began to work with microsoft to create the first in a line of smallscale webbased computer systems called msn companions in  compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with navisite under the pact compaq agreed to promote and sell navisite web hosting services in return navisite took compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and intelbased servers compaq struggled as a result of the collapse of the dotcom bubble bust which hurt sales of their highend systems in  and  and they managed only a small profit in a few quarters during these years they also accumulated  billion in shortterm debt around this time the stock price of compaq which was around  when capellas became ceo was trading at half that by  acquisition by hewlettpackardedit in  compaq signed a merger agreement with hewlettpackard for  billion including  billion for goodwill where each compaq share would be exchanged for  of a hewlettpackard share there would be a termination fee of  million usd that either company would have to pay the other to break the merger compaq shareholders would own  of the combined company while hps would have  hewlettpackard had reported yearly revenues of  billion while compaqs was  billion and the combined company would have been close to ibms  billion revenues it was projected to have  billion in annual cost savings by mid the expected layoffs at compaq and hp  and  jobs respectively would leave the combined company with a workforce of  both companies had to seek approval from their shareholders through separate special meetings while compaq shareholders unanimously approved the deal there was a public proxy battle within hp as the deal was strongly opposed by numerous large hp shareholders including the sons of the company founders walter hewlett and david w packard as well as the california public employees’ retirement system calpers and the ontario teachers pension plan walter hewlett only reluctantly approved the merger in his duty as a member of the board of directors since the merger agreement called for unanimous board approval in order to ensure the best possible shareholder reception while supporters of the merger argued that there would be economies of scale and that the sales of pcs would drive sales of printers and cameras walter hewlett was convinced that pcs were a lowmargin but risky business that would not contribute and would likely dilute the old hps traditionally profitable imaging and printing division david w packard in his opposition to the deal cited massive layoffs as an example of this departure from hp’s core valuesarguing that although the founders never guaranteed job security bill and dave never developed a premeditated business strategy that treated hp employees as expendable packard further stated that fiorina’s highhanded management and her efforts to reinvent the company ran counter to the company’s core values as established by the founders the founders families who controlled a significant amount of hp shares were further irked because fiorina had made no attempt to reach out to them and consult about the merger instead they received the same standard roadshow presentation as other investors analysts on wall street were generally critical of the merger as both companies had been struggling before the announcement and the stock prices of both companies dropped in the months after the merger agreement was made public particularly rival dell made gains from defecting hp and compaq customers who were wary of the merger carly fiorina initially seen as hps savior when she was hired as ceo back in  had seen the companys stock price drop to less than half since she assumed the position and her job was said to be on shaky ground before the merger announcement hps offer was regarded by analysts to be overvaluing compaq due to compaqs shaky financial performance in the past recent years there were rumors that it could run out of money in  months and be forced to cease business operations had it stayed independent as well as compaqs own more conservative valuation of its assets detractors of the deal noted that buying compaq was a distraction that would not directly help hp take on ibms breadth or dell computers direct sales model plus there were significant cultural differences between hp and compaq which made decisions by consensus and rapid autocratic styles respectively one of compaqs few bright spots was its services business which was outperforming hps own services division the merger was approved by hp shareholders only after the narrowest of marginsclarification needed and allegations of vote buying primarily involving an alleged lastsecond backroom deal with deutsche bank haunted the new company it was subsequently disclosed that hp had retained deutsche banks investment banking division in january  to assist in the merger hp had agreed to pay deutsche bank  million guaranteed and another  million contingent upon approval of the merger on august   the us sec charged deutsche bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of  deutsche bank consented without admitting or denying the findings compaqs premerger ticker symbol was cpq this was combined with hewlettpackards ticker symbol hwp to create the current ticker symbol hpq postmergeredit former compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard united states campus capellas compaqs last chairman and ceo became president of the postmerger hewlettpackard under chairman and ceo carly fiorina to ease the integration of the two companies however capellas was reported not to be happy with his role being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become ceo as the board supported fiorina capellas stepped down on november   just six months on the job to become ceo of mci worldcom where he would lead its acquisition by verizon capellas former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the ceo fiorina helmed hp for nearly three years after capellas left hp laid off thousands of former compaq dec hp and tandem employees its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up several senior executives from the compaq side including jeff clarke and peter blackmore would resign or be ousted from the postmerger hp though the combination of both companies pc manufacturing capacity initially made it the number one it soon lost the lead and further market share to dell which squeezed hp on low end pcs hp was also unable to compete effectively with ibm in the highend server market in addition the merging of the stagnant compaq computer assembly business with hps lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized for obstructing the profitability of the printingimaging segment overall it has been suggested that the purchase of compaq was not a good move for hp due to the narrow profit margins in the commoditized pc business especially in light of ibms  announcement to sell its pc division to lenovo the inquirer noted that the continued low return on investment and small margins of hps personal computer manufacturing business now named the personal systems group continues to be what it was in the individual companies not much more than a job creation scheme for its employees in february  the board of directors ousted fiorina former compaq ceo capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor but several months afterwards mark hurd was hired as president and ceo of hp hurd separated the pc division from the imaging and printing division and renamed it the personal systems group placing it under the leadership of evp todd r bradley hewlett packards pc business has since been reinvigorated by hurds restructuring and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers by late  hp had retaken the  sales position of pcs from dell which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality and held that rank until supplanted in the mids by lenovo most compaq products have been rebranded with the hp nameplate such as the companys market leading proliant server line now owned by hewlett packard enterprise which spun off from hp in  while the compaq brand was repurposed for some of hps consumeroriented and budget products notably compaq presario pcs hps business computers line was discontinued in favour of the compaq evo line which was rebranded hp compaq hps jornada pdas were replaced by compaq ipaq pdas which were renamed hp

placed on the new model compaq presarios in  hp reshuffled its business line notebooks the compaq name from its hp compaq series was originally used for all of hps business and budget notebooks however the hp elitebook line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the hp compaq b series became its middle business line as of early  the hp probook filled out hps low end business lineup in  hp sold part of compaqs former headquarters to the lone star college system on august   thenceo of hp leo apotheker announced plans for a partial or full spinoff of the personal systems group the pc unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for nearly a third of hp’s overall revenues in  hp was still selling more pcs than any other vendor shipping  million pcs in the second quarter of   of the market according to gartner while dell and lenovo were tied for second place each with more than a  share of the market and shipments of over  million units however the announcement of the pc spinoff concurrent with the discontinuation of webos and the purchase of autonomy corp for  billion was poorly received by the market and after apothekers ouster plans for a divestiture were cancelled in march  the printing and imaging division was merged into the pc unit in october  according to gartner lenovo took the lead as the number one pc manufacturer from hp while idc ranked lenovo just right behind hp in q  forbes reported that lenovo ranked ahead of hp as the world’s number one pc supplier the compaq brand name was discontinued in the united states in  in

senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer texas instruments the three of them had left due to lack of faith and loss of confidence in tis management and initially considered but ultimately decided against starting a chain of mexican restaurants each invested  to form the company which was founded with the temporary name gateway technology the name compaq was said to be derived from compatibility and quality but this explanation was an afterthought the name was chosen from many suggested by ogilvy and mather it being the name least rejected the first compaq pc was sketched out on a placemat by canion while dining with the founders in a houston pie shop their first venture capital came from benjamin m rosen and sevin rosen funds who helped the fledgling company secure  million to produce their initial computer overall the founders managed to raise  million from venture capitalists as this gave stability to the new company as well as providing assurances the dealers or middlemen unlike many startups compaq differentiated its offerings from the many other ibm clones by not focusing mainly on price but instead concentrating on new features such as portability and better graphics displays as well as performance—and all at prices comparable to those of ibm’s pcs in contrast to dell computer and gateway  compaq hired veteran engineers with an average of  years experience which lent credibility to compaqs reputation of reliability among customers due to its partnership with intel compaq was able to maintain a technological lead in the market place as it was the first one to come out with computers containing the next generation of each intel processor under canions direction compaq sold computers only through dealers to avoid potential competition that a direct sales channel would foster which helped foster loyalty among resellers by giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing compaqs offerings either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales dealers had a major incentive to advertise compaq during its first year of sales second year of operation the company sold  pcs for sales of  million the first startup to hit the  million mark that fast compaq went public in  on the nyse and raised  million in  it enjoyed record sales of  million from  pcs and became the youngestever firm to make the fortune  in  compaq hit the  billion revenue mark taking the least amount of time to reach that milestone by  compaq held the fifth place spot in the pc market with  billion in sales that year two key marketing executives in compaqs early years jim darezzo and sparky sparks had come from ibms pc group other key executives responsible for the companys meteoric growth in the late s and early s were ross a cooley another former ibm associate who served for many years as svp of gm north america michael swavely who was the companys chief marketing officer in the early years and eventually ran the north america organization later passing along that responsibility to cooley when swavely retired in the united states brendan a mac mcloughlin another long time ibm executive led the companys field sales organization after starting up the western us area of operations these executives along with other key contributors including kevin ellington douglas johns steven flannigan and gary stimac helped the company compete against the ibm corporation in all personal computer sales categories after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth the softspoken canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped compaq to attract the best talent instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper canion chose a west coaststyle campus surrounded by forests where every employee had similar offices and noone not even the ceo had a reserved parking spot at semiannual meetings turnout was high as any employee could ask questions to senior managers in  company cofounder bill murto resigned to study at a religious education program at the university of st thomas murto had helped to organize the companys marketing and authorizeddealer distribution strategy and held the post of senior vice president of sales since june  murto was succeeded by ross a cooley director of corporate sales cooley would report to michael s swavely vice president for marketing who has been given increased responsibility and the title of vice president for sales and marketing introduction of compaq portableedit compaq portable in november  compaq announced their first product the compaq portable a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer it was released in march  at  considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of todays laptop some called it a suitcase computer for its size and the look of its case it was the second ibm pc compatible being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc it was a commercial success selling  units in its first year and generating  million in sales revenue the compaq portable was the first in the range of the compaq portable series compaq was able to market a legal ibm clone because ibm mostly used off the shelf parts for their pc furthermore microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers the only part which had to be duplicated was the bios which compaq did legally by using clean room design at a cost of  million unlike other companies compaq did not bundle application software with its computers vice president of sales and service h l sparks said in early  weve considered it and every time we consider it we reject it i dont believe and our dealer network doesnt believe that bundling is the best way to merchandise those products you remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software it is perceived by a lot of people as a marketing gimmick you know when you advertise a  computer with  worth of free software it obviously cant be true the software should stand on its merits and be supported and so should the hardware why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware i think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run compaq instead emphasized pc compatibility of which future computing in may  ranked compaq as among the best examples by october  when the company announced the compaq plus with a  mb hard drive pc magazine wrote of the reputation for compatibility it built with its highly regarded floppy disk portable compaq computers remained the most compatible pc clones into  and maintained its reputation for compatibility for years even as clone bioses became available from phoenix technologies and other companies that also reverse engineered ibms design then sold their version to clone manufacturers compaq deskproedit on june   compaq released the compaq deskpro a bit desktop computer using an intel  microprocessor running at  mhz it was considerably faster than an ibm pc and was like the original compaq portable also capable of running ibm software it was compaqs first nonportable computer and began the deskpro line of computers compaq deskpro edit when compaq introduced the first pc based on intels new  microprocessor the compaq deskpro  in  it marked the first cpu change to the pc platform that was not initiated by ibm an ibmmade  machine eventually reached the market seven months later but by that time compaq was the  supplier of choice and ibm had lost its image of technical leadership for the first three months after announcement the deskpro  shipped with windows this was a version of windows  adapted for the  processor support for the virtual  mode was added by compaq engineers compaq systemproedit compaqs technical leadership and the rivalry with ibm was emphasized when the systempro server was launched in late  – this was a true server product with standard support for a second cpu and raid but also the first product to feature the eisa bus designed in reaction to ibms mca microchannel architecture which was incompatible with the original at bus although compaq had become successful by being  percent ibmcompatible it decided to continue with the original at bus—which it renamed isa—instead of licensing ibms mca prior to developing eisa compaq had invested significant resources into reverse engineering mca but its executives correctly calculated that the  billion already spent by corporations on ibmcompatible technology would make it difficult for even ibm to force manufacturers to adopt the new mca design instead of cloning mca compaq formed an alliance with hewlett packard and seven other major manufacturers known collectively as the gang of nine to develop eisa the sedit aerial map of the compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard usa campus in unincorporated harris county texas by  compaq was so influential that observers and its executives spoke of compaq compatible infoworld reported that in the isa market compaq is already ibms equal in being seen as a safe bet quoting a sellside analyst describing the company as now the safe choice in personal computers even rival tandy corporation acknowledged compaqs leadership stating that within the gang of nine when you have  people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president someone has to write the letter compaq is sitting down at the typewriter ouster of cofoundersedit michael s swavely president of compaqs north american division since may  took a sixmonth sabbatical in january  which would eventually become retirement effective on july   eckhard pfeiffer then president of compaq international was named to succeed him pfeiffer also received the title of chief operating officer with responsibility for the companys operations on a worldwide basis so that canion could devote more time to strategy swavelys abrupt departure in january led to rumors of turmoil in compaqs executive suite including friction between canion and swavely likely as swavelys rival pfeiffer had received the number two leadership position swavelys u s marketing organization was losing ground with only  growth for compaq versus  in the market likely due to short supplies of the lte s from component shortages rivals that undercut compaqs prices by as much as  and large customers who did not like compaqs dealeronly policy pfeiffer became president and ceo of compaq later that year as a result of a boardroom coup led by board chairman ben rosen that forced cofounder rod canion to resign as president and ceo pfeiffer had joined compaq from texas instruments and established operations from scratch in both europe and asia pfeiffer was given  usd to start up compaq europe he started up compaqs first overseas office in munich in  by  compaq europe was a  billion business and number two behind ibm in that region and foreign sales contributed  percent of compaqs revenues pfeiffer while transplanting compaqs u s strategy of dealeronly distribution to europe was more selective in signing up dealers than compaq had been in the u s such that european dealers were more qualified to handle its increasingly complex products during the s under canions direction compaq had focused on engineering research and quality control producing highend highperformance machines with high profit margins that allowed compaq to continue investing in engineering and nextgeneration technology this strategy was successful as compaq was considered a trusted brand while many other ibm clones were untrusted due to being plagued by poor reliability however by the end of the eighties many manufacturers had improved their quality and were able to produce inexpensive pcs with offtheshelf components incurring none of the rd costs which allowed them to undercut compaqs expensive computers faced with lowercost rivals such as dell computer ast research and gateway  compaq suffered a  million loss for that quarter their first loss as a company while the stock had dropped by over twothirds an analyst stated that compaq has made a lot of tactical errors in the last year and a half they were trendsetters now they are lagging canion initially believed that the s recession was responsible for compaqs declining sales but insisted that they would recover once the economy improved however pfeiffers observation of the european market noted that it was competition as rivals could match compaq at a fraction of the cost under pressure from compaqs board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their houston headquarters despite falling us sales while the number of nonus employees had stayed constant compaq made its firstever layoffs  employees which was  of its workforce while pfeiffer was promoted to evp and coo rosen and canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper asian pc imports as canion wanted compaq to build lower cost pcs with components developed inhouse in order to preserve compaqs reputation for engineering and quality while rosen believed that compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster while canion developed an month plan to create a line of lowpriced computers rosen sent his own compaq engineering team to comdex without canions knowledge and discovered that a lowpriced pc could be made in half the time and at lower cost than canions initiative it was also believedby whom that canions consensusstyle management slowed the companys ability to react in the market whereas pfeiffers autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition rosen initiated a hour board meeting and the directors also interviewed pfeiffer for several hours without informing canion at the conclusion the board was unanimous in picking pfeiffer over canion as canion was popular with company workers  employees staged an impromptu protest with signs stating we love you rod and taking out a newspaper ad saying rod you are the wind beneath our wings we love you canion declined an offer to remain on compaqs board and was bitter about his ouster as he didnt speak to rosen for years although their relationship became cordial again in  canion admitted that his ouster was justified saying i was burned out i needed to leave he rosen felt i didnt have a strong sense of urgency two weeks after canions ouster five other senior executives resigned including remaining company founder james harris as svp of engineering these departures were motivated by an enhanced severance or early retirement as well as an imminent demotion as their functions were to be shifted to vice presidents market ascensionedit under pfeiffers tenure as chief executive compaq entered the retail computer market with the compaq presario as one of the first manufacturers in the mids to market a sub pc in order to maintain the prices it wanted compaq became the first firsttier computer manufacturer to utilize cpus from amd and cyrix the two price wars resulting from compaqs actions ultimately drove numerous competitors from the market such as packard bell and ast research from third place in  compaq had overtaken apple computer and even surpassed ibm as the top pc manufacturer in  as both ibm and apple were struggling considerably during that time compaqs inventory and gross margins were better than that of its rivals which enabled it to wage the price wars compaq had decided to make a foray into printers in  and the first models were released to positive reviews in  however pfeiffer saw that the prospects of taking on market leader hewlett packard who had  market share was tough as that would force compaq to devote more funds and people to that project than originally budgeted compaq ending up selling the printer business to xerox and took a charge of  million on june   compaq reached an agreement with cisco systems inc in order to get into networking including digital modems routers and switches favored by small businesses and corporate departments which was now a  billion business and the fastestgrowing part of the computer hardware market compaq also built up a network engineering and marketing staff management shuffleedit in  despite record sales and profits at compaq pfeiffer initiated a major management shakeup in the senior ranks john t rose who previously ran compaqs desktop pc division took over the corporate server business from svp gary stimac who had resigned rose had joined compaq in  from digital equipment corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering while stimac had been with compaq since  and was one of the longestserving executives senior vicepresident for north america ross cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of  cfo daryl j white who joined the company in january  resigned in may  after  years as cfo michael winkler who joined compaq in  to run its portable computer division was promoted to general manager of the new pc products group earl mason hired from inland steel effective on may  immediately made an impact as the new cfo under masons guidance compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits which increased compaqs cash from  million to nearly  billion in one year also compaqs return on invested capital aftertax operating profit divided by operating assets has doubled to  percent from  percent in that period compaq had been producing the pc chassis at its plant in shenzhen china to cut costs in  instead of expanding its own plant compaq asked a taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals with the taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached compaq in houston pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy to build pcs madetoorder which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software vicepresident for corporate development kenneth e kurtzman assembled five teams to examine compaqs businesses and assess each units strategy and that of key rivals kurtzmans teams recommended to pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years—or else compaq should exit that line also the company should no longer use profits from highmargin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones as instead each unit must show a return on investment pfeiffers vision was to make compaq a fullfledged computer company moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail pcs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that ibm did well at such as computer servers which would also require more customer handholding from either the dealers or compaq staff themselves unlike ibm and hp compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers inhouse as these could be costly assets instead compaq would leverage its partnerships including these with andersen consulting and software maker sap to install and maintain corporate systems this allowed compaq to compete in the bigiron market without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses in january  compaq was at its height ceo pfeiffer boldly predicted that the microsoftintel wintel duopoly would be replaced by wintelpaq acquisitionsedit pfeiffer also made several major and some minor acquisitions in  compaq bought tandem computers known for their nonstop server line this acquisition instantly gave compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included networth  based in irving texas and thomasconrad  based in austin texas in  microcom was also acquired based in norwood ma which brought a line of modems remote access servers ras and the popular carbon copy software in  compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a thenindustry record of  billion usd the merger made compaq at the time the worlds second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm digital equipment which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue had been a leading computer company during the s and early s however digital had struggled during the s with high operating costs for nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even and had recently refocused itself as a network solutions company in  compaq had considered a bid for digital but only became seriously interested in  after digitals major divestments and refocusing on the internet at the time of the acquisition services accounted for  percent of digitals revenues about  billion and their gross margins on services averaged  percent considerably higher than compaqs  margins on pc sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from compaq for years compaq had originally wanted to purchase only digitals services business but that was turned down when the announcement was made it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave compaq a  person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases by  services made up over  of compaqs revenues largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger in order to compete with ibm however it was also risky merger as the combined company would have to lay off  employees from compaq and  from digital which would potentially hurt morale furthermore compaq fell behind schedule in integrating digitals operations which also distracted the company from its strength in lowend pcs where it used to lead the market in rolling out nextgeneration systems which let rival dell grab market share reportedly compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate digital alone however pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market mark anderson president of strategic news service a research firm based in friday harbor wash was quoted as saying the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders – like being a  billion company by the year  or to beat ibm – but they didnt have anything to do with customers the new ceo should look at everything eckhard acquired and ask did the customer benefit from that if the answer isnt yes they should get rid of it on one hand compaq had previously dominated the pc market with its price war but was now struggling against dell which sold directly to buyers avoiding the dealer channel and its markup and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum at the same time compaq through its acquisitions of the digital equipment corporation last year and tandem computer in  had tried to become a major systems company like ibm and hewlettpackard while ibm and hp were able generate repeat business from corporate customers to drive sales of their different divisions compaq had not yet managed to make its newly acquired sales and services organizations work as seamlessly ouster of pfeifferedit in early  compaq had the problem of bloated pc inventories by summer  compaq was suffering from productquality problems robert w stearns svp of business development said in pfeiffers quest for bigness he lost an understanding of the customer and built what i call empty market sharelarge but not profitable while jim moore a technology strategy consultant with geopartners research in cambridge mass says pfeiffer raced to scale without having economies of scale the colossus that pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fastchanging computer industry that year compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many pcs causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices and since compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits pfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor rebuffing rosens suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of compaq president the board complained that pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rankandfile as he surrounded himself with a clique of chief financial officer earl mason senior vicepresident john t rose and senior vicepresident of human resources hans gutsch current and former compaq employees complained that gutsch was part of a group of senior executives dubbed the a team who controlled access to pfeiffer gutsch was said to be a master of corporate politics pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview gutsch who oversaw security had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca where the companys senior vice presidents worked there were accusations that gutsch and others sought to divide top management although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of tandem and digital equipment corp pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks saying we cut the team down to the minimum number of people  those who would have to be directly involved and not one person more robert w stearns compaqs senior vice president for business development with responsibility for mergers and acquisitions had opposed the acquisition of digital as the cultural differences between both companies were too great and complained that he was placed on the b team as a result compaq entered  with strong expectations fourthquarter  earnings reported in january  beat expectations by six cents a share with record  percent growth the company launched compaqcom as the key for its new direct sales strategy and planned an ipo for altavista toward the end of  in order to capitalize on the dotcom bubble however by february  analysts were sceptical of compaqs plan to sell both direct and to resellers compaq was hit with two classaction lawsuits as a result of cfo earl mason svp john rose and other executives selling  million usd of stock before a conference call with analysts where they noted that demand for pcs was slowing down on april   just nine days after compaq reported firstquarter profit being at half of what analysts had expected the latest in a string of earnings disappointments pfeiffer was forced to resign as ceo in a coup led by board chairman ben rosen reportedly at the special board meeting held on april  the directors were unanimous in dismissing pfeiffer the companys stock had fallen  percent since its alltime high in january  compaq shares which traded as high as  early in  dropped  percent on april  the first day of trading after the firstquarter announcement and closed the following friday at  during three out of the last six quarters of pfeiffers tenure the companys revenues or earnings had missed expectations while rival dell computer had  growth in us pc sales in the first quarter of  compaq could only manage  rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the internet had overtaken compaqs management team saying as a company engaged in transforming its industry for the internet era we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at internet speed in a statement pfeiffer said compaq has come a long way since i joined the company in  and under bens guidance i know this company will realize its potential rosens priority was to have compaq catchup as an ecommerce competitor and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company roger kay an analyst at international data corporation observed that compaqs behavior at times seemed like a personal vendetta noting that eckhard has been so obsessed with staying ahead of dell that they focused too hard on market share and stopped paying attention to profitability and liquidity they got whacked in a price war that they started subsequent earnings releases from compaqs rivals dell gateway ibm and hewlettpackard suggested that the problems were not affecting the whole pc industry as pfeiffer had suggested dell and gateway sold direct which helped them to avoid compaqs inventory problems and compete on price without dealer markups plus gateway sold web access and a broad range of software tailored to small businesses hewlettpackards pc business had similar challenges like compaq but this was offset by hps extremely lucrative printer business while ibm sold pcs at a loss but used them to lock in multiyear services contracts with customers after pfeiffers resignation the board established an office of the ceo with a triumvirate of directors rosen as interim ceo and vice chairmen frank p doyle and robert ted enloe iii they began cleaning house as shortly afterward many of pfeiffers top executives resigned or were pushed out including john j rando earl l mason and john t rose rando senior vice president and general manager of compaq services was a key player during the merger discussions and the most senior executive from digital to remain with compaq after the acquisition closed and had been touted by some as the heirapparent to pfeiffer randos division had performed strongly as it had sales of  billion for the first quarter compared to  million in  which met expectations and was anticipated to post accelerated and profitable growth going forward at the time of randos departure compaq services ranked third behind those of ibm and eds while slightly ahead of hewlettpackards and andersen consulting however customers switched from digital and tandem technologybased workstations to those of hp ibm and sun microsystems mason senior vice president and chief financial officer had previously been offered the job of chief executive of alliant foodservice inc a foodservice distributor based in chicago and he informed compaqs board that he accepted the offer rose senior vice president and general manager of compaqs enterprise computing group resigned effective as of june  and was succeeded by tandem veteran enrico pesatori rose was reportedly upset that he was not considered for the ceo vacancy which became apparent once michael capellas was named coo while enterprise computing responsible for engineering and marketing of network servers workstations and datastorage products reportedly accounted for one third of compaqs revenues and likely the largest part of its profits it was responsible for the earnings shortfall in q of  in addition rose was part of the old guard close to former ceo pfeiffer and he and other compaq executives had been criticized at the companys annual meeting for selling stock before reporting the sales slowdown capellas was appointed coo after pressure mounted on rosen to find a permanent ceo however it was reported that potential candidates did not want to work under rosen as chairman pfeiffers permanent replacement was michael capellas who had been serving as compaqs svp and cio for under a year a couple months after pfeiffers ouster capellas was elevated to interim chief operating officer on june  and was soon appointed president and ceo capellas also assumed the title of chairman on september   when rosen stepped down from the board of directors at his retirement rosen proclaimed these are great achievements—to create  jobs  billion in sales and  billion in market value all starting with a sketch and a dream late s–sedit strugglesedit capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the pfeiffer era and he repaired the relationship with microsoft which had deteriorated under his predecessors tenure however compaq still struggled against lowercost competitors with direct sales channels such as dell who took over the top spot of pc manufacturer from compaq in  compaq relied significantly on reseller channels so their criticism caused compaq to retreat from its proposed direct sales plan although capellas maintained that he would use the middlemen to provide valueadded services despite falling to no  among pc manufacturers capellas proclaimed we are no  in the traditional pc market but were focused on industry leadership in the next generation of internet access devices and wireless mobility thats where the growth and the profitability will be the companys longerterm strategy involves extending its services to servers and storage products as well as handheld computers such as the ipaq pocketpc which accounted for  percent of total unit volume during november  compaq began to work with microsoft to create the first in a line of smallscale webbased computer systems called msn companions in  compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with navisite under the pact compaq agreed to promote and sell navisite web hosting services in return navisite took compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and intelbased servers compaq struggled as a result of the collapse of the dotcom bubble bust which hurt sales of their highend systems in  and  and they managed only a small profit in a few quarters during these years they also accumulated  billion in shortterm debt around this time the stock price of compaq which was around  when capellas became ceo was trading at half that by  acquisition by hewlettpackardedit in  compaq signed a merger agreement with hewlettpackard for  billion including  billion for goodwill where each compaq share would be exchanged for  of a hewlettpackard share there would be a termination fee of  million usd that either company would have to pay the other to break the merger compaq shareholders would own  of the combined company while hps would have  hewlettpackard had reported yearly revenues of  billion while compaqs was  billion and the combined company would have been close to ibms  billion revenues it was projected to have  billion in annual cost savings by mid the expected layoffs at compaq and hp  and  jobs respectively would leave the combined company with a workforce of  both companies had to seek approval from their shareholders through separate special meetings while compaq shareholders unanimously approved the deal there was a public proxy battle within hp as the deal was strongly opposed by numerous large hp shareholders including the sons of the company founders walter hewlett and david w packard as well as the california public employees’ retirement system calpers and the ontario teachers pension plan walter hewlett only reluctantly approved the merger in his duty as a member of the board of directors since the merger agreement called for unanimous board approval in order to ensure the best possible shareholder reception while supporters of the merger argued that there would be economies of scale and that the sales of pcs would drive sales of printers and cameras walter hewlett was convinced that pcs were a lowmargin but risky business that would not contribute and would likely dilute the old hps traditionally profitable imaging and printing division david w packard in his opposition to the deal cited massive layoffs as an example of this departure from hp’s core valuesarguing that although the founders never guaranteed job security bill and dave never developed a premeditated business strategy that treated hp employees as expendable packard further stated that fiorina’s highhanded management and her efforts to reinvent the company ran counter to the company’s core values as established by the founders the founders families who controlled a significant amount of hp shares were further irked because fiorina had made no attempt to reach out to them and consult about the merger instead they received the same standard roadshow presentation as other investors analysts on wall street were generally critical of the merger as both companies had been struggling before the announcement and the stock prices of both companies dropped in the months after the merger agreement was made public particularly rival dell made gains from defecting hp and compaq customers who were wary of the merger carly fiorina initially seen as hps savior when she was hired as ceo back in  had seen the companys stock price drop to less than half since she assumed the position and her job was said to be on shaky ground before the merger announcement hps offer was regarded by analysts to be overvaluing compaq due to compaqs shaky financial performance in the past recent years there were rumors that it could run out of money in  months and be forced to cease business operations had it stayed independent as well as compaqs own more conservative valuation of its assets detractors of the deal noted that buying compaq was a distraction that would not directly help hp take on ibms breadth or dell computers direct sales model plus there were significant cultural differences between hp and compaq which made decisions by consensus and rapid autocratic styles respectively one of compaqs few bright spots was its services business which was outperforming hps own services division the merger was approved by hp shareholders only after the narrowest of marginsclarification needed and allegations of vote buying primarily involving an alleged lastsecond backroom deal with deutsche bank haunted the new company it was subsequently disclosed that hp had retained deutsche banks investment banking division in january  to assist in the merger hp had agreed to pay deutsche bank  million guaranteed and another  million contingent upon approval of the merger on august   the us sec charged deutsche bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of  deutsche bank consented without admitting or denying the findings compaqs premerger ticker symbol was cpq this was combined with hewlettpackards ticker symbol hwp to create the current ticker symbol hpq postmergeredit former compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard united states campus capellas compaqs last chairman and ceo became president of the postmerger hewlettpackard under chairman and ceo carly fiorina to ease the integration of the two companies however capellas was reported not to be happy with his role being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become ceo as the board supported fiorina capellas stepped down on november   just six months on the job to become ceo of mci worldcom where he would lead its acquisition by verizon capellas former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the ceo fiorina helmed hp for nearly three years after capellas left hp laid off thousands of former compaq dec hp and tandem employees its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up several senior executives from the compaq side including jeff clarke and peter blackmore would resign or be ousted from the postmerger hp though the combination of both companies pc manufacturing capacity initially made it the number one it soon lost the lead and further market share to dell which squeezed hp on low end pcs hp was also unable to compete effectively with ibm in the highend server market in addition the merging of the stagnant compaq computer assembly business with hps lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized for obstructing the profitability of the printingimaging segment overall it has been suggested that the purchase of compaq was not a good move for hp due to the narrow profit margins in the commoditized pc business especially in light of ibms  announcement to sell its pc division to lenovo the inquirer noted that the continued low return on investment and small margins of hps personal computer manufacturing business now named the personal systems group continues to be what it was in the individual companies not much more than a job creation scheme for its employees in february  the board of directors ousted fiorina former compaq ceo capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor but several months afterwards mark hurd was hired as president and ceo of hp hurd separated the pc division from the imaging and printing division and renamed it the personal systems group placing it under the leadership of evp todd r bradley hewlett packards pc business has since been reinvigorated by hurds restructuring and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers by late  hp had retaken the  sales position of pcs from dell which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality and held that rank until supplanted in the mids by lenovo most compaq products have been rebranded with the hp nameplate such as the companys market leading proliant server line now owned by hewlett packard enterprise which spun off from hp in  while the compaq brand was repurposed for some of hps consumeroriented and budget products notably compaq presario pcs hps business computers line was discontinued in favour of the compaq evo line which was rebranded hp compaq hps jornada pdas were replaced by compaq ipaq pdas which were renamed hp ipaq following the merger all compaq computers were shipped with hp software post merger logo for compaq products in may  hp announced in a press release a new logo for their compaq division to be placed on the new model compaq presarios in  hp reshuffled its business line notebooks the compaq name from its hp compaq series was originally used for all of hps business and budget notebooks however the hp elitebook line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the hp compaq b series became its middle business line as of early  the hp probook filled out hps low end business lineup in  hp sold part of compaqs former headquarters to the lone star college system on august   thenceo of hp leo apotheker announced plans for a partial or full spinoff of the personal systems group the pc unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for nearly a third of hp’s overall revenues in  hp was still selling more pcs than any other vendor shipping  million pcs in the second quarter of   of the market according to gartner while dell and lenovo were tied for second place each with more than a  share of the market and shipments of over  million units however the announcement of the pc spinoff concurrent with the discontinuation of webos and the purchase of autonomy corp for  billion was poorly received by the market and after apothekers ouster plans for a divestiture were cancelled in march  the printing and imaging division was merged into the pc unit in october  according to gartner lenovo took the lead as the number one pc manufacturer from hp while idc ranked lenovo just right behind hp in q  forbes reported that lenovo ranked ahead of hp as the world’s number one pc supplier the compaq brand name was discontinued in the united states in  in

ibm and apple while other ibm pc compatible manufacturers such as packard bell and ast were driven from the market dell became the number one supplier of pcs in  at the time of their  merger compaq and hp were the second and third largest pc manufacturers so their combination made them number one however the combined hpcompaq struggled and fell to second place behind dell from – due to dells

senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer texas instruments the three of them had left due to lack of faith and loss of confidence in tis management and initially considered but ultimately decided against starting a chain of mexican restaurants each invested  to form the company which was founded with the temporary name gateway technology the name compaq was said to be derived from compatibility and quality but this explanation was an afterthought the name was chosen from many suggested by ogilvy and mather it being the name least rejected the first compaq pc was sketched out on a placemat by canion while dining with the founders in a houston pie shop their first venture capital came from benjamin m rosen and sevin rosen funds who helped the fledgling company secure  million to produce their initial computer overall the founders managed to raise  million from venture capitalists as this gave stability to the new company as well as providing assurances the dealers or middlemen unlike many startups compaq differentiated its offerings from the many other ibm clones by not focusing mainly on price but instead concentrating on new features such as portability and better graphics displays as well as performance—and all at prices comparable to those of ibm’s pcs in contrast to dell computer and gateway  compaq hired veteran engineers with an average of  years experience which lent credibility to compaqs reputation of reliability among customers due to its partnership with intel compaq was able to maintain a technological lead in the market place as it was the first one to come out with computers containing the next generation of each intel processor under canions direction compaq sold computers only through dealers to avoid potential competition that a direct sales channel would foster which helped foster loyalty among resellers by giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing compaqs offerings either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales dealers had a major incentive to advertise compaq during its first year of sales second year of operation the company sold  pcs for sales of  million the first startup to hit the  million mark that fast compaq went public in  on the nyse and raised  million in  it enjoyed record sales of  million from  pcs and became the youngestever firm to make the fortune  in  compaq hit the  billion revenue mark taking the least amount of time to reach that milestone by  compaq held the fifth place spot in the pc market with  billion in sales that year two key marketing executives in compaqs early years jim darezzo and sparky sparks had come from ibms pc group other key executives responsible for the companys meteoric growth in the late s and early s were ross a cooley another former ibm associate who served for many years as svp of gm north america michael swavely who was the companys chief marketing officer in the early years and eventually ran the north america organization later passing along that responsibility to cooley when swavely retired in the united states brendan a mac mcloughlin another long time ibm executive led the companys field sales organization after starting up the western us area of operations these executives along with other key contributors including kevin ellington douglas johns steven flannigan and gary stimac helped the company compete against the ibm corporation in all personal computer sales categories after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth the softspoken canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped compaq to attract the best talent instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper canion chose a west coaststyle campus surrounded by forests where every employee had similar offices and noone not even the ceo had a reserved parking spot at semiannual meetings turnout was high as any employee could ask questions to senior managers in  company cofounder bill murto resigned to study at a religious education program at the university of st thomas murto had helped to organize the companys marketing and authorizeddealer distribution strategy and held the post of senior vice president of sales since june  murto was succeeded by ross a cooley director of corporate sales cooley would report to michael s swavely vice president for marketing who has been given increased responsibility and the title of vice president for sales and marketing introduction of compaq portableedit compaq portable in november  compaq announced their first product the compaq portable a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer it was released in march  at  considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of todays laptop some called it a suitcase computer for its size and the look of its case it was the second ibm pc compatible being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc it was a commercial success selling  units in its first year and generating  million in sales revenue the compaq portable was the first in the range of the compaq portable series compaq was able to market a legal ibm clone because ibm mostly used off the shelf parts for their pc furthermore microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers the only part which had to be duplicated was the bios which compaq did legally by using clean room design at a cost of  million unlike other companies compaq did not bundle application software with its computers vice president of sales and service h l sparks said in early  weve considered it and every time we consider it we reject it i dont believe and our dealer network doesnt believe that bundling is the best way to merchandise those products you remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software it is perceived by a lot of people as a marketing gimmick you know when you advertise a  computer with  worth of free software it obviously cant be true the software should stand on its merits and be supported and so should the hardware why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware i think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run compaq instead emphasized pc compatibility of which future computing in may  ranked compaq as among the best examples by october  when the company announced the compaq plus with a  mb hard drive pc magazine wrote of the reputation for compatibility it built with its highly regarded floppy disk portable compaq computers remained the most compatible pc clones into  and maintained its reputation for compatibility for years even as clone bioses became available from phoenix technologies and other companies that also reverse engineered ibms design then sold their version to clone manufacturers compaq deskproedit on june   compaq released the compaq deskpro a bit desktop computer using an intel  microprocessor running at  mhz it was considerably faster than an ibm pc and was like the original compaq portable also capable of running ibm software it was compaqs first nonportable computer and began the deskpro line of computers compaq deskpro edit when compaq introduced the first pc based on intels new  microprocessor the compaq deskpro  in  it marked the first cpu change to the pc platform that was not initiated by ibm an ibmmade  machine eventually reached the market seven months later but by that time compaq was the  supplier of choice and ibm had lost its image of technical leadership for the first three months after announcement the deskpro  shipped with windows this was a version of windows  adapted for the  processor support for the virtual  mode was added by compaq engineers compaq systemproedit compaqs technical leadership and the rivalry with ibm was emphasized when the systempro server was launched in late  – this was a true server product with standard support for a second cpu and raid but also the first product to feature the eisa bus designed in reaction to ibms mca microchannel architecture which was incompatible with the original at bus although compaq had become successful by being  percent ibmcompatible it decided to continue with the original at bus—which it renamed isa—instead of licensing ibms mca prior to developing eisa compaq had invested significant resources into reverse engineering mca but its executives correctly calculated that the  billion already spent by corporations on ibmcompatible technology would make it difficult for even ibm to force manufacturers to adopt the new mca design instead of cloning mca compaq formed an alliance with hewlett packard and seven other major manufacturers known collectively as the gang of nine to develop eisa the sedit aerial map of the compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard usa campus in unincorporated harris county texas by  compaq was so influential that observers and its executives spoke of compaq compatible infoworld reported that in the isa market compaq is already ibms equal in being seen as a safe bet quoting a sellside analyst describing the company as now the safe choice in personal computers even rival tandy corporation acknowledged compaqs leadership stating that within the gang of nine when you have  people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president someone has to write the letter compaq is sitting down at the typewriter ouster of cofoundersedit michael s swavely president of compaqs north american division since may  took a sixmonth sabbatical in january  which would eventually become retirement effective on july   eckhard pfeiffer then president of compaq international was named to succeed him pfeiffer also received the title of chief operating officer with responsibility for the companys operations on a worldwide basis so that canion could devote more time to strategy swavelys abrupt departure in january led to rumors of turmoil in compaqs executive suite including friction between canion and swavely likely as swavelys rival pfeiffer had received the number two leadership position swavelys u s marketing organization was losing ground with only  growth for compaq versus  in the market likely due to short supplies of the lte s from component shortages rivals that undercut compaqs prices by as much as  and large customers who did not like compaqs dealeronly policy pfeiffer became president and ceo of compaq later that year as a result of a boardroom coup led by board chairman ben rosen that forced cofounder rod canion to resign as president and ceo pfeiffer had joined compaq from texas instruments and established operations from scratch in both europe and asia pfeiffer was given  usd to start up compaq europe he started up compaqs first overseas office in munich in  by  compaq europe was a  billion business and number two behind ibm in that region and foreign sales contributed  percent of compaqs revenues pfeiffer while transplanting compaqs u s strategy of dealeronly distribution to europe was more selective in signing up dealers than compaq had been in the u s such that european dealers were more qualified to handle its increasingly complex products during the s under canions direction compaq had focused on engineering research and quality control producing highend highperformance machines with high profit margins that allowed compaq to continue investing in engineering and nextgeneration technology this strategy was successful as compaq was considered a trusted brand while many other ibm clones were untrusted due to being plagued by poor reliability however by the end of the eighties many manufacturers had improved their quality and were able to produce inexpensive pcs with offtheshelf components incurring none of the rd costs which allowed them to undercut compaqs expensive computers faced with lowercost rivals such as dell computer ast research and gateway  compaq suffered a  million loss for that quarter their first loss as a company while the stock had dropped by over twothirds an analyst stated that compaq has made a lot of tactical errors in the last year and a half they were trendsetters now they are lagging canion initially believed that the s recession was responsible for compaqs declining sales but insisted that they would recover once the economy improved however pfeiffers observation of the european market noted that it was competition as rivals could match compaq at a fraction of the cost under pressure from compaqs board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their houston headquarters despite falling us sales while the number of nonus employees had stayed constant compaq made its firstever layoffs  employees which was  of its workforce while pfeiffer was promoted to evp and coo rosen and canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper asian pc imports as canion wanted compaq to build lower cost pcs with components developed inhouse in order to preserve compaqs reputation for engineering and quality while rosen believed that compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster while canion developed an month plan to create a line of lowpriced computers rosen sent his own compaq engineering team to comdex without canions knowledge and discovered that a lowpriced pc could be made in half the time and at lower cost than canions initiative it was also believedby whom that canions consensusstyle management slowed the companys ability to react in the market whereas pfeiffers autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition rosen initiated a hour board meeting and the directors also interviewed pfeiffer for several hours without informing canion at the conclusion the board was unanimous in picking pfeiffer over canion as canion was popular with company workers  employees staged an impromptu protest with signs stating we love you rod and taking out a newspaper ad saying rod you are the wind beneath our wings we love you canion declined an offer to remain on compaqs board and was bitter about his ouster as he didnt speak to rosen for years although their relationship became cordial again in  canion admitted that his ouster was justified saying i was burned out i needed to leave he rosen felt i didnt have a strong sense of urgency two weeks after canions ouster five other senior executives resigned including remaining company founder james harris as svp of engineering these departures were motivated by an enhanced severance or early retirement as well as an imminent demotion as their functions were to be shifted to vice presidents market ascensionedit under pfeiffers tenure as chief executive compaq entered the retail computer market with the compaq presario as one of the first manufacturers in the mids to market a sub pc in order to maintain the prices it wanted compaq became the first firsttier computer manufacturer to utilize cpus from amd and cyrix the two price wars resulting from compaqs actions ultimately drove numerous competitors from the market such as packard bell and ast research from third place in  compaq had overtaken apple computer and even surpassed ibm as the top pc manufacturer in  as both ibm and apple were struggling considerably during that time compaqs inventory and gross margins were better than that of its rivals which enabled it to wage the price wars compaq had decided to make a foray into printers in  and the first models were released to positive reviews in  however pfeiffer saw that the prospects of taking on market leader hewlett packard who had  market share was tough as that would force compaq to devote more funds and people to that project than originally budgeted compaq ending up selling the printer business to xerox and took a charge of  million on june   compaq reached an agreement with cisco systems inc in order to get into networking including digital modems routers and switches favored by small businesses and corporate departments which was now a  billion business and the fastestgrowing part of the computer hardware market compaq also built up a network engineering and marketing staff management shuffleedit in  despite record sales and profits at compaq pfeiffer initiated a major management shakeup in the senior ranks john t rose who previously ran compaqs desktop pc division took over the corporate server business from svp gary stimac who had resigned rose had joined compaq in  from digital equipment corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering while stimac had been with compaq since  and was one of the longestserving executives senior vicepresident for north america ross cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of  cfo daryl j white who joined the company in january  resigned in may  after  years as cfo michael winkler who joined compaq in  to run its portable computer division was promoted to general manager of the new pc products group earl mason hired from inland steel effective on may  immediately made an impact as the new cfo under masons guidance compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits which increased compaqs cash from  million to nearly  billion in one year also compaqs return on invested capital aftertax operating profit divided by operating assets has doubled to  percent from  percent in that period compaq had been producing the pc chassis at its plant in shenzhen china to cut costs in  instead of expanding its own plant compaq asked a taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals with the taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached compaq in houston pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy to build pcs madetoorder which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software vicepresident for corporate development kenneth e kurtzman assembled five teams to examine compaqs businesses and assess each units strategy and that of key rivals kurtzmans teams recommended to pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years—or else compaq should exit that line also the company should no longer use profits from highmargin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones as instead each unit must show a return on investment pfeiffers vision was to make compaq a fullfledged computer company moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail pcs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that ibm did well at such as computer servers which would also require more customer handholding from either the dealers or compaq staff themselves unlike ibm and hp compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers inhouse as these could be costly assets instead compaq would leverage its partnerships including these with andersen consulting and software maker sap to install and maintain corporate systems this allowed compaq to compete in the bigiron market without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses in january  compaq was at its height ceo pfeiffer boldly predicted that the microsoftintel wintel duopoly would be replaced by wintelpaq acquisitionsedit pfeiffer also made several major and some minor acquisitions in  compaq bought tandem computers known for their nonstop server line this acquisition instantly gave compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included networth  based in irving texas and thomasconrad  based in austin texas in  microcom was also acquired based in norwood ma which brought a line of modems remote access servers ras and the popular carbon copy software in  compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a thenindustry record of  billion usd the merger made compaq at the time the worlds second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm digital equipment which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue had been a leading computer company during the s and early s however digital had struggled during the s with high operating costs for nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even and had recently refocused itself as a network solutions company in  compaq had considered a bid for digital but only became seriously interested in  after digitals major divestments and refocusing on the internet at the time of the acquisition services accounted for  percent of digitals revenues about  billion and their gross margins on services averaged  percent considerably higher than compaqs  margins on pc sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from compaq for years compaq had originally wanted to purchase only digitals services business but that was turned down when the announcement was made it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave compaq a  person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases by  services made up over  of compaqs revenues largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger in order to compete with ibm however it was also risky merger as the combined company would have to lay off  employees from compaq and  from digital which would potentially hurt morale furthermore compaq fell behind schedule in integrating digitals operations which also distracted the company from its strength in lowend pcs where it used to lead the market in rolling out nextgeneration systems which let rival dell grab market share reportedly compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate digital alone however pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market mark anderson president of strategic news service a research firm based in friday harbor wash was quoted as saying the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders – like being a  billion company by the year  or to beat ibm – but they didnt have anything to do with customers the new ceo should look at everything eckhard acquired and ask did the customer benefit from that if the answer isnt yes they should get rid of it on one hand compaq had previously dominated the pc market with its price war but was now struggling against dell which sold directly to buyers avoiding the dealer channel and its markup and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum at the same time compaq through its acquisitions of the digital equipment corporation last year and tandem computer in  had tried to become a major systems company like ibm and hewlettpackard while ibm and hp were able generate repeat business from corporate customers to drive sales of their different divisions compaq had not yet managed to make its newly acquired sales and services organizations work as seamlessly ouster of pfeifferedit in early  compaq had the problem of bloated pc inventories by summer  compaq was suffering from productquality problems robert w stearns svp of business development said in pfeiffers quest for bigness he lost an understanding of the customer and built what i call empty market sharelarge but not profitable while jim moore a technology strategy consultant with geopartners research in cambridge mass says pfeiffer raced to scale without having economies of scale the colossus that pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fastchanging computer industry that year compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many pcs causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices and since compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits pfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor rebuffing rosens suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of compaq president the board complained that pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rankandfile as he surrounded himself with a clique of chief financial officer earl mason senior vicepresident john t rose and senior vicepresident of human resources hans gutsch current and former compaq employees complained that gutsch was part of a group of senior executives dubbed the a team who controlled access to pfeiffer gutsch was said to be a master of corporate politics pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview gutsch who oversaw security had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca where the companys senior vice presidents worked there were accusations that gutsch and others sought to divide top management although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of tandem and digital equipment corp pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks saying we cut the team down to the minimum number of people  those who would have to be directly involved and not one person more robert w stearns compaqs senior vice president for business development with responsibility for mergers and acquisitions had opposed the acquisition of digital as the cultural differences between both companies were too great and complained that he was placed on the b team as a result compaq entered  with strong expectations fourthquarter  earnings reported in january  beat expectations by six cents a share with record  percent growth the company launched compaqcom as the key for its new direct sales strategy and planned an ipo for altavista toward the end of  in order to capitalize on the dotcom bubble however by february  analysts were sceptical of compaqs plan to sell both direct and to resellers compaq was hit with two classaction lawsuits as a result of cfo earl mason svp john rose and other executives selling  million usd of stock before a conference call with analysts where they noted that demand for pcs was slowing down on april   just nine days after compaq reported firstquarter profit being at half of what analysts had expected the latest in a string of earnings disappointments pfeiffer was forced to resign as ceo in a coup led by board chairman ben rosen reportedly at the special board meeting held on april  the directors were unanimous in dismissing pfeiffer the companys stock had fallen  percent since its alltime high in january  compaq shares which traded as high as  early in  dropped  percent on april  the first day of trading after the firstquarter announcement and closed the following friday at  during three out of the last six quarters of pfeiffers tenure the companys revenues or earnings had missed expectations while rival dell computer had  growth in us pc sales in the first quarter of  compaq could only manage  rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the internet had overtaken compaqs management team saying as a company engaged in transforming its industry for the internet era we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at internet speed in a statement pfeiffer said compaq has come a long way since i joined the company in  and under bens guidance i know this company will realize its potential rosens priority was to have compaq catchup as an ecommerce competitor and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company roger kay an analyst at international data corporation observed that compaqs behavior at times seemed like a personal vendetta noting that eckhard has been so obsessed with staying ahead of dell that they focused too hard on market share and stopped paying attention to profitability and liquidity they got whacked in a price war that they started subsequent earnings releases from compaqs rivals dell gateway ibm and hewlettpackard suggested that the problems were not affecting the whole pc industry as pfeiffer had suggested dell and gateway sold direct which helped them to avoid compaqs inventory problems and compete on price without dealer markups plus gateway sold web access and a broad range of software tailored to small businesses hewlettpackards pc business had similar challenges like compaq but this was offset by hps extremely lucrative printer business while ibm sold pcs at a loss but used them to lock in multiyear services contracts with customers after pfeiffers resignation the board established an office of the ceo with a triumvirate of directors rosen as interim ceo and vice chairmen frank p doyle and robert ted enloe iii they began cleaning house as shortly afterward many of pfeiffers top executives resigned or were pushed out including john j rando earl l mason and john t rose rando senior vice president and general manager of compaq services was a key player during the merger discussions and the most senior executive from digital to remain with compaq after the acquisition closed and had been touted by some as the heirapparent to pfeiffer randos division had performed strongly as it had sales of  billion for the first quarter compared to  million in  which met expectations and was anticipated to post accelerated and profitable growth going forward at the time of randos departure compaq services ranked third behind those of ibm and eds while slightly ahead of hewlettpackards and andersen consulting however customers switched from digital and tandem technologybased workstations to those of hp ibm and sun microsystems mason senior vice president and chief financial officer had previously been offered the job of chief executive of alliant foodservice inc a foodservice distributor based in chicago and he informed compaqs board that he accepted the offer rose senior vice president and general manager of compaqs enterprise computing group resigned effective as of june  and was succeeded by tandem veteran enrico pesatori rose was reportedly upset that he was not considered for the ceo vacancy which became apparent once michael capellas was named coo while enterprise computing responsible for engineering and marketing of network servers workstations and datastorage products reportedly accounted for one third of compaqs revenues and likely the largest part of its profits it was responsible for the earnings shortfall in q of  in addition rose was part of the old guard close to former ceo pfeiffer and he and other compaq executives had been criticized at the companys annual meeting for selling stock before reporting the sales slowdown capellas was appointed coo after pressure mounted on rosen to find a permanent ceo however it was reported that potential candidates did not want to work under rosen as chairman pfeiffers permanent replacement was michael capellas who had been serving as compaqs svp and cio for under a year a couple months after pfeiffers ouster capellas was elevated to interim chief operating officer on june  and was soon appointed president and ceo capellas also assumed the title of chairman on september   when rosen stepped down from the board of directors at his retirement rosen proclaimed these are great achievements—to create  jobs  billion in sales and  billion in market value all starting with a sketch and a dream late s–sedit strugglesedit capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the pfeiffer era and he repaired the relationship with microsoft which had deteriorated under his predecessors tenure however compaq still struggled against lowercost competitors with direct sales channels such as dell who took over the top spot of pc manufacturer from compaq in  compaq relied significantly on reseller channels so their criticism caused compaq to retreat from its proposed direct sales plan although capellas maintained that he would use the middlemen to provide valueadded services despite falling to no  among pc manufacturers capellas proclaimed we are no  in the traditional pc market but were focused on industry leadership in the next generation of internet access devices and wireless mobility thats where the growth and the profitability will be the companys longerterm strategy involves extending its services to servers and storage products as well as handheld computers such as the ipaq pocketpc which accounted for  percent of total unit volume during november  compaq began to work with microsoft to create the first in a line of smallscale webbased computer systems called msn companions in  compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with navisite under the pact compaq agreed to promote and sell navisite web hosting services in return navisite took compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and intelbased servers compaq struggled as a result of the collapse of the dotcom bubble bust which hurt sales of their highend systems in  and  and they managed only a small profit in a few quarters during these years they also accumulated  billion in shortterm debt around this time the stock price of compaq which was around  when capellas became ceo was trading at half that by  acquisition by hewlettpackardedit in  compaq signed a merger agreement with hewlettpackard for  billion including  billion for goodwill where each compaq share would be exchanged for  of a hewlettpackard share there would be a termination fee of  million usd that either company would have to pay the other to break the merger compaq shareholders would own  of the combined company while hps would have  hewlettpackard had reported yearly revenues of  billion while compaqs was  billion and the combined company would have been close to ibms  billion revenues it was projected to have  billion in annual cost savings by mid the expected layoffs at compaq and hp  and  jobs respectively would leave the combined company with a workforce of  both companies had to seek approval from their shareholders through separate special meetings while compaq shareholders unanimously approved the deal there was a public proxy battle within hp as the deal was strongly opposed by numerous large hp shareholders including the sons of the company founders walter hewlett and david w packard as well as the california public employees’ retirement system calpers and the ontario teachers pension plan walter hewlett only reluctantly approved the merger in his duty as a member of the board of directors since the merger agreement called for unanimous board approval in order to ensure the best possible shareholder reception while supporters of the merger argued that there would be economies of scale and that the sales of pcs would drive sales of printers and cameras walter hewlett was convinced that pcs were a lowmargin but risky business that would not contribute and would likely dilute the old hps traditionally profitable imaging and printing division david w packard in his opposition to the deal cited massive layoffs as an example of this departure from hp’s core valuesarguing that although the founders never guaranteed job security bill and dave never developed a premeditated business strategy that treated hp employees as expendable packard further stated that fiorina’s highhanded management and her efforts to reinvent the company ran counter to the company’s core values as established by the founders the founders families who controlled a significant amount of hp shares were further irked because fiorina had made no attempt to reach out to them and consult about the merger instead they received the same standard roadshow presentation as other investors analysts on wall street were generally critical of the merger as both companies had been struggling before the announcement and the stock prices of both companies dropped in the months after the merger agreement was made public particularly rival dell made gains from defecting hp and compaq customers who were wary of the merger carly fiorina initially seen as hps savior when she was hired as ceo back in  had seen the companys stock price drop to less than half since she assumed the position and her job was said to be on shaky ground before the merger announcement hps offer was regarded by analysts to be overvaluing compaq due to compaqs shaky financial performance in the past recent years there were rumors that it could run out of money in  months and be forced to cease business operations had it stayed independent as well as compaqs own more conservative valuation of its assets detractors of the deal noted that buying compaq was a distraction that would not directly help hp take on ibms breadth or dell computers direct sales model plus there were significant cultural differences between hp and compaq which made decisions by consensus and rapid autocratic styles respectively one of compaqs few bright spots was its services business which was outperforming hps own services division the merger was approved by hp shareholders only after the narrowest of marginsclarification needed and allegations of vote buying primarily involving an alleged lastsecond backroom deal with deutsche bank haunted the new company it was subsequently disclosed that hp had retained deutsche banks investment banking division in january  to assist in the merger hp had agreed to pay deutsche bank  million guaranteed and another  million contingent upon approval of the merger on august   the us sec charged deutsche bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of  deutsche bank consented without admitting or denying the findings compaqs premerger ticker symbol was cpq this was combined with hewlettpackards ticker symbol hwp to create the current ticker symbol hpq postmergeredit former compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard united states campus capellas compaqs last chairman and ceo became president of the postmerger hewlettpackard under chairman and ceo carly fiorina to ease the integration of the two companies however capellas was reported not to be happy with his role being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become ceo as the board supported fiorina capellas stepped down on november   just six months on the job to become ceo of mci worldcom where he would lead its acquisition by verizon capellas former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the ceo fiorina helmed hp for nearly three years after capellas left hp laid off thousands of former compaq dec hp and tandem employees its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up several senior executives from the compaq side including jeff clarke and peter blackmore would resign or be ousted from the postmerger hp though the combination of both companies pc manufacturing capacity initially made it the number one it soon lost the lead and further market share to dell which squeezed hp on low end pcs hp was also unable to compete effectively with ibm in the highend server market in addition the merging of the stagnant compaq computer assembly business with hps lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized for obstructing the profitability of the printingimaging segment overall it has been suggested that the purchase of compaq was not a good move for hp due to the narrow profit margins in the commoditized pc business especially in light of ibms  announcement to sell its pc division to lenovo the inquirer noted that the continued low return on investment and small margins of hps personal computer manufacturing business now named the personal systems group continues to be what it was in the individual companies not much more than a job creation scheme for its employees in february  the board of directors ousted fiorina former compaq ceo capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor but several months afterwards mark hurd was hired as president and ceo of hp hurd separated the pc division from the imaging and printing division and renamed it the personal systems group placing it under the leadership of evp todd r bradley hewlett packards pc business has since been reinvigorated by hurds restructuring and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers by late  hp had retaken the  sales position of pcs from dell which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality and held that rank until supplanted in the mids by lenovo most compaq products have been rebranded with the hp nameplate such as the companys market leading proliant server line now owned by hewlett packard enterprise which spun off from hp in  while the compaq brand was repurposed for some of hps consumeroriented and budget products notably

however the hp elitebook line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the hp compaq b series became its middle business line as of early  the hp probook filled out hps low end business lineup in  hp sold part of compaqs former headquarters to the lone star college system on august   thenceo of hp leo apotheker announced plans for a partial or full spinoff of the personal systems group the pc unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for nearly a third of hp’s overall revenues in  hp was still selling more pcs than any other vendor shipping  million pcs in the second quarter of   of the market according to gartner while dell and lenovo were tied for second place each with more than a  share of the market and shipments of over  million units however the announcement of the pc spinoff concurrent with the discontinuation of webos and the purchase of autonomy corp for  billion was poorly received by the market and after apothekers ouster plans for a divestiture were cancelled in march  the printing and imaging division was merged into the pc unit in october  according to gartner lenovo took the lead as the number one pc manufacturer from hp while idc ranked lenovo just right behind hp in q  forbes reported that lenovo ranked ahead of hp as the world’s number one pc supplier the compaq brand name was discontinued in the united states in  in

ibm and apple while other ibm pc compatible manufacturers such as packard bell and ast were driven from the market dell became the number one supplier of pcs in  at the time of their  merger compaq and hp were the second and third largest pc manufacturers so their combination made them number one however the combined hpcompaq struggled and fell to second place behind dell from – due to dells struggles in late  hp has led all pc vendors since  onwards during its existence as a division of hp compaq primarily competed against other budgetoriented personal computer series from manufacturers

senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer texas instruments the three of them had left due to lack of faith and loss of confidence in tis management and initially considered but ultimately decided against starting a chain of mexican restaurants each invested  to form the company which was founded with the temporary name gateway technology the name compaq was said to be derived from compatibility and quality but this explanation was an afterthought the name was chosen from many suggested by ogilvy and mather it being the name least rejected the first compaq pc was sketched out on a placemat by canion while dining with the founders in a houston pie shop their first venture capital came from benjamin m rosen and sevin rosen funds who helped the fledgling company secure  million to produce their initial computer overall the founders managed to raise  million from venture capitalists as this gave stability to the new company as well as providing assurances the dealers or middlemen unlike many startups compaq differentiated its offerings from the many other ibm clones by not focusing mainly on price but instead concentrating on new features such as portability and better graphics displays as well as performance—and all at prices comparable to those of ibm’s pcs in contrast to dell computer and gateway  compaq hired veteran engineers with an average of  years experience which lent credibility to compaqs reputation of reliability among customers due to its partnership with intel compaq was able to maintain a technological lead in the market place as it was the first one to come out with computers containing the next generation of each intel processor under canions direction compaq sold computers only through dealers to avoid potential competition that a direct sales channel would foster which helped foster loyalty among resellers by giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing compaqs offerings either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales dealers had a major incentive to advertise compaq during its first year of sales second year of operation the company sold  pcs for sales of  million the first startup to hit the  million mark that fast compaq went public in  on the nyse and raised  million in  it enjoyed record sales of  million from  pcs and became the youngestever firm to make the fortune  in  compaq hit the  billion revenue mark taking the least amount of time to reach that milestone by  compaq held the fifth place spot in the pc market with  billion in sales that year two key marketing executives in compaqs early years jim darezzo and sparky sparks had come from ibms pc group other key executives responsible for the companys meteoric growth in the late s and early s were ross a cooley another former ibm associate who served for many years as svp of gm north america michael swavely who was the companys chief marketing officer in the early years and eventually ran the north america organization later passing along that responsibility to cooley when swavely retired in the united states brendan a mac mcloughlin another long time ibm executive led the companys field sales organization after starting up the western us area of operations these executives along with other key contributors including kevin ellington douglas johns steven flannigan and gary stimac helped the company compete against the ibm corporation in all personal computer sales categories after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth the softspoken canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped compaq to attract the best talent instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper canion chose a west coaststyle campus surrounded by forests where every employee had similar offices and noone not even the ceo had a reserved parking spot at semiannual meetings turnout was high as any employee could ask questions to senior managers in  company cofounder bill murto resigned to study at a religious education program at the university of st thomas murto had helped to organize the companys marketing and authorizeddealer distribution strategy and held the post of senior vice president of sales since june  murto was succeeded by ross a cooley director of corporate sales cooley would report to michael s swavely vice president for marketing who has been given increased responsibility and the title of vice president for sales and marketing introduction of compaq portableedit compaq portable in november  compaq announced their first product the compaq portable a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer it was released in march  at  considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of todays laptop some called it a suitcase computer for its size and the look of its case it was the second ibm pc compatible being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc it was a commercial success selling  units in its first year and generating  million in sales revenue the compaq portable was the first in the range of the compaq portable series compaq was able to market a legal ibm clone because ibm mostly used off the shelf parts for their pc furthermore microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers the only part which had to be duplicated was the bios which compaq did legally by using clean room design at a cost of  million unlike other companies compaq did not bundle application software with its computers vice president of sales and service h l sparks said in early  weve considered it and every time we consider it we reject it i dont believe and our dealer network doesnt believe that bundling is the best way to merchandise those products you remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software it is perceived by a lot of people as a marketing gimmick you know when you advertise a  computer with  worth of free software it obviously cant be true the software should stand on its merits and be supported and so should the hardware why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware i think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run compaq instead emphasized pc compatibility of which future computing in may  ranked compaq as among the best examples by october  when the company announced the compaq plus with a  mb hard drive pc magazine wrote of the reputation for compatibility it built with its highly regarded floppy disk portable compaq computers remained the most compatible pc clones into  and maintained its reputation for compatibility for years even as clone bioses became available from phoenix technologies and other companies that also reverse engineered ibms design then sold their version to clone manufacturers compaq deskproedit on june   compaq released the compaq deskpro a bit desktop computer using an intel  microprocessor running at  mhz it was considerably faster than an ibm pc and was like the original compaq portable also capable of running ibm software it was compaqs first nonportable computer and began the deskpro line of computers compaq deskpro edit when compaq introduced the first pc based on intels new  microprocessor the compaq deskpro  in  it marked the first cpu change to the pc platform that was not initiated by ibm an ibmmade  machine eventually reached the market seven months later but by that time compaq was the  supplier of choice and ibm had lost its image of technical leadership for the first three months after announcement the deskpro  shipped with windows this was a version of windows  adapted for the  processor support for the virtual  mode was added by compaq engineers compaq systemproedit compaqs technical leadership and the rivalry with ibm was emphasized when the systempro server was launched in late  – this was a true server product with standard support for a second cpu and raid but also the first product to feature the eisa bus designed in reaction to ibms mca microchannel architecture which was incompatible with the original at bus although compaq had become successful by being  percent ibmcompatible it decided to continue with the original at bus—which it renamed isa—instead of licensing ibms mca prior to developing eisa compaq had invested significant resources into reverse engineering mca but its executives correctly calculated that the  billion already spent by corporations on ibmcompatible technology would make it difficult for even ibm to force manufacturers to adopt the new mca design instead of cloning mca compaq formed an alliance with hewlett packard and seven other major manufacturers known collectively as the gang of nine to develop eisa the sedit aerial map of the compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard usa campus in unincorporated harris county texas by  compaq was so influential that observers and its executives spoke of compaq compatible infoworld reported that in the isa market compaq is already ibms equal in being seen as a safe bet quoting a sellside analyst describing the company as now the safe choice in personal computers even rival tandy corporation acknowledged compaqs leadership stating that within the gang of nine when you have  people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president someone has to write the letter compaq is sitting down at the typewriter ouster of cofoundersedit michael s swavely president of compaqs north american division since may  took a sixmonth sabbatical in january  which would eventually become retirement effective on july   eckhard pfeiffer then president of compaq international was named to succeed him pfeiffer also received the title of chief operating officer with responsibility for the companys operations on a worldwide basis so that canion could devote more time to strategy swavelys abrupt departure in january led to rumors of turmoil in compaqs executive suite including friction between canion and swavely likely as swavelys rival pfeiffer had received the number two leadership position swavelys u s marketing organization was losing ground with only  growth for compaq versus  in the market likely due to short supplies of the lte s from component shortages rivals that undercut compaqs prices by as much as  and large customers who did not like compaqs dealeronly policy pfeiffer became president and ceo of compaq later that year as a result of a boardroom coup led by board chairman ben rosen that forced cofounder rod canion to resign as president and ceo pfeiffer had joined compaq from texas instruments and established operations from scratch in both europe and asia pfeiffer was given  usd to start up compaq europe he started up compaqs first overseas office in munich in  by  compaq europe was a  billion business and number two behind ibm in that region and foreign sales contributed  percent of compaqs revenues pfeiffer while transplanting compaqs u s strategy of dealeronly distribution to europe was more selective in signing up dealers than compaq had been in the u s such that european dealers were more qualified to handle its increasingly complex products during the s under canions direction compaq had focused on engineering research and quality control producing highend highperformance machines with high profit margins that allowed compaq to continue investing in engineering and nextgeneration technology this strategy was successful as compaq was considered a trusted brand while many other ibm clones were untrusted due to being plagued by poor reliability however by the end of the eighties many manufacturers had improved their quality and were able to produce inexpensive pcs with offtheshelf components incurring none of the rd costs which allowed them to undercut compaqs expensive computers faced with lowercost rivals such as dell computer ast research and gateway  compaq suffered a  million loss for that quarter their first loss as a company while the stock had dropped by over twothirds an analyst stated that compaq has made a lot of tactical errors in the last year and a half they were trendsetters now they are lagging canion initially believed that the s recession was responsible for compaqs declining sales but insisted that they would recover once the economy improved however pfeiffers observation of the european market noted that it was competition as rivals could match compaq at a fraction of the cost under pressure from compaqs board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their houston headquarters despite falling us sales while the number of nonus employees had stayed constant compaq made its firstever layoffs  employees which was  of its workforce while pfeiffer was promoted to evp and coo rosen and canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper asian pc imports as canion wanted compaq to build lower cost pcs with components developed inhouse in order to preserve compaqs reputation for engineering and quality while rosen believed that compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster while canion developed an month plan to create a line of lowpriced computers rosen sent his own compaq engineering team to comdex without canions knowledge and discovered that a lowpriced pc could be made in half the time and at lower cost than canions initiative it was also believedby whom that canions consensusstyle management slowed the companys ability to react in the market whereas pfeiffers autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition rosen initiated a hour board meeting and the directors also interviewed pfeiffer for several hours without informing canion at the conclusion the board was unanimous in picking pfeiffer over canion as canion was popular with company workers  employees staged an impromptu protest with signs stating we love you rod and taking out a newspaper ad saying rod you are the wind beneath our wings we love you canion declined an offer to remain on compaqs board and was bitter about his ouster as he didnt speak to rosen for years although their relationship became cordial again in  canion admitted that his ouster was justified saying i was burned out i needed to leave he rosen felt i didnt have a strong sense of urgency two weeks after canions ouster five other senior executives resigned including remaining company founder james harris as svp of engineering these departures were motivated by an enhanced severance or early retirement as well as an imminent demotion as their functions were to be shifted to vice presidents market ascensionedit under pfeiffers tenure as chief executive compaq entered the retail computer market with the compaq presario as one of the first manufacturers in the mids to market a sub pc in order to maintain the prices it wanted compaq became the first firsttier computer manufacturer to utilize cpus from amd and cyrix the two price wars resulting from compaqs actions ultimately drove numerous competitors from the market such as packard bell and ast research from third place in  compaq had overtaken apple computer and even surpassed ibm as the top pc manufacturer in  as both ibm and apple were struggling considerably during that time compaqs inventory and gross margins were better than that of its rivals which enabled it to wage the price wars compaq had decided to make a foray into printers in  and the first models were released to positive reviews in  however pfeiffer saw that the prospects of taking on market leader hewlett packard who had  market share was tough as that would force compaq to devote more funds and people to that project than originally budgeted compaq ending up selling the printer business to xerox and took a charge of  million on june   compaq reached an agreement with cisco systems inc in order to get into networking including digital modems routers and switches favored by small businesses and corporate departments which was now a  billion business and the fastestgrowing part of the computer hardware market compaq also built up a network engineering and marketing staff management shuffleedit in  despite record sales and profits at compaq pfeiffer initiated a major management shakeup in the senior ranks john t rose who previously ran compaqs desktop pc division took over the corporate server business from svp gary stimac who had resigned rose had joined compaq in  from digital equipment corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering while stimac had been with compaq since  and was one of the longestserving executives senior vicepresident for north america ross cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of  cfo daryl j white who joined the company in january  resigned in may  after  years as cfo michael winkler who joined compaq in  to run its portable computer division was promoted to general manager of the new pc products group earl mason hired from inland steel effective on may  immediately made an impact as the new cfo under masons guidance compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits which increased compaqs cash from  million to nearly  billion in one year also compaqs return on invested capital aftertax operating profit divided by operating assets has doubled to  percent from  percent in that period compaq had been producing the pc chassis at its plant in shenzhen china to cut costs in  instead of expanding its own plant compaq asked a taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals with the taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached compaq in houston pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy to build pcs madetoorder which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software vicepresident for corporate development kenneth e kurtzman assembled five teams to examine compaqs businesses and assess each units strategy and that of key rivals kurtzmans teams recommended to pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years—or else compaq should exit that line also the company should no longer use profits from highmargin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones as instead each unit must show a return on investment pfeiffers vision was to make compaq a fullfledged computer company moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail pcs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that ibm did well at such as computer servers which would also require more customer handholding from either the dealers or compaq staff themselves unlike ibm and hp compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers inhouse as these could be costly assets instead compaq would leverage its partnerships including these with andersen consulting and software maker sap to install and maintain corporate systems this allowed compaq to compete in the bigiron market without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses in january  compaq was at its height ceo pfeiffer boldly predicted that the microsoftintel wintel duopoly would be replaced by wintelpaq acquisitionsedit pfeiffer also made several major and some minor acquisitions in  compaq bought tandem computers known for their nonstop server line this acquisition instantly gave compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included networth  based in irving texas and thomasconrad  based in austin texas in  microcom was also acquired based in norwood ma which brought a line of modems remote access servers ras and the popular carbon copy software in  compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a thenindustry record of  billion usd the merger made compaq at the time the worlds second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm digital equipment which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue had been a leading computer company during the s and early s however digital had struggled during the s with high operating costs for nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even and had recently refocused itself as a network solutions company in  compaq had considered a bid for digital but only became seriously interested in  after digitals major divestments and refocusing on the internet at the time of the acquisition services accounted for  percent of digitals revenues about  billion and their gross margins on services averaged  percent considerably higher than compaqs  margins on pc sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from compaq for years compaq had originally wanted to purchase only digitals services business but that was turned down when the announcement was made it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave compaq a  person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases by  services made up over  of compaqs revenues largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger in order to compete with ibm however it was also risky merger as the combined company would have to lay off  employees from compaq and  from digital which would potentially hurt morale furthermore compaq fell behind schedule in integrating digitals operations which also distracted the company from its strength in lowend pcs where it used to lead the market in rolling out nextgeneration systems which let rival dell grab market share reportedly compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate digital alone however pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market mark anderson president of strategic news service a research firm based in friday harbor wash was quoted as saying the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders – like being a  billion company by the year  or to beat ibm – but they didnt have anything to do with customers the new ceo should look at everything eckhard acquired and ask did the customer benefit from that if the answer isnt yes they should get rid of it on one hand compaq had previously dominated the pc market with its price war but was now struggling against dell which sold directly to buyers avoiding the dealer channel and its markup and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum at the same time compaq through its acquisitions of the digital equipment corporation last year and tandem computer in  had tried to become a major systems company like ibm and hewlettpackard while ibm and hp were able generate repeat business from corporate customers to drive sales of their different divisions compaq had not yet managed to make its newly acquired sales and services organizations work as seamlessly ouster of pfeifferedit in early  compaq had the problem of bloated pc inventories by summer  compaq was suffering from productquality problems robert w stearns svp of business development said in pfeiffers quest for bigness he lost an understanding of the customer and built what i call empty market sharelarge but not profitable while jim moore a technology strategy consultant with geopartners research in cambridge mass says pfeiffer raced to scale without having economies of scale the colossus that pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fastchanging computer industry that year compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many pcs causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices and since compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits pfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor rebuffing rosens suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of compaq president the board complained that pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rankandfile as he surrounded himself with a clique of chief financial officer earl mason senior vicepresident john t rose and senior vicepresident of human resources hans gutsch current and former compaq employees complained that gutsch was part of a group of senior executives dubbed the a team who controlled access to pfeiffer gutsch was said to be a master of corporate politics pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview gutsch who oversaw security had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca where the companys senior vice presidents worked there were accusations that gutsch and others sought to divide top management although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of tandem and digital equipment corp pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks saying we cut the team down to the minimum number of people  those who would have to be directly involved and not one person more robert w stearns compaqs senior vice president for business development with responsibility for mergers and acquisitions had opposed the acquisition of digital as the cultural differences between both companies were too great and complained that he was placed on the b team as a result compaq entered  with strong expectations fourthquarter  earnings reported in january  beat expectations by six cents a share with record  percent growth the company launched compaqcom as the key for its new direct sales strategy and planned an ipo for altavista toward the end of  in order to capitalize on the dotcom bubble however by february  analysts were sceptical of compaqs plan to sell both direct and to resellers compaq was hit with two classaction lawsuits as a result of cfo earl mason svp john rose and other executives selling  million usd of stock before a conference call with analysts where they noted that demand for pcs was slowing down on april   just nine days after compaq reported firstquarter profit being at half of what analysts had expected the latest in a string of earnings disappointments pfeiffer was forced to resign as ceo in a coup led by board chairman ben rosen reportedly at the special board meeting held on april  the directors were unanimous in dismissing pfeiffer the companys stock had fallen  percent since its alltime high in january  compaq shares which traded as high as  early in  dropped  percent on april  the first day of trading after the firstquarter announcement and closed the following friday at  during three out of the last six quarters of pfeiffers tenure the companys revenues or earnings had missed expectations while rival dell computer had  growth in us pc sales in the first quarter of  compaq could only manage  rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the internet had overtaken compaqs management team saying as a company engaged in transforming its industry for the internet era we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at internet speed in a statement pfeiffer said compaq has come a long way since i joined the company in  and under bens guidance i know this company will realize its potential rosens priority was to have compaq catchup as an ecommerce competitor and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company roger kay an analyst at international data corporation observed that compaqs behavior at times seemed like a personal vendetta noting that eckhard has been so obsessed with staying ahead of dell that they focused too hard on market share and stopped paying attention to profitability and liquidity they got whacked in a price war that they started subsequent earnings releases from compaqs rivals dell gateway ibm and hewlettpackard suggested that the problems were not affecting the whole pc industry as pfeiffer had suggested dell and gateway sold direct which helped them to avoid compaqs inventory problems and compete on price without dealer markups plus gateway sold web access and a broad range of software tailored to small businesses hewlettpackards pc business had similar challenges like compaq but this was offset by hps extremely lucrative printer business while ibm sold pcs at a loss but used them to lock in multiyear services contracts with customers after pfeiffers resignation the board established an office of the ceo with a triumvirate of directors rosen as interim ceo and vice chairmen frank p doyle and robert ted enloe iii they began cleaning house as shortly afterward many of pfeiffers top executives resigned or were pushed out including john j rando earl l mason and john t rose rando senior vice president and general manager of compaq services was a key player during the merger discussions and the most senior executive from digital to remain with compaq after the acquisition closed and had been touted by some as the heirapparent to pfeiffer randos division had performed strongly as it had sales of  billion for the first quarter compared to  million in  which met expectations and was anticipated to post accelerated and profitable growth going forward at the time of randos departure compaq services ranked third behind those of ibm and eds while slightly ahead of hewlettpackards and andersen consulting however customers switched from digital and tandem technologybased workstations to those of hp ibm and sun microsystems mason senior vice president and chief financial officer had previously been offered the job of chief executive of alliant foodservice inc a foodservice distributor based in chicago and he informed compaqs board that he accepted the offer rose senior vice president and general manager of compaqs enterprise computing group resigned effective as of june  and was succeeded by tandem veteran enrico pesatori rose was reportedly upset that he was not considered for the ceo vacancy which became apparent once michael capellas was named coo while enterprise computing responsible for engineering and marketing of network servers workstations and datastorage products reportedly accounted for one third of compaqs revenues and likely the largest part of its profits it was responsible for the earnings shortfall in q of  in addition rose was part of the old guard close to former ceo pfeiffer and he and other compaq executives had been criticized at the companys annual meeting for selling stock before reporting the sales slowdown capellas was appointed coo after pressure mounted on rosen to find a permanent ceo however it was reported that potential candidates did not want to work under rosen as chairman pfeiffers permanent replacement was michael capellas who had been serving as compaqs svp and cio for under a year a couple months after pfeiffers ouster capellas was elevated to interim chief operating officer on june  and was soon appointed president and ceo capellas also assumed the title of chairman on september   when rosen stepped down from the board of directors at his retirement rosen proclaimed these are great achievements—to create  jobs  billion in sales and  billion in market value all starting with a sketch and a dream late s–sedit strugglesedit capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the pfeiffer era and he repaired the relationship with microsoft which had deteriorated under his predecessors tenure however compaq still struggled against lowercost competitors with direct sales channels such as dell who took over the top spot of pc manufacturer from compaq in  compaq relied significantly on reseller channels so their criticism caused compaq to retreat from its proposed direct sales plan although capellas maintained that he would use the middlemen to provide valueadded services despite falling to no  among pc manufacturers capellas proclaimed we are no  in the traditional pc market but were focused on industry leadership in the next generation of internet access devices and wireless mobility thats where the growth and the profitability will be the companys longerterm strategy involves extending its services to servers and storage products as well as handheld computers such as the ipaq pocketpc which accounted for  percent of total unit volume during november  compaq began to work with microsoft to create the first in a line of smallscale webbased computer systems called msn companions in  compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with navisite under the pact compaq agreed to promote and sell navisite web hosting services in return navisite took compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and intelbased servers compaq struggled as a result of the collapse of the dotcom bubble bust which hurt sales of their highend systems in  and  and they managed only a small profit in a few quarters during these years they also accumulated  billion in shortterm debt around this time the stock price of compaq which was around  when capellas became ceo was trading at half that by  acquisition by hewlettpackardedit in  compaq signed a merger agreement with hewlettpackard for  billion including  billion for goodwill where each compaq share would be exchanged for  of a hewlettpackard share there would be a termination fee of  million usd that either company would have to pay the other to break the merger compaq shareholders would own  of the combined company while hps would have  hewlettpackard had reported yearly revenues of  billion while compaqs was  billion and the combined company would have been close to ibms  billion revenues it was projected to have  billion in annual cost savings by mid the expected layoffs at compaq and hp  and  jobs respectively would leave the combined company with a workforce of  both companies had to seek approval from their shareholders through separate special meetings while compaq shareholders unanimously approved the deal there was a public proxy battle within hp as the deal was strongly opposed by numerous large hp shareholders including the sons of the company founders walter hewlett and david w packard as well as the california public employees’ retirement system calpers and the ontario teachers pension plan walter hewlett only reluctantly approved the merger in his duty as a member of the board of directors since the merger agreement called for unanimous board approval in order to ensure the best possible shareholder reception while supporters of the merger argued that there would be economies of scale and that the sales of pcs would drive sales of printers and cameras walter hewlett was convinced that pcs were a lowmargin but risky business that would not contribute and would likely dilute the old hps traditionally profitable imaging and printing division david w packard in his opposition to the deal cited massive layoffs as an example of this departure from hp’s core valuesarguing that although the founders never guaranteed job security bill and dave never developed a premeditated business strategy that treated hp employees as expendable packard further stated that fiorina’s highhanded management and her efforts to reinvent the company ran counter to the company’s core values as established by the founders the founders families who controlled a significant amount of hp shares were further irked because fiorina had made no attempt to reach out to them and consult about the merger instead they received the same standard roadshow presentation as other investors analysts on wall street were generally critical of the merger as both companies had been struggling before the announcement and the stock prices of both companies dropped in the months after the merger agreement was made public particularly rival dell made gains from defecting hp and compaq customers who were wary of the merger carly fiorina initially seen as hps savior when she was hired as ceo back in  had seen the companys stock price drop to less than half since she assumed the position and her job was said to be on shaky ground before the merger announcement hps offer was regarded by analysts to be overvaluing compaq due to compaqs shaky financial performance in the past recent years there were rumors that it could run out of money in  months and be forced to cease business operations had it stayed independent as well as compaqs own more conservative valuation of its assets detractors of the deal noted that buying compaq was a distraction that would not directly help hp take on ibms breadth or dell computers direct sales model plus there were significant cultural differences between hp and compaq which made decisions by consensus and rapid autocratic styles respectively one of compaqs few bright spots was its services business which was outperforming hps own services division the merger was approved by hp shareholders only after the narrowest of marginsclarification needed and allegations of vote buying primarily involving an alleged lastsecond backroom deal with deutsche bank haunted the new company it was subsequently disclosed that hp had retained deutsche banks investment banking division in january  to assist in the merger hp had agreed to pay deutsche bank  million guaranteed and another  million contingent upon approval of the merger on august   the us sec charged deutsche bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of  deutsche bank consented without admitting or denying the findings compaqs premerger ticker symbol was cpq this was combined with hewlettpackards ticker symbol hwp to create the current ticker symbol hpq postmergeredit former compaq headquarters now the hewlettpackard united states campus capellas compaqs last chairman and ceo became president of the postmerger hewlettpackard under chairman and ceo carly fiorina to ease the integration of the two companies however capellas was reported not to be happy with his role being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become ceo as the board supported fiorina capellas stepped down on november   just six months on the job to become ceo of mci worldcom where he would lead its acquisition by verizon capellas former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the ceo fiorina helmed hp for nearly three years after capellas left hp laid off thousands of former compaq dec hp and tandem employees its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up several senior executives from the compaq side including jeff clarke and peter blackmore would resign or be ousted from the postmerger hp though the combination of both companies pc manufacturing capacity initially made it the number one it soon lost the lead and further market share to dell which squeezed hp on low end pcs hp was also unable to compete effectively with ibm in the highend server market in addition the merging of the stagnant compaq computer assembly business with hps lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized for obstructing the profitability of the printingimaging segment overall it has been suggested that the purchase of compaq was not a good move for hp due to the narrow profit margins in the commoditized pc business especially in light of ibms  announcement to sell its pc division to lenovo the inquirer noted that the continued low return on investment and small margins of hps personal computer manufacturing business now named the personal systems group continues to be what it was in the individual companies not much more than a job creation scheme for its employees in february  the board of directors ousted fiorina former compaq ceo capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor but several months afterwards mark hurd was hired as president and ceo of hp hurd separated the pc division from the imaging and printing division and renamed it the personal systems group placing it under the leadership of evp todd r bradley hewlett packards pc business has since been reinvigorated by hurds restructuring and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers by late  hp had retaken the  sales position of pcs from dell which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality and held that rank until supplanted in the mids by lenovo most compaq products have been rebranded with the hp nameplate such as the companys market leading proliant server line now owned by hewlett packard enterprise which spun off from hp in  while the compaq brand was repurposed for some of hps consumeroriented and budget products notably compaq presario pcs hps business computers line was discontinued in favour of the compaq evo line which was rebranded hp compaq hps jornada pdas were replaced by compaq ipaq pdas which were renamed hp

placed on the new model compaq presarios in  hp reshuffled its business line notebooks the compaq name from its hp compaq series was originally used for all of hps business and budget notebooks however the hp elitebook line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the hp compaq b series became its middle business line as of early  the hp probook filled out hps low end business lineup in  hp sold part of compaqs former headquarters to the lone star college system on august   thenceo of hp leo apotheker announced plans for a partial or full spinoff of the personal systems group the pc unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for nearly a third of hp’s overall revenues in  hp was still selling more pcs than any other vendor shipping  million pcs in the second quarter of   of the market according to gartner while dell and lenovo were tied for second place each with more than a  share of the market and shipments of over  million units however the announcement of the pc spinoff concurrent with the discontinuation of webos and the purchase of autonomy corp for  billion was poorly received by the market and after apothekers ouster plans for a divestiture were cancelled in march  the printing and imaging division was merged into the pc unit in october  according to gartner lenovo took the lead as the number one pc manufacturer from hp while idc ranked lenovo just right behind hp in q  forbes reported that lenovo ranked ahead of hp as the world’s number one pc supplier the compaq brand name was discontinued in the united states in  in

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
