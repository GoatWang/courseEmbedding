nanalyze leave a comment tweet share share reddit  buffershares nanotechnology has great promise but also is prone to great hype oftentimes very futuristic applications are touted as viable for investors but are still many years away from commercialization smart glass however is one nanotechnology application that has already been commercialized and is beginning to ramp up for some tremendous growth according to a research report by marketsandmarkets the smart glass market was worth  billion in  and is expected to reach  billion by  a compound annual growth rate cagr of  from  to  one of the largest potential applications for smart glass is for use in commercial buildings with roughly  of all energy generated in the industrialized world being consumed by buildings it is not being used in a very efficient manner according to energy star the average commercial building wastes about  of its energy one startup view inc is looking to address this problem     about founded in  milpitas california based view inc has taken in just over  million in funding so far from investors such as khosla ventures ge capital and corning which also announced a strategic collaboration with view along with leading a  million investing round this is significant considering that corning has traditionally spent the majority of their rd budget inhouse and that they have a good eye for potential growth products such as “gorilla glass“ a product which went from zero to  billion in revenues in just  years dynamic glass view’s technology takes a nanoscale metal oxide film that is completely transparent and layers this on a normal window by then applying a tiny electrical charge the ions move between layers changing the structure and tinting the glass it’s not just dynamic glass that view sells it’s an entire system which is capable of tinting windows on demand via wall switches smart phones or via an intelligent algorithm that predicts the movement of the sun the entire window system for a commercial building can then be controlled and monitored from a single computer according to an article by forbes view’s dynamic glass will costs builders about  more per square foot than standard architectural glass however they can then install smaller heating and air conditioning systems this will result in up to a  reduction in hvac energy consumption and  reduction in peak load and also eliminates the need for window blinds according to an article by fortune ceo rao mulpuri estimates that view can capture  of the  billion square foot annual window glass market an estimated  billion opportunity view began largescale commercialization of their dynamic glass in  view’s glass is currently being used by organizations such as nasa the san francisco international airport the marine corps hilton hotels  resorts doubletree and the california energy commission among others in a future article we will take a look at a publicly traded smallcap company

is headquartered in milpitas california with highvolume manufacturing facilities in olive branch mississippi in  the company has changed its name to view in order to better align with its strategic vision that a clear uninterrupted view is the catalyst for a fundamental change in how people design and interact with buildings  view is based on technology developed at lawrence berkeley national laboratory and was founded in   nanodimension’s ceo aymeric sallin stated after announcing financial assistance to viewsoladigm that  “the soladigm team has demonstrated they can take a sophisticated nanotechnology from concept to industrial scale at a rapid pace while delivering on product performance durability and cost our interactions with award winning architectural institutions leading real estate developers and commercial builders reinforced our strong conviction in both the product and the company as a result has significantly increased its investment in this round of financing and i look forward to helping guide the company’s exciting future ” suppliers and buyers view dynamic glass is wellsuited for commercial buildings homes healthcare facilities educational institutions government facilities skylights and atria and hotels and restaurants the methodist olive branch hospital in olive branch mississippi recently had dynamic glass installed in their lobby  the architectural glass automatically transitions between clear and variable tint providing control over the amount of light and heat entering a building with view dynamic glass there is no need for window coverings curtains or shades  strategic partnerships  million of view’s financial backing was raised from venture capital firms khosla ventures and sigma partners  soladigm was also awarded a grant from the us department of energy for  million from the american recovery and reinvestment act   in  reinet investments and nanodimension provided soladgm with  million in series d equity

strategic development agreement to advance view’s dynamic glass technology  innovation and technology view makes glass for structures that provides higher efficiency and an ability to change lighting level  the glass uses an absorptive electrochromic technology based on tungstenoxide through a collaborative research and development agreement crada berkeley lab scientist andre anders worked with soladigm to characterize both the individual layers of the glass as well as the integrated device comprised of the combined layers in  soladigm also licensed a reflective electrochromic technology developed by berkeley lab scientist tom richardson which is expected to have higher performance and lower cost than firstgeneration dynamic windows  the firm claims that in a typical commercial

shows and industry conference events view inc a silicon valley technology company produces dynamic glass – a product and technology that is most impressive when you can walk into a building that has dynamic glass installed not only does it reduce glare and eliminate the need for blinds or shades it also protects occupants from the heat and glare of the sun this can be a hard sell on a showroom floor if you can not walk a customer through a real life demo that showcases your key selling points what a fantastic sales tool thanks so much to you and the teamwork making this happen i’ve visited century link and this is really just like being there fantastic” – mike lane region director – view inc virtual reality puts you inside the sales demo and lets you feel your surroundings for the greenbuild conference in la view inc worked with groove jones on creating a sales tool that not only transports their customers into a virtual showroom but it delivers dramatic d effects so they can feel how view dynamic glass reduces the heat this was accomplished by constructing a demo area on the trade show floor where customers could sit down or stand up at a desk and once inside the vr headset they are transported to an office setting located in new york or los angeles you get to choose your location this is vr the physical structure matches the vr environment so when you touch the actual desk in front of you it feels like you were in the cgi room controlling the sun weather and time of day customers are given a controller to change the weather conditions time of day and season outside the windows this gives the customer realtime control and feedback like nothing else put it in timelapse mode and your see the sun rise and set outside your window you see and feel the sun’s rays as it moves across the sky feeling the heat above the physical desk is a heat wall that powers up exactly where the sun’s position is in the vr world since view dynamic glass tints automatically in response to outdoor conditions reducing heat and glare the customer immediately feels the benefits of dynamic glass the response is immediate and powerful it truly positioned view as an innovative industry leader at the show but this didn’t surprise the view glass sales and marketing team this was actually the second time view has hired groove jones to help them initial case study proves a huge success six months ago view hired groove jones to create a vr tour of the century link building for the aia  conference the premier architecture and design event of the year put on by the american institute of architects the century link building incorporates  square feet of view dynamic glass making this facility the single largest installation of intelligent electrochromic glass in the country attendees of the conference experienced a º vr tour with similar d effects after the aia conference the demand for a portable vr demo that the sales team could take into the field was incredible so the team responded by outfitting every sales person with their own branded headset and vr kit regional offices were also outfitted with a heating wall demonstration kit feel free to
