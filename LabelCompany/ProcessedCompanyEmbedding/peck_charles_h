started his first collection on moss spending hours on identifying specimens afterwards he presented his collection to the state where it was seen by judge geo w clinton a descendant of one of new yorks most powerful and leading families clinton was also a botanist that got very impressed and interested in peck and his work on mosses because of his commitment to promote natural history education through the state natural history museum he was an important instrumental in securing pecks appointment in the state cabinet of natural history and became pecks encouragement to be a productive public official for science burnham  thanks to clinton in  dr peck was a volunteer in the state herbarium the herbarium contained the important collection of new york plants put together by john torrey during the nineteenth century which involved only plants until peck added fungi he got hired parttime at the museum in january   to complement the herbarium with plants of the state and by  peck was hired fulltime for  a year to build the cryptogrammic collections dr peck began his first mycological collection in the state herbarium after rev moses a curtis of north carolina motivated him this collection and study of it is what gives charles peck a worldwide name for all time in  he presented his resignation letter as state botanist but it is not until january   that it was accepted by the university of the state of new york dr peck retired from his job after fortyeight years of working at the state herbarium burnham  atkinson  affiliationsedit dr peck contributed with a

noteworthy member of the presbyterian church for over sixty years burnham  the man behind a geniusedit charles peck did not expose much of his personality on his publications or letters he was a private man a man that loved fruits and vegetables accustomed to physical training and therefore he was lean and fit pecks favorite outside work activities was climbing and walking the adirondack and catskill mountains he avoided cursing smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol and was an early riser in the politic area he was a republican but he would vote for the best candidate no matter what group the candidate belonged to his first vote was for john c fremont who won the elections against james buchanan in  in the religious area he was christian with strong religious convictions and believed in a simple and direct theory of the world being governed by one creator haines  mycological legacyedit charles horton peck contributed to the form and shape of american mycology even though he was a botanist and never a student or professor in the mycology subject he taught himself and reported his knowledge annually he was not the first american mycologist or the first to publish a report in this field but he was an important and central figure in america mycology because of his life and knowledge haines  after working fortyeight years peck left a legacy of  new species identified of fungi over  pages of publications and about  specimens his major interest was agaricaceae but he also described many species in other families from  to  he reported an index of  new species described
