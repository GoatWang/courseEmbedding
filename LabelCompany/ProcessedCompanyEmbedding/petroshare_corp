page  and our financial statements and notes thereto contained in this prospectus before making an investment decision this prospectus includes certain terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry which are defined in the glossary of oil and natural gas terms in appendix a beginning on page a business overview         we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties and have assembled approximately  net acres including mineral rights only acreage most of which is located in the denverjulesburg basin or the dj basin in northeast colorado our current operating focus is within the wattenberg field of the dj basin which is located primarily in adams and weld counties colorado we have concentrated our efforts in areas where we believe the geomechanical characteristics of the underlying formations offer the potential for greater returns on capital our evaluation metrics include reservoir thickness rock quality and resistivity of each formation each of which affect the number of wells we plan to drill per drilling spacing unit         we have placed particular emphasis on acquiring acreage in an area of the southern wattenberg field in adams county and southwest weld county colorado along with an area southeast of the field which areas we refer to collectively as the southern core where we have assembled approximately  net acres we selected our southern core acreage due to the quality of the hydrocarbon bearing rock the production performance from other nearby wells and the liquidsweighted nature of the production we believe that all of these factors make development of much of our southern core acreage economic in the prevailing commodity price environment we also have recently completed acquisitions in an area in the northern portion of the wattenberg field that previously has yielded hydrocarbon production from both vertical and horizontal wells         we have identified over  gross potential horizontal drilling locations which could result in over  net standardrange lateral wells approximately  lateral feet in areas of the wattenberg field that are prospective for oil and liquidsrich natural gas in the niobrara and codell formations however our strategy is to drill and participate in as many midrange approximately  lateral feet and extendedrange lateral approximately  lateral feet wells as feasible which could result in fewer net wells in our inventory industry results and our own technical analysis have suggested that mid and extendedrange lateral wells are the most efficient method to develop acreage in the wattenberg field ultimately the number of mid and extendedrange lateral wells we are able to drill or participate in will be determined by several factors including the nature and size of our interest in the acreage nearby development geology drilling spacing units permitting surface access and pad location over  of these locations are either permitted or in the process of being permitted and are comprised of standard mid and extendedrange lateral wells  table of contents         the following map illustrates the location of the southern core click to enlarge         our strategy is to continue to leverage our management teams extensive technical land financial and industry operating experience to direct the majority of our capital expenditure program through june   toward drilling operated niobrara and codell horizontal wells and acquire additional leaseholds in the dj basin which we believe will enhance our strategic value since entering the dj basin in  we have grown our position through acquisitions and organic leasing activities consistent with our track record we plan to continue to selectively and opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions in and around our core areas in adams and weld counties         we have an interest in  gross  net productive wells and  gross  net including  net minerals only acres of oil and gas properties with the exception of  gross  net horizontal wells in which we are participating as a nonoperator all of these wells are vertical wellbores over the first quarter of  we produced hydrocarbons at an average rate of approximately  boed at the end of april  our average production exceeded  boed or approximately three times the average first quarter rate at december   we had estimated proved developed reserves of  mboe and proved undeveloped reserves of  mboe with a standardized measure of approximately  million and a pv value of approximately  million based on sec pricing of  per bbl and  per mmbtu for an explanation of the pv value and a reconciliation to the standardized measure see summary historical reserve data  table of contents         the

core overview         we have subdivided our southern core focus area into the todd creek farms south brighton and runway prospects the southern core covers areas in the southern wattenberg field as well as outlying areas to the southeast of the field all of which is a part of the dj basin discovered in  and historically a gas field the wattenberg field now produces both crude oil and natural gas primarily from the niobrara and codell formations the dj basin generally extends from the denver metropolitan area throughout northeast colorado into parts of wyoming nebraska and kansas the majority of the wattenberg field lies in weld county but reaches into adams arapahoe boulder broomfield denver and larimer counties all in colorado         our primary targets in the southern core are the multiple benches in the niobrara formation including the a b and c benches and the codell formation the outlying portions of our southern core acreage including our runway prospect is prospective for the d and j sands         the niobrara formation is a calcareous chalk shale and limestone rock formation varying from approximately  to  feet in thickness and extending from canada to new mexico but the vast majority of the oil and natural gas concentration is in colorado and wyoming the formation generally slopes downward from east to west from kansas to western colorado from hydrocarbon producing depths of approximately  feet to  feet below the surface the codell formation is an oil and natural gas producing tight sandstone formation generally found at depths of approximately  to  feet below the surface and located at the base of the niobrarafort hays limestone member         the d and j sands are present throughout the wattenberg field and contain hydrocarbons at depths ranging from  feet to  feet in the center of the dj basin the d sand is generally economically productive for both oil and gas in vertical wells when such wells encounter higher quality sandstones the j sand is the principal formation in the wattenberg field and produces gas and associated condensate from tight sand reservoirs we have access to d seismic data in the area of our runway prospect which may help us determine the best way to ultimately develop our acreage         the southern core covers areas in adams county and southwest weld county the southern core area saw significant development through vertical drilling in the preceding decades but modern horizontal drilling is relatively new for the area the northern core wattenberg located south of greeley colorado in westcentral weld county has been the primary focus of oil and gas producers for the past seven years however activity in the southern core has picked up significantly over the past two years and according to the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc records active operators in the southern core including pdc energy inc pdc great western oil  gas co great western ward petroleum co ward and kerrmcgee corporation  table of contents kerrmcgee are increasing their permitting spacing and drilling programs we believe the southern core provides us compelling economics in the current price environment         we currently possess a total inventory of over  gross potential horizontal drilling locations up to  net wells on our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects in the southern core including  locations that are fully permitted or in the final permitting stages this horizontal well inventory assumes  to  wells per acre drilling spacing unit with multizone potential in the codell and niobrara a b and c formations this multizone potential has been successfully tested by other operators and we are currently participating as a nonoperator in active development programs with three different established area operators our participation is comprised of multiple horizontal wells targeting the codell and all three benches of the niobrara formation         through the period ending june   we plan on spending  million on development of our properties lease acquisitions and working capital our plan is to drill approximately  gross  net operated wells and participate in an additional  gross  net nonoperated wells in the southern core we plan to fund these activities using the net proceeds from this offering cash on hand cash flow generated from operations including our nonoperated wells and additional equity or debt financings as necessary southern core todd creek farms         within the southern core our primary prospect is todd creek farms which is located in northwest adams county colorado we have assembled a  gross  net acre position in todd creek farms through our geologic analysis as well as the results from wells in which we have participated as a nonoperator we identified the todd creek farms prospect as being highly prospective for multibench horizontal well development in the niobrara a b c and codell formations todd creek farmsoperated activity         we have obtained permits for  operated wells on our todd creek farms acreage after setting surface casing in april  we began horizontal lateral drilling operations of all  shook pad wells in may  on which we have permitted  codell wells and  wells targeting all three benches of the niobrara our working interest in the shook pad wells averages approximately  our second operated pad is expected to be the corcillius pad on which we have permitted  wells targeting the codell and niobrara formations however we do not expect to begin any drilling operations on the corcillius pad until early          under our operated capital plan through june   we plan to drill and complete  gross  net operated horizontal wells on our shook pad and  gross  net operated horizontal wells on our corcillius pad for a total capital expenditure of approximately  million todd creek farmsnonoperated activity         during  and the first quarter of  we participated in the drilling and completion of  gross  net horizontal wells in todd creek farms all of these wells are operated by companies with an established track record in the wattenberg field including pdc great western and ward in addition to the aforementioned wells we have been informed that great western and ward plan to collectively drill up to  additional gross wells on pads in todd creek farms over the next  to  months while as a nonoperator we are unable to control whether and when these additional wells will be drilled and completed we have allocated a total capital cost of  million for an additional  wells net to our interest  table of contents         the pdc jacobucci pad where we have working interests ranging from  to  is currently on production and flowing back into the sales pipeline the jacobucci pad is comprised of  midrange horizontal wells including  codell wells  niobrara b wells and  niobrara c wells in the same area we participated in  extendedrange lateral wells that are operated by great western on its marcus pad targeting the two separate benches in the niobrara with an approximately  working interest in each well the marcus pad wells had day average daily production rates of  and  gross boed per well respectively we also participated in one standardrange lateral codell well with an approximately  working interest operated by ward on its riverdale pad which had a day average daily production rate of  gross boed southern core south brighton         our south brighton prospect is east of our todd creek farms prospect and sits in northern adams county and southern weld county colorado we acquired the majority of this acreage in our transaction with crimson exploration operating inc crimson during  we have leaseholds encompassing  gross  net acres in south brighton we believe south brighton is prospective for multibench horizontal well development in the niobrara and codell formations south brightonoperated activity         we anticipate that our first operated drilling program at south brighton will be the brighton lakes pad on which we have an application pending for  extendedrange lateral wells we expect the pad to consist of up to  codell wells and  niobrara wells our working interest in the proposed brighton lakes pad wells averages approximately  we expect to begin drilling operations on the brighton lakes pad by the first quarter of  under our operated capital plan through june   we plan to drill and complete  gross  net operated horizontal wells on our brighton lakes pad for a total capital expenditure of  million south brightonnonoperated activity         we have not participated in any nonoperated wells in south brighton however industry activity has picked up and we expect to receive notice to participate in wells from operators on our acreage over the next  months each of great western edge petroleum corp edge petroleum ward and hrm resources has acreage offsetting our south brighton acreage edge petroleum has permitted  standardrange lateral wells in south brighton in which we have a  working interest however edge petroleum has not submitted an authorization for expenditure on these wells and they may or may not be drilled by june   southern core runway         our runway prospect is east of our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects and lies within adams county colorado east of the denver international airport with the closing of the morning gun acquisition on april   as discussed further below we now have leaseholds encompassing  gross  net acres in the runway prospect most of this acreage is held by production from vertical wells giving us control of the pace of the development of this area nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be prospective for d and j sands and able to be developed using both vertical and horizontal wells         a number of public and private company operators are developing acreage near our position and we plan to monitor these operators results we believe this area to have extensive hydrocarbon saturation in tight sand reservoirs at this time we do not plan on allocating any capital to this area over the next  months however we will monitor nearby activity and may increase allocated capital to our runway prospect if we feel the riskadjusted returns on capital meet internal return targets  table of contents   other properties northern wattenberg field         in addition to our southern core acreage we also have assembled  gross  net acres in the northern area of the wattenberg field a preliminary evaluation indicates that there are  potential gross horizontal drilling locations which could result in up to  net wells on this acreage based on  wells per each acre drilling spacing unit we are the operator on the majority of this acreage giving us control of the pace of the development of this area nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be prospective for multiple benches and zones including both the niobrara and codell formations a number of operators including noble energy inc extraction oil  gas inc and synergy resources corporation dba src energy inc are actively developing acreage in the northern wattenberg field at this time we plan on directing little to no drilling and completion capital to this area over the next  months however we will monitor nearby activity from these other operators and may increase allocated capital to this area if we feel the riskadjusted returns on capital meet internal return targets buck peak         in  we drilled and completed our initial twowell program at our buck peak prospect in northwest colorado targeting the niobrara formation those two wells resulted in nominal production and accordingly we are not actively pursuing development in this area we will however monitor activity in the area and continue to evaluate additional opportunities for our  gross  net acres capital plan through june           we plan to use the net proceeds from this offering along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations including from our nonoperated wells and equity and debt financings as necessary to embark on an aggressive drilling program to convert our undeveloped leasehold position to production cash flow and reserves through june   we plan to spend approximately  million to drill  net operated horizontal wells and approximately  million to participate in the drilling of  net nonoperated wells in the southern core we also have budgeted approximately  million for additional completion costs relating to the recently completed  gross  net jacobucci pad wells in which we are participating as a nonoperator and  million for additional leasehold acquisitions and working

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ business strategies         our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by increasing reserves production and revenue at attractive rates of return on invested capital we are focused on exploiting longlived unconventional oil ngl and natural gas reserves from the wattenberg field we plan to accomplish our objectives through the execution of the following strategies  balanced operated and nonoperated capital program   our management team elected initially to develop our properties in the southern core by participating in nonoperated pads with established operators such as pdc ward and great western the individuals on our management team have extensive experience operating in the dj basin which combined with knowledge gained from our recent nonoperated well participation and observing offset operator activity gives us a strong understanding of the underlying formations and optimal drilling and completion techniques in our area based on this information and the continued derisking and delineation of our position by nearby operators we commenced our operated drilling activities on our shook pad in april  we expect operational control of our properties will enable us to capture operating efficiencies and allow us to control the pace of development and capital outlay  aggressively develop our southern core acreage   we intend to aggressively and selectively drill and develop our southern core acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential on our remaining undeveloped acreage we believe that we can drill between  and  horizontal wells per drilling spacing unit depending on the geologic and economic viability of the various  table of contents niobrara and codell targets utilizing these assumptions we have identified potential drilling locations that could result in up to  net wells in our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects we plan to drill  net operated and participate in  net nonoperated wells through june    pursue strategic acquisitions and increase our leasehold in the wattenberg field   we intend to continue to leverage our management teams extensive relationships to opportunistically increase our acreage holdings at attractive valuations we also intend to pursue organic leasing opportunities corporate mergers or asset acquisitions and farmin related opportunities we have a successful track record of closing oil and natural gas asset acquisitions including the recent acquisitions of well interests and net acres from pdc crimson and morning gun exploration llc morning gun since entering the dj basin without any acreage in  we have rapidly grown our footprint to approximately  net acres see recent developments on page  for more detail on our acquisitions our competitive strengths         we believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on current conditions in the oil and natural gas industry as a result of the following competitive strengths  multiyear drilling inventory in the todd creek farms and south brighton prospects targeting the niobrara and codell formations   we believe nearby operator horizontal drilling activity and well results in and around our acreage have significantly mitigated the geologic risk in our drilling program our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects are located in an area where drilling results and the liquidsweighted nature of the assets allow for generating accretive returns even in a low commodity price environment we have identified over  gross horizontal drilling locations up to  net wells on our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects as of december   a majority of these locations have been designated proved undeveloped reserves by our thirdparty reserve engineer we believe we can identify and develop additional locations in these prospects we believe our multiyear drilling portfolio provides the potential for nearterm growth in our production and reserves and highlights the longterm resource potential across our asset base  experienced and aligned management team with proven financial technical and operational expertise   our chief executive officer stephen foley has over  years of experience as a real estate developer in colorado with an extensive background in surface development in the areas in which we have acquired acreage our president frederick witsell and chief operating officer william lloyd bring a long history in colorado and depth of experience in the industry to our company mr witsell has over  years of experience in several facets of the oil and gas industry including prospect development conventional and horizontal drilling and completion operations project management gathering and compression systems and marketing and risk management mr lloyd also has over  years of experience in the industry serving in engineering management and senior leadership capacities prior to this offering our directors executive officers and employees owned including all options and warrants approximately  of our company which provides a meaningful incentive to increase the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders  our strategic partnerships   in may  we entered into a participation agreement the participation agreement with providence energy operators llc providence we believe our relationship with providence is instrumental to our success in addition to helping to fund our acquisition and development strategy through a  million line of credit we established with providence in may  the initial line of credit the relationship provides us access to providences industry expertise we believe our relationship with providence is strong as  table of contents evidenced by its participation in all of our southern core acquisitions our borrowing arrangement and providences holdings in our common stock the relationship with providence and its affiliates has led to the acquisition of much of the acreage that we currently hold in addition to our providence relationship our executive officers have developed relationships and formalized agreements with business partners that have and we believe will continue to contribute significantly to our growth through a services agreement executed in  with kingdom resources llc kingdom we have gained access to a portfolio of oil and gas leases in an attractive portion of the wattenberg field our relationship with kingdom has also provided surface access for drilling operations and water for drilling and production operations on our leasehold interests  liquidsweighted reserves   our net proved reserves at december   were comprised of approximately  oil and ngls collectively liquids given the current commodity price environment and resulting disparity between oil and natural gas prices on a boe basis we believe our high percentage of liquid reserves and drilling program focused on oilweighted projects compared to our overall reserve base is a key strength  meaningful growth opportunities   our relative footprint and size provides us the ability to significantly increase our scale by piecing together acreage blocks that may be considered less attractive to larger operators within our focus area these blocks have meaningful impact on our position as evidenced by the recent pdc crimson and morning gun asset acquisitions and we expect to continue our track record of making these types of acquisitions as we grow our position see recent developments below for more detail on our acquisitions recent developments         during  and early  we took important steps to improve our business by making several lease acquisitions participating as a nonoperator in the drilling of  gross  net horizontal wells in the wattenberg field and completing the permitting process of our first planned operated wells in the southern core our leasing activities have been focused on areas in adams county and southwest weld county colorado in the southern core supplemental line of credit         on october   we entered into a revolving line of credit facility the supplemental line of credit with providence energy partners iii lp pep iii the supplemental line of credit permitted us to borrow up to  million to pay costs associated with our acquisition and development of oil and gas properties we have used draws on the supplemental line of credit to pay for certain of our acquisitions including the crimson acquisition discussed below as well as to pay costs associated with our operated and nonoperated drilling programs         as required by an amendment to the supplemental line of credit we repaid approximately  million in outstanding principal on april   and agreed not to borrow additional funds in exchange for pep iii extending the maturity date of the supplemental line of credit we have approximately  million plus accrued interest of approximately  outstanding against the supplemental line of credit all of which is due on june   pdc assets acquisition         on june   we completed the acquisition of oil and gas assets or the pdc assets from pdc the pdc assets include leases covering approximately  gross  net acres located in adams county colorado and pdcs interest in  gross  net productive wells and  horizontal well locations that are permitted providence exercised its option pursuant to the participation agreement and acquired  of the pdc assets much of the acreage we acquired from pdc is within  table of contents our todd creek farms prospect and held by production while

measure amounts associated with the estimated proved reserves attributable to our properties as of december   we did not have material reserves as of december   to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows our independent reserve engineer cawley gillespie  associates inc cawley gillespie considered many factors and assumptions including the use of

average oil and gas prices during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first day of the month

comparable gaap financial measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes on estimated future net revenues neither pv value nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties we and others in the industry use pv value as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities the following table presents a  table of contents reconciliation of pv value to the gaap financial measure of standardized measure as of the date

natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured exactly the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment accordingly reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered         future prices realized for production and costs may vary perhaps significantly from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates the standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil ngls and natural gas reserves the  discount factor used to calculate standardized measure which is required by financial accounting standards board pronouncements is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate the present value no matter what discount rate is used is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production which may prove to be inaccurate  table of contents risk factors          an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this prospectus before making an investment decision if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operation could materially suffer in that case you may lose all or part of your investment if we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from occurring then our business may suffer risks relating to our company since we are a new business with a limited operating history investors have no basis to evaluate our ability to operate profitability         we were incorporated in september  and our activities to date have been limited to organizational efforts raising capital developing our business plan assembling an initial lease inventory participating as a nonoperator in several drilling programs and limited drilling efforts we face all of the risks commonly encountered by other new businesses including the lack of an established operating history need for additional capital and personnel and competition our business may not be successful or we may never operate profitably we may not be able to effectively manage the demands required of a new business in our industry such that we may be unable to successfully implement our business plan or achieve profitability as described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern         as described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this uncertainty is based on our substantial nearterm liabilities limited revenue and negative working capital among other things which existed as of march   we are dependent on obtaining funding from operations and the sale of debt or equity to continue as a going concern our plan of operations as set forth in this prospectus is subject to our obtaining adequate working capital of which there can be no assurance         at march   we had a cash balance of approximately  million and other current assets of approximately  million subsequent to march   our cash balance has decreased significantly as we have paid certain acquisition and development costs including costs previously accrued and general and administrative expenses in june  we are obligated to repay approximately  million in principal and approximately  in accrued interest to satisfy the terms of our supplemental line of credit an approximately  accrued interest payment on our initial line of credit and an approximately  accrued interest payment on our outstanding convertible promissory notes we also will incur additional expenses related to our recently commenced operated drilling program on our shook pad during the second and third quarters of this year we had net losses of approximately  million during the three months ended march   and  million during the year ended december           our ability to continue as a going concern depends on the success of our current drilling efforts future exploration and development efforts and our ability to generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs and expenses in the event we are unable to obtain adequate funding from our ongoing drilling efforts both operated and nonoperated and through the sale of debt or equity securities we may have to delay reduce or eliminate certain of our planned operations reduce overall overhead expense or divest assets this in turn may have an adverse effect on our ability to realize the value of our assets if we are unable to continue as a going concern you may lose all or part of your investment  table of contents we are dependent on additional financing to repay our obligations and fund the continued development and implementation of our business plan and our failure to obtain this capital may cause the partial or total loss of your investment         we do not anticipate that our cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to pay all of our obligations and capital requirements and accordingly we anticipate that additional financing will be required significant amounts of capital are required for companies to participate in the business of exploration for and development of oil and natural gas resources we also require capital to acquire additional acreage as well as repay our debt and pay our administrative expenses including salary and rent adverse developments in our business or general economic conditions may require us to raise additional financing at prices or on terms that are disadvantageous to existing shareholders we may not be able to obtain additional capital at all and may be forced to curtail or cease our operations we will continue to rely on equity or debt financing and the sale of working interests to finance operations until such time if ever that we generate sufficient cash flow the inability to obtain necessary financing may adversely impact our ability to develop our properties force us to curtail our business plan and result in a default under our debt obligations our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and any default by us may cause us to forfeit all or a portion of our properties         we have fullydrawn our lines of credit and we have outstanding debt of approximately  million plus accrued interest of the total debt outstanding approximately  million is secured by liens on our property if we are unable to repay any of this debt on a timely basis we may be forced to forfeit all or a portion of our properties our ability to repay our lines of credit is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient revenue from operations or obtain cash from other sources if we are unable to repay the short term indebtedness or otherwise default under either of our lines of credit or our other indebtedness the lender may foreclose on our assets         we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the longterm risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if our debt cannot be paid refinanced or extended we may be required to divest our assets or file for bankruptcy further if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation and development of our assets and properties         the agreements governing our lines of credit require us to comply with certain financial and operating covenants so long as the loans are outstanding these covenants generally prohibit us without the lenders consent from among other things incurring additional indebtedness or making loans to any third party other than trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of business and selling leasing or otherwise disposing of any material assets in excess of  in any calendar year our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors and could be impacted by current or future economic conditions failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default which if we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders could accelerate our repayment obligations under the lines of credit and thereby have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and ability to remain in business we have historically incurred losses and may not achieve profitability in the future         we have incurred losses from operations during our history in the oil and natural gas business we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  million as of march   our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on successfully addressing our nearterm capital needs and  table of contents implementing our acquisition development and production activities all of which are subject to many risks beyond our control even if we become profitable on an annual basis our profitability may not be sustainable or increase on a periodic basis our estimates of oil and gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves and our financial condition         there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves including factors beyond our reserve engineers control reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves or of cash flows attributable to such reserves is a function of the available data assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices expenditures for future development and exploration activities engineering and geological interpretations and judgment in addition accurately estimating reserves in shale formations such as the niobrara and codell formations can be even more difficult than estimating reserves in more traditional hydrocarbonbearing formations given the complexities of the projected decline curves and economics of shale wells additionally probable and possible reserve estimates are estimates of unproved reserves and may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not experts in the oil or natural gas industry         as such investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history development and exploration activities and prices of oil and gas in addition different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data due to our smaller volume of reserves compared to our competitors revisions in reserve estimate and future cash flows have a greater chance of being material to us our dj basin assets may be less valuable to us than expected         we have made several oil and gas acquisitions in the dj basin since january   including the pdc crimson and morning gun assets much of the acreage we acquired in  and early  is within the southern core the value of our assets is based in large part on our ability to develop the properties and increase proven and probable reserves this in turn requires us to make accurate estimates of our capital needs to implement and continue a development program for those properties to obtain that capital and to successfully drill the wells we may not be able to obtain the capital necessary to develop these properties or our development efforts may not be successful if we are unable to obtain the necessary capital or successfully develop these properties the price of our stock may decline and you may lose some or all of your investment we have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate         we are not or will not be the operator on some of our properties and as a result our ability to exercise influence over the operations of these properties or their associated costs is limited our dependence on the operators and other working interest owners of these projects and any future projects our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs or control the risks and our access to required capital could materially and adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors including  timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operators expertise and financial resources  the rate of production of reserves if any  table of contents  approval of other participants in drilling wells and  selection of technology         as a result our ability to exercise influence over the operations of some of our current or future properties is and may be limited the due diligence undertaken in connection with the acquisition of our oil and gas properties may not have revealed all relevant considerations or liabilities related to those assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations         we have completed several significant asset acquisitions to date including the pdc crimson and morning gun assets through which we have acquired oil and gas properties and surface rights and easements the due diligence undertaken by us in connection with these acquisitions may not have revealed all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisitions the information provided to us in connection with our diligence may have been incomplete or inaccurate as part of that process we have also made subjective judgments regarding the results of operations and prospects of the assets we have acquired if the due diligence investigation has failed to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may be present such as title defects or environmental problems we may incur substantial impairment charges or other losses in the future in addition we may be subject to significant previously undisclosed liabilities that were not identified during the due diligence process and which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations the historical and unaudited pro forma financial information reflecting the pdc and crimson assets included in this prospectus may not be representative of our actual results in the future and accordingly you have only limited financial information on which to evaluate our company and your investment decision         the historical financial information of the pdc assets included in this prospectus represents the operation of those assets for the two years ended december   and  and the six month period ended june   the historical financial information of the crimson assets included in this prospectus represents the operation of those assets for the two years ended december   and  and the nine month period ended september   the unaudited pro forma information reflecting the combined operating results of our company and the pdc and crimson assets as if the acquisitions had been completed january   are presented for informational and illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have actually occurred had the acquisition of the pdc and crimson assets been completed as of that date nor is it indicative of our future operating results the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect future nonrecurring charges resulting from the acquisition or future events that may occur including any restructuring activities and does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues expense efficiencies or asset dispositions the unaudited pro forma financial information is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the pdc and crimson assets that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances however our assumptions may not prove to be accurate over time as a result investors should not place undue reliance on the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this prospectus we have granted providence the option to participate in certain of our acreage acquisitions which has reduced our ownership of the majority of our assets and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations         on may   we entered into the participation agreement with providence under the terms of the participation agreement we assigned an undivided  interest to our right title and interest in and to our then existing leases in our todd creek farms prospect providence agreed to pay its pro rata share of lease acquisition expenses and the expenses necessary to maintain the leases in full force  table of contents and effect in addition the participation agreement designates an area of mutual interest or ami pursuant to which if either party acquires any lease in the ami territory on or before may   then the nonacquiring party shall have the right to acquire its proportionate  interest in and to such ami leases the ami covers an area in adams county colorado containing all of township  south range  west consisting of approximately  gross acres with an additional onemile border around the defined ami area plus any other mutually agreeable areas to date providence has exercised its option to participate or otherwise has participated in all of our acreage acquisitions in the dj basin including our recent pdc crimson and morning gun acquisitions         so long as the participation agreement remains in full force and effect any future acquisition of ami leases will require us upon providences exercise of its option to assign a  interest in and to the ami leases as a result we may never whollyown such ami leases and any earnings we may achieve as a result of such acquisition will have to be shared proportionally with providence such division of earnings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we have limited management and staff and will be dependent upon partnering arrangements and thirdparty service providers         we currently have ten employees including our chief executive officer president and chief operating officer our chief financial officer serves in his role as an independent contractor we also leverage the services of other independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services including engineering oil and gas well planning and supervision and land legal environmental and tax services we also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation evaluation and prospect leasing our dependence on thirdparty consultants and service providers creates a number of risks including but not limited to  the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed and  the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects         if we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or they perform poorly our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have resources that are substantially greater than ours         our industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil natural gas and ngls but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition larger companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low commodity prices larger competitors may also be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which could adversely affect our competitive position these factors could adversely affect the success of our operations and our profitability  table of contents our substantial investment in a limited number of prospects and lack of geographic diversification increases the risk to investors that we may not be profitable         our investment in the dj basin and the capital required to pay our share of drilling and production costs for development of our properties increases the risk that the operation of our business may not be profitable as we will not be able to spread the risk of investment and operation over a number of different assets until we become profitable or receive additional investment         our operations are currently concentrated in colorado an area that experiences severe weather events including tornadoes flooding and storms our information systems and administrative and management processes could be disrupted if a catastrophic event such as a tornado power outage or act of terror destroyed or severely damaged our facilities any such catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business in addition operating in a concentrated area increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform for example we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting colorado natural disasters in the geographic area competition for equipment services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets although moffatt adams and weld counties in colorado have wellestablished oilfield infrastructures we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from our wells therein caused by transportation capacity constraints curtailment of production availability of equipment facilities personnel or services significant governmental regulation natural disasters adverse weather conditions plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas such as the dj basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects are not commercially productive of oil or natural gas any funds spent on exploration and production may be lost         a significant portion of our current capital investment is tied up in our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects if these properties are not economic all of the funds that we have invested or will invest in the future will be lost our planned drilling programs in these prospects involve multiple horizontal wells which are expensive to drill our business plan is dependent on among other things developing sufficient reserves to generate cash flow and provide a return on investment if we are not successful in producing economically viable amounts of oil andor gas from our properties our business may suffer and you may lose all or part of your investment in addition the failure to produce commercially may make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds in the form of additional sale of our equity securities or working interests in other property in which we may acquire an interest we may have difficulty managing our growth and our results of operation may suffer as a result         we have amassed a large number of leases are beginning our second drilling program are participating in several nonoperated drilling programs and have added a number of producing wells to our inventory since the beginning of  compared to our interest in  as a result we may have difficulty managing those assets as we continue to grow our company the integration of operations from the pdc assets and the crimson assets and management of our nonoperated properties will require the dedication of significant management resources which may temporarily distract their attention from the daytoday business of our company the process of integrating those assets with our  table of contents existing assets may cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our business and could have an adverse effect on our operating results for an indeterminate period of time we may also need to hire and train additional personnel to help manage our assets which will require additional financial resources and management attention the failure to successfully integrate any such acquisitions or participation to identify and retain key personnel and to successfully manage the challenges presented by the integration process may adversely affect our business our ability to sell any production andor receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected by a lack of transportation capacity constraints and interruptions         the marketability of any production from any of our properties depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of thirdparty refineries oil and natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities we expect to deliver much of the oil and natural gas produced from our properties through trucking services and pipelines that we do not own the availability of delivery capacity in these pipelines is in part dependent on the market price for oil and natural gas as higher prices will attract additional production which in turn will take up capacity in these systems the lack of availability or capacity of these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for any production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties our business is substantially dependent on our senior executive officers and the loss of service of any of these individuals would adversely affect our business         stephen foley is our chief executive officer and is responsible for overseeing our business developing our business plan and the strategic vision of our company frederick witsell is our president and is responsible for identifying and valuing acquisition opportunities as well as managing our integrated business operations paul maniscalco is our chief financial officer and is responsible for the oversight of our daytoday accounting operations as well as our periodic financial reporting william lloyd is our chief operating officer and is responsible for the management of engineering and operating activities including coordination of permitting drilling and completion activities each of these individuals is critical to the perceived success of our business the loss of service of any of these individuals would adversely affect our business as we have very limited personnel and expect to rely on contractors for a majority of services that we require we may not be able to replace any of such individuals or if so on terms that were acceptable to our company we have no key man life insurance on any of these individuals we are an emerging growth company and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies our common stock may be less attractive to investors         as an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to the following  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and  exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and from holding a vote for stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved         investors could find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile  table of contents our financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies         we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election if the public company accounting oversight board adopts new or revised accounting standards and we decide to delay adoption of such changes our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected we are not required to obtain an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under section b of the sarbanesoxley act of  until we are no longer an emerging growth company         for so long as we remain an emerging growth company we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to obtain the auditor attestation of our assessment of our internal controls once we are no longer an emerging growth company or if prior to such date we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of  the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed  billion subject to adjustment for inflation  the last day of the fiscal year during which occurs the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering  the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt or  the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer under the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act once we are no longer an emerging growth company compliance with section b will be costly we will incur significantly increased costs as a result of and devote substantial management time to operating as a newlylisted company on the nyse mkt         if we are approved for listing on the nyse mkt we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur before when trading on the otcqb marketplace for example we will be subject to the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the nyse mkt including changes in corporate governance practices we will also be required to register our common stock under the exchange act which will among other things require us to comply with the proxy solicitation rules these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will render some activities more timeconsuming and costly in addition our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these listing requirements if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decline         as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control further we are required to report any changes in internal controls on a quarterly basis in addition we are required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual  table of contents report on form k following the date on which we are no longer an emerging growth company if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section  in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when required investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of the common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which the securities are listed the us securities and exchange commission or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources colorado law and our articles of incorporation may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits at the expense of the shareholders         the laws of the state of colorado provide that directors of a corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for all but limited types of conduct our articles of incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law the exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances risks relating to the energy production andor distribution industry oil and natural gas exploration and development are affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and low prices could have a material adverse effect on the future of our business         if development efforts are successful in identifying economic amounts of oil and natural gas our future success will depend largely on the prices received for any oil or natural gas production prices received also will affect the amount of future cash flow available for capital expenditures and may affect the ability to raise additional capital lower prices affect the amount of oil and natural gas that can be commercially produced from reserves either discovered or acquired and may also make it uneconomical to drill in certain areas         the prices for oil and natural gas have seen a steep decline since  and may fluctuate widely in the future the price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil as quoted on nymex has ranged from a high of  per barrel to a low of  per barrel in the twelve months ended may   and the price of henry hub natural gas as quoted on nymex has ranged from a high of  per mmbtu to a low of  per mmbtu for the same period on may   the price of wti was  per barrel and henry hub natural gas was  per mmbtu         factors that can cause price fluctuations include  the level of consumer product demand  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  consumer perception and the availability of alternative energy sources  refinery capacity  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  actions by other producers including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec  political and ethnic conflicts in oil and natural gas producing regions  table of contents  the price of foreign imports and  overall economic conditions we may incur significant expenses relating to the inspection and possible abandonment of certain conduits for natural gas oil condensate or other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons         on april   a house in weld county colorado experienced an explosion and fire the cause of which was determined to be natural gas that seeped into the house from a severed flowline from a nearby vertical wellbore owned and operated by an unrelated third party in response on may   the cogcc issued a notice to operators nto requiring all oil and gas operators in colorado to systematically inspect their inventory of pipelines and conduits for natural gas oil condensate or other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons flowlines to verify that any pipeline or flowline not in active use is properly abandoned pursuant to cogcc rules by may   we are required to inspect all pipelines and flowlines that are located within  feet of certain buildings and provide to the cogcc certain information relating to the well tank batteries and flowlines in addition we are required to inspect all abandoned pipelines and flowlines without regard to their distance from any building to verify such pipelines and flowlines were properly abandoned in accordance with cogcc rules by june   we are required to pressure test all flowlines within  feet of certain building units and ensure and document that these lines have integrity we also are required to abandon all pipelines and flowlines regardless of distance from buildings not in active use not later than june   we may incur significant expenses in complying with the nto including expenses to hire independent contractors to inspect and test our pipelines and flowlines and if required to abandon any pipeline or flowline in accordance with cogcc rules the cost of oil and natural gas exploration is extremely volatile and may adversely affect our operations         the costs of oil and natural gas exploration such as the costs of drilling rigs casing cement and pumps and the fuel and parts necessary to keep the rigs and pumps operating and the costs of the oil field service crews have been volatile over the past few years in direct proportion to the amount of ongoing oil and natural gas exploration as with most other companies involved in resource exploration and development we may be adversely affected by future increases in the costs of conducting exploration development and resource extraction that may not be fully offset by increases in the price received on sales of oil or natural gas if crude oil and natural gas prices decrease we may be required to writedown the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties         we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans production data economics and other factors we may be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties a writedown constitutes a noncash charge to earnings we may incur impairment charges in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital we identified locations scheduled to be drilled over several years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling         our management team has identified drilling locations in our operating areas scheduled over a multiyear period our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors including the availability of equipment and capital approval by regulators seasonal conditions oil and natural gas prices assessment of risks costs and drilling results the final determination on whether to  table of contents drill any of these locations will be dependent upon the factors described elsewhere in this prospectus as well as to some degree the results of our drilling activities with respect to our established drilling locations due to these uncertainties we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or at all our actual drilling activities may be materially different from our current expectations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations financial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers third party operators or other third parties could decrease cash flow from operations and adversely affect exploration and development activities         we expect to derive essentially all our revenue from the sale of our oil and natural gas to unaffiliated third party purchasers including independent marketing companies and midstream companies any delays in payments from such purchasers caused by financial problems encountered by them would have an immediate negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows liquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our working interest coowners or the third party operators of our nonoperated properties may prevent or delay the drilling of a well or the development of a project our working interest coowners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due in the case of a working interest owner we could be required to pay the working interest owners share of the project costs we may not be able to obtain the capital necessary to fund these contingencies we may face difficulties in securing and operating under authorizations and permits to drill complete or operate our wells         the recent growth in oil and gas exploration in the united states has drawn intense scrutiny from environmental and community interest groups regulatory agencies and other governmental entities as a result we may face significant opposition to or increased regulation of our operations that may make it difficult or impossible to obtain permits and other needed authorizations to drill complete or operate result in operational delays or otherwise make oil and gas exploration more costly or difficult than in other countries the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute exploration and development plans within the established budget and on a timely basis         shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves or puds may take longer than expected and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate therefore our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced         at december   approximately  of our total estimated proved reserve volumes were classified as proved undeveloped reserves recovery of undeveloped reserves requires successful drilling and incurrence of significant capital expenditures our approximately  mboe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated  million of development capital over the next five years development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the pv value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may  table of contents result in some projects becoming uneconomic in addition delays in the development of reserves could require us to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves         further our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and that these operations will be conducted successfully these assumptions however may not prove correct if we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves we may be required to reduce our reserves any such reduction of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow and adversely affect our liquidity and available capital if we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices we may be subject to significant reductions in price alternatively we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our profitability         we may use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines their use also may limit future revenues from price increases hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations alternatively in the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability derivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge crude oil and natural gas prices and increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability         in july  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act was enacted into law the doddfrank act regulates derivative transactions including commodity hedging swaps and could have a number of adverse effects on any future hedging strategy we may pursue including the following  the doddfrank act may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions and expose us to additional risks related to commodity price volatility commodity price decreases would then have an increased adverse effect on revenues and operations reduced hedging may also impair our ability to have certainty with respect to a portion of our cash flows which could lead to decreases in capital spending and therefore decreases in future production and reserves  if as a result of the doddfrank act or its implementing regulations we are required to post cash collateral in connection with any derivative positions this would likely make it impracticable to implement any hedging strategy  any derivatives counterparties are subject to significant requirements imposed as a result of the doddfrank act we expect that these requirements will increase the cost to hedge because there will be fewer counterparties in the market and increased counterparty costs will be passed on to us         the above factors could also affect the pricing of derivatives and make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms the election of president trump has resulted in uncertainty with respect to the future of the doddfrank act generally and derivative regulation specifically and the future impact this may have on us is currently unknown  table of contents our operations are subject to health safety and environmental laws and regulations which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and which may not be covered by insurance         our oil and natural gas exploration is subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment these laws and regulations impose on our operations numerous requirements including the obligation to obtain a permit before conducting drilling activities restrictions on the types quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment limitations or prohibitions of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands and other protected areas specific health and safety criteria to protect workers and the responsibility for cleaning up any pollution resulting from operations numerous governmental authorities such as the us environmental protection agency or the epa and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil or criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our proposed operations and delays in granting permits and cancellation of leases         under certain environmental laws and regulations we may be liable regardless of whether we were at fault for the full cost of removing or remediating contamination even when multiple parties contributed to the release and the contaminants were released in compliance with all applicable laws in addition accidental spills or releases on our properties may expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and which may not be covered by insurance aside from government agencies the owners of properties where our wells are located the operators of facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are expected to be taken for reclamation or disposal and other private parties may be able to sue us to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations collect penalties for violations or obtain damages for any related personal injury or property damage some sites are located near current or former thirdparty oil and natural gas operations or facilities and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent or costly material handling emission waste management or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations competitive position or financial condition we may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance federal state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas production including hydraulic fracturing as well as government reviews of such activities could result in increased costs additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our production andor ability to book future reserves         we are affected significantly by a substantial number of governmental regulations that increase costs related to the drilling completion production and abandonment of wells the transportation and processing of oil and natural gas the management and disposal of waste and other aspects of our operations it is possible that the number and extent of these regulations and the costs to comply with them will increase significantly in the future in colorado for example significant governmental regulations have been adopted in recent years to address well siting well construction hydraulic fracturing water quality public safety air emissions aesthetics waste management spill reporting land reclamation wildlife protection and data collection these government regulatory requirements may result in substantial costs that are not possible to pass through to our customers and could impact the profitability of our operations  table of contents         hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water sand or other proppants and chemical additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation the water and pressure create fractures in the rock formations which are held open by the proppant enabling the oil or natural gas to flow to the wellbore the process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions in addition the colorado oil and gas conservation commission or the cogcc has adopted and other states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations further on february   colorados air quality control commission fully adopted epas standards of performance for crude oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution adopted corresponding revisions to its emissions reporting and permitting framework and adopted complimentary oil and gas control measures these regulations will affect our operations increase our costs of exploration and production and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce to the extent that we use hydraulic fracturing         some local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and natural gas operations some local governments in colorado for instance have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective beyond that during the past few years a total of five colorado cities have passed voter initiatives temporarily or permanently prohibiting hydraulic fracturing since that time local district courts have struck down the ordinances for certain of those colorado cities and such decisions were upheld by the colorado supreme court in may  nevertheless there is a continued risk that cities will adopt local ordinances that seek to regulate the time place and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities and oil and natural gas operations within their respective jurisdictions         effective march   adams county adopted new amendments to the countys oil and gas regulatory process the new regulations include an enhanced administrative review process which may increase our costs or delay our drilling program         in the event that additional regulations or legal restrictions at the federal state or local level are adopted related to oil and gas production hydraulic fracturing or other development activities in the areas in which we currently or in the future plan to operate we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature and also could become subject to additional permitting and siting requirements and cause us to experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities furthermore these additional costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger companies in the industry which can spread such additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating staff legislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas         in december  the epa determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases or ghg present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the clean air act the epa recently adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources the epa has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states on an annual basis including petroleum refineries as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities  table of contents         the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce ghg emissions and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce ghg emissions primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories andor regional ghg cap and trade programs most of these ghg cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall ghg emission reduction goal         the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce ghg emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for the oil natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce consequently legislation and regulatory programs to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations finally it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in the industry         the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we are in a position to do so we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies used now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology the business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies         we own working and revenue interests in oil and natural gas leasehold interests the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition title insurance covering mineral leaseholds is not generally available and in many instances we forego the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be placed under lease or already placed under lease until the drilling block is assembled and ready to be drilled as is customary in our industry we rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers inhouse landmen or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest we do not always perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title to us in cases involving serious title problems the amount paid for affected oil and natural gas leases can be lost and the target area can become undrillable we may be subject to litigation from time to time as a result of title issues  table of contents the oil and natural gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses         the oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks including  fires  explosions  blowouts and surface cratering  natural disasters  pipe and cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormal pressure formations and  environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil spills pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases         if any of these events occur we could incur substantial losses as a result of  injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property natural resources or equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  cleanup responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations or  repairs necessary to resume operations         if we were to experience any of these problems it could affect well bores gathering systems and processing facilities any one of which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or subject us to monetary liability we may be affected by any of these events more than larger companies since we have limited working capital we currently have general liability insurance with a combined single limit per occurrence of not less than  million for bodily injury and property damage and a combined occurrence limit of  million an excess umbrella liability policy for up to  million and control of well insurance with limits of  million for any one occurrence for other risks however we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance it could adversely affect operations andor our financial condition moreover we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered reasonable terrorist attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our business         the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets used by us in addition the us government has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected oil and natural gas operations to increased risks any future terrorist attack on our facilities customer facilities the infrastructure depended upon for transportation of products and in some cases those of other energy companies could have a material adverse effect on our business  table of contents risks related to the offering and our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline and

particular  the success of our development efforts  failure to successfully implement our business plan  failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget  decline in demand for our common stock  sales of additional amounts of common stock  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  investor perception of our industry or our prospects and  general economic trends         in addition stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile these fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as a result investors may be unable to resell their shares at a fair price investors in this offering will experience immediate substantial dilution of their investment         the public offering price of our common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock therefore if you purchase shares of common stock in this offering you will incur immediate and substantial dilution in the pro forma net tangible book value per share of common stock from the price per share that you pay for the common stock see the section entitled dilution below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you purchase shares in this offering furthermore we expect that we will seek to raise additional capital from time to time in the future such financings may involve the issuance of equity andor securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities we also expect to continue to utilize equitybased compensation to the extent the warrants and options are exercised or we issue common stock preferred stock or securities such as warrants that are convertible into exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock or preferred stock in the future you may experience further dilution  table of contents a small number of existing shareholders own a significant amount of our common stock which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote         our executive officers directors and certain beneficial owners beneficially own approximately  of our common stock under our articles of incorporation and colorado law the vote of a majority of the shares present and voting is generally required to approve most shareholder action as a result these individuals will strongly influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future including votes concerning the election of directors amendments to our articles of incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions we have no existing agreements or plans for mergers or other corporate transactions that would require a shareholder vote at this time however shareholders should be aware that they may have limited ability to influence the outcome of any vote in the future we have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively         we will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for continuation of our development and acquisition program repayment of shortterm debt and other capital and operating expenses we may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire oil and gas assets however we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction we have not allocated these net proceeds for any specific purposes we might not be able to yield a significant return if any on any investment of these net proceeds you will not have the opportunity to influence our managements decisions on how to use the net proceeds from this offering and our failure to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business delay the development of our product candidates and cause the price of our common stock to decline we intend to seek approval from our shareholders to grant our board of directors discretion to implement a reverse split of our common stock for the purpose of among other things meeting the initial listing requirements of the nyse mkt however any reverse split ultimately may not increase our share price         we intend to seek approval from our shareholders to grant our board of directors discretion to implement a reverse split of our common stock prior to the date of this prospectus if necessary to meet the minimum share price of the initial listing requirements of the nyse mkt however the longerterm effect of any reverse split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty and the results of reverse splits by companies in similar circumstances are varied it is possible that the share price of our common stock after a reverse split will not remain increased in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding any reverse split of our common stock will not be accompanied by a reduction in our authorized capital         we do not intend to amend our articles of incorporation in connection with a reverse split to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock accordingly any reverse split would have the practical effect of an increased number of authorized shares of common stock being available for issuance the resulting increase could have a number of effects on our shareholders depending on the exact nature and circumstances of any actual issuances of authorized but unissued shares the practical increase in available authorized shares for issuance could have an antitakeover effect in that additional shares could be issued within the limits imposed by applicable law in one or more transactions that could make a change in control or takeover of our company more difficult similarly the issuance of additional shares to certain persons allied with our management could have the effect of making it more difficult to remove our current management by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of persons seeking to cause such removal  table of contents the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline         we currently have outstanding a significant amount of common stock held by relatively few shareholders in addition we are required to file a resale registration statement in connection with our recently completed private placement covering a significant number of shares of our common stock our common stock is currently thinlytraded and it is likely that market sales of large amounts of common stock or the potential for those sales even if they do not actually occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline which may make it difficult to sell our common stock in the future at a time and price which we deem reasonable or appropriate and may also cause you to lose all or a part of your investment if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline         the trading market for our common stock will depend in part upon the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts if no analysts commence coverage of our company the trading price of our common stock might be negatively impacted if we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage or fails to report about us on a regular basis demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline issuance of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock         we have the authority to issue up to  shares of stock including  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under rules of the nyse mkt we could issue up to  of our then outstanding common stock without shareholder approval and more with that approval these future issuances could be at values substantially below the price paid for our common stock by investors in this offering in addition we could issue large blocks of our stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further shareholder approval because the trading volume of our common stock is relatively low the issuance of our stock may have a disproportionately large impact on its price compared to larger companies the issuance of preferred stock in the future could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock         an issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could upon conversion or otherwise have all of the rights of our common stock our board of directors authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve we have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future         we have not paid dividends on our common stock to date and we may not be in a position to pay dividends for the foreseeable future our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop our business plan and generate revenue from operations further our initial earnings if any will likely be retained to finance our operations any future dividends will depend upon our earnings our thenexisting financial requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors see dividend policy on page  of this prospectus  table of contents

common stock is thinly traded and has not been listed on a national securities exchange the price for our common stock has been volatile and may bear no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations factors that we discuss in this prospectus including the many risks associated with our common stock may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock the

        prior to this offering shares of our common stock have traded on the otcqb marketplace at a price less than  per share and as a result our stock is characterized as a penny stock under applicable securities regulations as a result we have been subject to rules adopted by the sec and finra regulating brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock must furnish the customer with a document containing information prescribed by rule and obtain from the customer an executed acknowledgment of receipt of that document also because of the relatively low trading price of our common stock many brokerage firms may have been unwilling to effect transactions in our common stock         the broker

business and properties our history and organization         we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties and have assembled approximately  net acres including mineral rights only acreage most of which is located in the denverjulesburg basin or the dj basin in northeast colorado our current operating focus is within the wattenberg field of the dj basin which is located primarily in adams and weld counties colorado we have concentrated our efforts in areas where we believe the geomechanical characteristics of the underlying formations offer the potential for greater returns on capital our evaluation metrics include reservoir thickness rock quality and resistivity of each formation each of which affect the number of wells we plan to drill per drilling spacing unit         we have placed particular emphasis on acquiring acreage in an area of the southern wattenberg field in adams county and southwest weld county colorado along with an area southeast of the field which areas we refer to collectively as the southern core where we have assembled approximately  net acres we selected our southern core acreage due to the quality of the hydrocarbon bearing rock the production performance from other nearby wells and the liquidsweighted nature of the production we believe that all of these factors make development of much of our southern core acreage economic in the prevailing commodity price environment we also have recently completed acquisitions in an area in the northern portion of the wattenberg field that previously has yielded hydrocarbon production from both vertical and horizontal wells         our strategy is to continue to leverage our management teams extensive technical land financial and industry operating experience to direct the majority of our capital expenditure program through june   toward drilling operated niobrara and codell horizontal wells and acquire additional leaseholds in the dj basin which we believe will enhance our strategic value since entering the dj basin in  we have grown our position through acquisitions and organic leasing activities consistent with our track record we plan to continue to selectively and opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions in and around our core areas in adams and weld counties         we have an interest in  gross  net productive wells and  gross  net including  net minerals only acres of oil and gas properties with the exception of  gross  net horizontal wells in which we are participating as a nonoperator all of these wells are vertical wellbores over the first quarter of  we produced hydrocarbons at an average rate of approximately  boed at the end of april  our average production exceeded  boed or approximately three times the average first quarter rate at december   we had estimated proved developed reserves of  mboe and proved undeveloped reserves of  mboe with a standardized measure of approximately  million and a pv value of approximately  million based on sec pricing of  per bbl and  per mmbtu for an explanation of the pv value and a reconciliation to the standardized measure see prospectus summarysummary historical reserve data         all of the horizontal wells in which we currently have an interest are operated by independent third parties although we recently began drilling operations on our well shook pad in our todd creek farms prospect we expect to have less than a  interest in any wells as we seek to conserve our capital and diversify risk         our executive and administrative offices are currently located at  maroon circle suite  englewood co  and we maintain a website at wwwpetrosharecorpcom we became a reporting company under the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act in february  when a registration statement for our common stock was declared effective you may access and read our public filings through the secs website at wwwsecgov and on our website  table of contents         as discussed below during  and early  we acquired additional oil and gas assets initiated operations on our own property base and participated as a nonoperator with other oil and gas companies active in the wattenberg field our goal is to diversify risk and minimize capital exposure to development drilling and completion costs in any drilling we expect that our retained working interest will be determined based upon factors such as well costs and geologic and engineering risk business strategies         our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by increasing reserves production and revenue at attractive rates of return on invested capital we are focused on exploiting longlived unconventional oil ngl and natural gas reserves from the dj basin we plan to accomplish our objectives through the execution of the following strategies balanced operated and nonoperated capital program         our management team elected initially to develop our properties in the southern core by participating in nonoperated pads with established operators such as pdc ward and great western the individuals on our management team have extensive experience operating in the dj basin which combined with knowledge gained from our recent nonoperated well participation and observing offset operator activity gives us a strong understanding of the underlying formations and optimal drilling and completion techniques in our area based on this information and the continued derisking and delineation of our position by nearby operators we commenced our operated drilling activities on our shook pad in april  we expect operational control of our properties will enable us to capture operating efficiencies and allow us to control the pace of development and capital outlay aggressively develop our southern core acreage         we intend to aggressively and selectively drill and develop our southern core acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential on our remaining undeveloped acreage we believe that we can drill between  and  horizontal wells per drilling spacing unit depending on the geologic and economic viability of the various niobrara and codell targets utilizing these assumptions we have identified potential drilling locations that could result in up to  net wells in our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects we plan to drill  net operated and participate in  net nonoperated wells through june   pursue strategic acquisitions and increase our leasehold in the wattenberg field         we intend to continue to leverage our management teams extensive relationships to opportunistically increase our acreage holdings at attractive valuations we also intend to pursue organic leasing opportunities corporate mergers or asset acquisitions and farmin related opportunities we have a successful track record of closing oil and natural gas asset acquisitions including the recent acquisitions of well interests and net acres from pdc crimson and morning gun since entering the dj basin without any acreage in  we have rapidly grown our footprint to approximately  net acres see recent acquisitions and developments below for more detail on our acquisitions  table of contents our competitive strengths         we believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on current conditions in the oil and natural gas industry as a result of the following competitive strengths multiyear drilling inventory in the todd creek farms and south brighton prospects targeting the niobrara and codell formations         we believe nearby operator horizontal drilling activity and well results in and around our acreage have significantly mitigated the geologic risk in our drilling program our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects are located in an area where drilling results and the liquidsweighted nature of the assets allow for generating accretive returns even in a low commodity price environment we have identified over  gross horizontal drilling locations up to  net wells on our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects as of december   a majority of these locations have been designated proved undeveloped reserves by our thirdparty reserve engineer we believe we can identify and develop additional locations in these prospects we believe our multiyear drilling portfolio provides the potential for nearterm growth in our production and reserves and highlights the longterm resource potential across our asset base experienced and aligned management team with proven financial technical and operational expertise         our chief executive officer stephen foley has over  years of experience as a real estate developer in colorado with an extensive background in surface development in the areas in which we have acquired acreage our president frederick witsell and chief operating officer william lloyd bring a long history in colorado and depth of experience in the industry to our company mr witsell has over  years of experience in several facets of the oil and gas industry including prospect development conventional and horizontal drilling and completion operations project management gathering and compression systems and marketing and risk management mr lloyd also has over  years of experience in the industry serving in engineering management and senior leadership capacities prior to this offering our directors executive officers and employees owned including all options and warrants approximately  of our company which provides a meaningful incentive to increase the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders our strategic partnerships         in may  we entered into the participation agreement with providence we believe our relationship with providence is instrumental to our success in addition to helping to fund our acquisition and development strategy through our  million initial line of credit the relationship provides us access to providences industry expertise we believe our relationship with providence is strong as evidenced by its participation in all of our southern core acquisitions our borrowing arrangement and providences holdings in our common stock the relationship with providence and its affiliates has led to the acquisition of much of the acreage that we currently hold in addition to our providence relationship our executive officers have developed relationships and formalized agreements with business partners that have and we believe will continue to contribute significantly to our growth through a services agreement executed in  with kingdom we have gained access to a portfolio of oil and gas leases in an attractive portion of the wattenberg field our relationship with kingdom has also provided surface access for drilling operations and water for drilling and production operations on our leasehold interests liquidsweighted reserves         our net proved reserves at december   were comprised of approximately  oil and ngls collectively liquids given the current commodity price environment and resulting disparity  table of contents between oil and natural gas prices on a boe basis we believe our high percentage of liquid reserves and drilling program focused on oilweighted projects compared to our overall reserve base is a key strength meaningful growth opportunities         our relative footprint and size provides us the ability to significantly increase our scale by piecing together acreage blocks that may be considered less attractive to larger operators within our focus area these blocks have meaningful impact on our position as evidenced by the recent pdc crimson and morning gun asset acquisitions and we expect to continue our track record of making these types of acquisitions as we grow our position see recent acquisitions and developments below for more detail on our acquisitions oil and gas properties southern core         we have subdivided our southern core focus area into the todd creek farms south brighton and runway prospects the southern core covers areas in the southern wattenberg field as well as outlying areas to the southeast of the field all of which is a part of the dj basin discovered in  and historically a gas field the wattenberg field now produces both crude oil and natural gas primarily from the niobrara and codell formations the dj basin generally extends from the denver metropolitan area throughout northeast colorado into parts of wyoming nebraska and kansas the majority of the wattenberg field lies in weld county but reaches into adams arapahoe boulder broomfield denver and larimer counties all in colorado         our primary targets in the southern core are the multiple benches in the niobrara formation including the a b and c benches and the codell formation the outlying portions of our southern core acreage including our runway prospect is prospective for the d and j sands         the niobrara formation is a calcareous chalk shale and limestone rock formation varying from approximately  to  feet in thickness and extending from canada to new mexico but the vast majority of the oil and natural gas concentration is in colorado and wyoming the formation generally slopes downward from east to west from kansas to western colorado from hydrocarbon producing depths of approximately  feet to  feet below the surface the codell formation is an oil and natural gas producing tight sandstone formation generally found at depths of approximately  to  feet below the surface and located at the base of the niobrarafort hays limestone member         the d and j sands are present throughout the wattenberg field and contain hydrocarbons at depths ranging from  feet to  feet in the center of the dj basin the d sand is generally economically productive for both oil and gas in vertical wells when such wells encounter higher quality sandstones the j sand is the principal formation in the wattenberg field and produces gas and associated condensate from tight sand reservoirs we have access to d seismic data in the area of our runway prospect which may help us determine the best way to ultimately develop our acreage         the southern core covers areas in adams county and southwest weld county the southern core area saw significant development through vertical drilling in the preceding decades but modern horizontal drilling is relatively new for the area the northern core wattenberg located south of greeley colorado in westcentral weld county has been the primary focus of oil and gas producers for the past seven years however activity in the southern core has picked up significantly over the past two years and according to the cogcc records active operators in the southern core including pdc great western ward and kerrmcgee are increasing their permitting spacing and drilling programs we believe the southern core provides us compelling economics in the current price environment  table of contents         we currently possess a total inventory of over  gross potential horizontal drilling locations up to  net wells on our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects in the southern core including  locations that are fully permitted or in the final permitting stages this horizontal well inventory assumes  to  wells per acre drilling spacing unit with multizone potential in the codell and niobrara a b and c formations this multizone potential has been successfully tested by other operators and we are currently participating as a nonoperator in active development programs with three different established area operators our participation is comprised of multiple horizontal wells targeting the codell and all three benches of the niobrara formation         the table below presents summary information with respect to our current acreage position     total   location   gross

county colorado we have assembled a  gross  net acre position in todd creek farms through our geologic analysis as well as the results from wells in which we have participated as a nonoperator we identified the todd creek farms prospect as being highly prospective for multibench horizontal well development in the niobrara a b c and codell formations south brighton         our south brighton prospect is east of our todd creek farms prospect and sits in northern adams county and southern weld county colorado we acquired the majority of this acreage in our transaction with crimson during  we have leaseholds encompassing  gross  net acres in south brighton we believe south brighton is prospective for multibench horizontal well development in the niobrara and codell formations runway         our runway prospect is east of our todd creek farms and south brighton prospects and lies within adams county colorado east of the denver international airport with the closing of the morning gun acquisition on april   as discussed further below we now have leaseholds encompassing  gross  net acres in the runway prospect most of this acreage is held by production from vertical wells giving us control of the pace of the development of this area nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be prospective for d and j sands and able to be developed using both vertical and horizontal wells  table of contents northern wattenberg field         in addition to our southern core acreage we also have assembled  gross  net acres in the northern area of the wattenberg field a preliminary evaluation indicates that there are  potential gross horizontal drilling locations which could result in up to  net wells on this acreage based on  wells per each acre drilling spacing unit we are the operator on the majority of this acreage giving us control of the pace of the development of this area nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be prospective for multiple benches and zones including both the niobrara and codell formations a number of operators including noble energy inc extraction oil  gas inc and synergy resources corporation dba src energy inc are actively developing acreage in the northern wattenberg field buck peak         in  we drilled and completed our initial twowell program at our buck peak prospect in northwest colorado targeting the niobrara formation those two wells resulted in nominal production and accordingly we are not actively pursuing development in this area we will however monitor activity in the area and continue to evaluate additional opportunities for our  gross  net acres recent acquisitions and developments         during  and early  we took important steps to improve our business by making several lease acquisitions participating as a nonoperator in the drilling of  gross  net horizontal wells in the wattenberg field and completing the permitting process of our first planned operated wells in the southern core our leasing activities have been focused on areas in adams county and southwest weld county colorado in the southern core area supplemental line of credit         on october   we entered into the supplemental line of credit with pep iii the supplemental line of credit permitted us to borrow up to  million to pay costs associated with our acquisition and development of oil and gas properties we have used draws on the supplemental line of credit to pay for certain of our acquisitions including the crimson acquisition discussed below as well as to pay costs associated with our operated and nonoperated drilling programs         as required by an amendment to the supplemental line of credit we repaid approximately  million in outstanding principal on april   and agreed not to borrow additional funds in exchange for pep iii extending the maturity date of the supplemental line of credit we have approximately  million plus accrued interest of approximately  outstanding against the supplemental line of credit all of which is due on june   pdc assets acquisition         on june   we completed the acquisition of the pdc assets the pdc assets include leases covering approximately  gross  net acres located in adams county colorado and pdcs interest in  gross  net productive vertical wells and  horizontal well locations that are permitted providence exercised its option pursuant to the participation agreement and acquired  of the pdc assets much of the acreage we acquired from pdc is within our todd creek farms prospect and held by production while the remainder of the acreage is located in outlying areas of the southern core and is prospective for formations other than the niobrara and codell formations  table of contents         the net purchase price for the pdc assets to our interest was approximately  million following allowances postclosing adjustments and providences acquisition from us of its  interest in the pdc assets we paid the purchase price using a draw on our initial line of credit         following the acquisition we became the substituted operator for all of the wells pdc previously operated the acquisition allows us spacing to drill up to  additional horizontal wells including the  currentlyapproved horizontal well locations on the corcilius pad whether we ultimately drill any wells on the acreage is dependent on many of the factors discussed in this prospectus including receipt of adequate working capital current and projected prices of oil and gas identification of compelling drill locations and obtaining all required permits crimson assets acquisition         on december   we completed the acquisition of the crimson assets simultaneous with the closing of the acquisition providence acquired  of our interest in the crimson assets the crimson assets include oil and gas leases located in adams arapahoe elbert and weld counties colorado covering approximately  gross  net acres and an interest in approximately  gross  net productive wells         the net purchase price to our interest for the crimson assets was approximately  million following allowances postclosing adjustments and providences acquisition from us of its  interest in the crimson assets we paid the purchase price for the crimson assets using a draw on our supplemental line of credit morning gun assets acquisition         on april   we completed the acquisition of the morning gun assets simultaneous with the closing of the acquisition providence acquired  of our interest in the morning gun assets the morning gun assets include oil and gas leases covering approximately  gross  net acres located in adams and weld counties colorado morning gun reserved to itself all rights that exist below  feet above the top of the uppermost j sand formation

drilled or completed to the point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether the leasehold interest is classified as containing proved reserves         following industry standards we generally acquire oil and gas leases without warranty of title except as to claims made by through or under the transferor accordingly we conduct due diligence as to title prior to acquiring properties but we cannot guarantee that there will not be losses resulting from title defects we believe the title to our properties is good and defensible in accordance with industry standards subject to such exceptions that in our opinion are not so material as to detract from the use or value of our properties title to our properties generally carries encumbrances such as royalties overriding royalties contractual obligations liens easements and other matters that commonly affect real property all of which are customary in the oil and gas industry we intend to acquire additional leases by lease sale farmin or purchase         a majority of our buck peak leaseholds are held under paidup fee leases and a majority of our wattenberg field leaseholds are held by production leases that are held by production generally remain in force so long as oil or gas is produced from the well on the particular lease leased acres that are not held by production may require annual rental payments to maintain the lease until the expiration of the lease or the time oil or gas is produced from one or more wells drilled on the leased acreage at the time oil or gas is produced from wells drilled on the leased acreage the lease is considered to be held by production unless production is established within the area covering our undeveloped acreage the leases for such acreage eventually will expire our leases not held by production are scheduled to expire including potential extensions from  until  if our leases expire in an area we intend to

those quantities of oil natural gas and ngl which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably  table of contents certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered all of our proved reserves as of december   we had no proved reserves as of december   were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil natural gas and ngl reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into four broad categories or methods  production performancebased methods  material balancebased methods  volumetricbased methods and  analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance methods for the vast majority of properties certain new producing properties with very little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to similar production both of which are considered to provide a relatively high degree of accuracy nonproducing reserve estimates for developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either volumetric or analogy methods or a combination of both these methods provide a relatively high degree of accuracy for predicting proved developed nonproducing and proved undeveloped reserves for our properties due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data         to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows cawley gillespie  associates inc cawley gillespie considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates         under sec rules reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been fieldtested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and

resources we also have included certain nonoperated properties the operator of which has informed of us of planned development within the next five years and in which we have plans to participate our approximately  mboe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated  million of development capital over the next five years to convert to proved developed reserves         as of december   no proved undeveloped reserves had been converted into proved developed reserves in  we plan to convert approximately  mboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through our well shook pad on which we commenced drilling in april  and the completion of the wells on the jacobucci pad in which we are participating independent reserve engineers         our proved

to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates we do not have a formal committee specifically designated to review our reserve reporting and our reserves estimation process a preliminary copy of the reserve report was reviewed by mr witsell with representatives of our independent reserve engineers and internal technical staff regulatory environment         the production and sale of oil and gas is subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations which may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells noise unitization and pooling of properties setbacks taxation and environmental protection many laws and regulations govern the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the plugging and abandoning of wells the restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled temporary storage tank operations air emissions from flaring compression the construction and use of access roads and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas changes in these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our company         the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties in addition the effect of all these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill although we believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable laws and regulations relating to our oil and natural gas operations we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations because such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted         as an oil and gas operator we are responsible for obtaining all permits and government permission necessary to drill the wells and develop our interests we must obtain permits for any new well sites and wells that are drilled         in february  the cogcc passed extensive rule changes providing perhaps the most stringent oil and gas regulations in the country including statewide requirements commonly known as setbacks from wells and production facilities to various structures         in february  the colorado department of public health and environments air quality control commission or aqcc finalized regulations imposing stringent new requirements relating to air emissions from oil and gas facilities in colorado the new rules impose significantly more stringent control monitoring recordkeeping and reporting requirements than those required under comparable federal rules in addition as part of the rule the aqcc approved the direct regulation of hydrocarbon ie methane emissions from the colorado oil and gas sector         on january   the cogcc approved new rules enhancing local government participation in locating and planning for large scale oil and gas operations the cogcc defined large scale facilities as i any location that proposes eight new horizontal directional or vertical wells or ii cumulative hydrocarbon storage capacity of  bbls or more which are located within an urban mitigation area as defined by cogcc rules the new cogcc rules also include additional notice and consultation requirements for operators when planning such large scale facilities we do not believe that these new large scale facilities regulations impacted us during the year ended december   because our current well sites do not meet the definitions of large scale facilities and we did not have more than eight wells or storage capacity of greater than  bbls prior to the end of the current fiscal year  table of contents         in march  the colorado court of appeals held that colorado oil and gas regulations require the cogcc to grant permits for new oil wells on the condition that requisite levels of environmental and public safety are met based on a determination by an independent third party the court of appeals holding invalidates the cogccs prior balancing inquiry which weighed interests in oil and gas development against environmental and public safety factors the case has been remanded to the lower court for further findings it remains unclear what impact this holding will have on the oil and gas industry         in april  a house in weld county colorado experienced an explosion and fire killing two occupants the cause of the explosion was determined to be natural gas that had seeped from a severed inch flowline into french drains and a sump pit near the house the flowline was connected to a nearby vertical wellbore that recently had been placed back in service in response on may   pursuant to an order by governor hickenlooper the cogcc issued a notice to operators nto requiring all oil and gas operators in colorado to systematically inspect their inventory of pipelines and conduits for natural gas oil condensate or other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons flowlines to verify that any pipeline or flowline not in active use is properly abandoned pursuant to cogcc rules by may   we are required to inspect all pipelines and flowlines that are located within  feet of certain buildings and provide to the cogcc certain information relating to the well tank batteries and flowlines in addition we are required to inspect all abandoned pipelines and flowlines without regard to their distance from any building to verify such pipelines and flowlines were abandoned in accordance with cogcc rules by june   we are required to pressure test all flowlines within  feet of certain building units and ensure and document that these lines have integrity we also are required to abandon all pipelines and flowlines regardless of distance from buildings not in active use not later than june   hydraulic fracturing         we operate primarily in the wattenberg field of the dj basin where the rock formations are typically tight and it is a common practice to utilize hydraulic fracturing to allow for or increase hydrocarbon production hydraulic fracturing involves the process of injecting substances such as water sand and additives some proprietary under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to create pores and fractures thus creating a passageway for the release of oil and gas hydraulic fracturing is a technique that we likely will employ extensively in future wells that we may drill and complete         we expect to outsource all hydraulic fracturing services to service providers with significant experience and which we deem to be competent and responsible our service providers supply all personnel equipment and materials needed to perform each stimulation including the chemical mixtures that might be injected into our wells we require our service companies to carry insurance covering incidents that could occur in connection with their activities in addition to the drilling permit that we are required to obtain and the notice of intent that we provide the appropriate regulatory authorities our service providers are responsible for obtaining any regulatory permits necessary for them to perform their services in the relevant geographic location we have not had any incidents citations or lawsuits relating to any environmental issues resulting from hydraulic fracturing and we are not presently aware of any such matters         in recent years environmental opposition to hydraulic fracturing has increased and various governmental and regulatory authorities have adopted or are considering new requirements for this process to the extent that these requirements increase our costs or restrict our development activities our business and prospects may be adversely affected         the epa has asserted that the safe drinking water act sdwa applies to hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel and in february  it issued final guidance on this subject the guidance defines the term diesel fuel describes the permitting requirements that apply under sdwa for the  table of contents underground injection of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing and makes recommendations for permit writers although the guidance applies only in those states excluding colorado where the epa directly implements the underground injection control class ii program it could encourage state regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing in addition from time to time congress has considered legislation that would provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa if such legislation were enacted hydraulic fracturing operations could be required to meet additional federal permitting and financial assurance requirements adhere to certain construction specifications fulfill monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations and provide for additional public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process         the epa is also conducting a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water in june  the epa released a draft assessment of the potential impacts to drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing for public comment and peer review the assessment concluded that while there are mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources there was no evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the united states the epas science advisory board subsequently questioned several elements and conclusions in the epas draft assessment in december  the epa released the final report on impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified some factors that could influence these impacts         federal agencies have also adopted or are considering additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing on march   the us occupational safety and health administration osha issued a final rule with effective dates of  and  for the hydraulic fracturing industry which imposes stricter standards for worker exposure to silica including worker exposure to sand in hydraulic fracturing in may  the epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act tsca to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing in march  the bureau of land management blm issued a new rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities involving federal and tribal lands and minerals including requirements for chemical disclosure wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water         in colorado the primary regulator is the cogcc which has adopted regulations regarding chemical disclosure pressure monitoring prior agency notice emission reduction practices and offset well setbacks with respect to hydraulic fracturing operations and may in the future adopt additional requirements for this purpose as part of these requirements operators must report all chemicals used in hydraulically fracturing a well to a publicly searchable registry website developed and maintained by the ground water protection council and the interstate oil and gas compact commission         apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations some local governments in colorado for instance have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective beyond that during the past few years a total of five colorado cities have passed voter initiatives temporarily or permanently prohibiting hydraulic fracturing since that time however local district courts have struck down the ordinances for certain of those colorado cities and such decisions were upheld by the colorado supreme court in may  nevertheless there is a continued risk that cities will adopt local ordinances that seek to regulate the time place and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities and oil and gas operations within their respective jurisdictions         during  opponents of hydraulic fracturing also sought statewide ballot initiatives that would have restricted oil and gas development in colorado by among other things significantly increasing the setback between oil and natural gas wells and occupied buildings these initiatives were withdrawn  table of contents from the november  ballot in return for the creation of a task force to craft recommendations for minimizing land use conflicts over the location of oil and natural gas facilities         during  opponents of hydraulic fracturing again advanced various options for ballot initiatives restricting oil and gas development in colorado proponents of two such initiatives attempted to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot for the november  election one would have amended the colorado constitution to impose a minimum distance of  feet between wells and any occupied structures or areas of special concern if implemented this proposal would have made the vast majority of the surface area of the state ineligible for drilling including substantially all of our planned future drilling locations the second proposal would have amended the state constitution to give local governmental authorities the ability to regulate or to ban oil and gas exploration development and production activities within their boundaries notwithstanding state rules and approvals to the contrary if implemented this proposal could have resulted in us becoming subject to onerous and possibly inconsistent regulations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or to outright bans on our activities in various jurisdictions in august  the colorado secretary of state issued a press release and statements of insufficiency of signatures stating that the proponents of the proposals had failed to collect enough valid signatures to have the proposals included on the ballot however similar proposals may be made in the future because all of our operations and reserves are located in colorado the risks we face with respect to such future proposals are greater than those of our competitors with more geographically diverse operations although we cannot predict the outcome of future ballot initiatives statutes or regulatory developments such developments could materially impact our results of operations production and reserves adams county usr process         on march   the adams county board of county commissioners approved amendments to the countys oil and gas regulatory process which ended a temporary drilling moratorium previously imposed the new regulations include an enhanced administrative review process for operators that share a memorandum of understanding or mou with adams county including a sitespecific review of any oil and gas permit application the regulations also require compliance with the usr approval process for oil and gas facilities governed by an mou between the operator and adams county this approval process includes increased notice and submittal requirements the usr process is designed to consist of a sixweek administrative review of the application by the county and appropriate agencies the application can be approved approved with conditions denied or referred to the board of county commissioners for a public hearing if denied the applicant can appeal to the board of county commissioners         in march  we submitted a usr application for our shook pad to adams county which was approved by the county in september  the above newlyenacted regulations in adams county and any additional regulations that may result in the future may delay or prevent our drilling activities and increase our costs of development and production and limit the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce joint operating agreements         we are registered with the cogcc as an operator of oil and natural gas wells and properties in the state of colorado and have posted the appropriate bonds to support our activities we have entered into operating agreements with our working interest partners that stipulate among other things that each partner is responsible for paying its proportionate share of costs and expenses in connection with the wells we operate as operator we are an independent contractor not subject to the control or direction of our other working interest partners except as to the type of operation to be undertaken as provided in the operating agreement further we are responsible for hiring employees or contractors to conduct operations taking custody of funds for the account of all working interest  table of contents partners keeping books and records relating to operations and filing operational notices reports or applications required to be filed with governmental bodies having jurisdiction over operations our liability to the other working interest partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred are limited to losses incurred as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct competition         we encounter significant competition from numerous other oil and gas companies in all areas of operations including drilling and marketing oil and natural gas obtaining desirable oil and natural gas leases obtaining drilling pumping and other services attracting and retaining qualified employees and obtaining capital international developments may influence other companies to increase their domestic crude oil and natural gas exploration competition among companies for favorable prospects can be expected to continue and we anticipate that the cost of acquiring properties will increase in the future most of our competitors possess larger staffs and greater financial resources than we do which may enable them to identify and acquire desirable producing properties and drilling prospects more economically our ability to acquire additional properties and to explore for oil and natural gas prospects in the future depends upon our ability to conduct our operations evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment         the oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introduction of new products and services using new technologies if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected market for our products         currently all of our produced oil and gas is sold under a variety of month to month contracts with local marketing companies we have no longterm marketing contract commitments at this time the oil produced from our wattenberg field properties including the pdc and crimson assets is sold at spot prices to thirdparties minus a discount from the current wti price         the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas depends upon numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production and importation of oil and gas the relative status of the domestic and international economies the proximity of our properties to gas pipeline systems the capacity of those systems the marketing of other competitive fuels fluctuations in seasonal demand and governmental regulation of production refining transportation and pricing of oil gas and other fuels employees         we currently have ten employees including our chief executive officer president and chief operating officer our chief financial officer serves in his role as an independent contractor we also engage a number of other independent contractors and consultants to supplement the services of our employees including land services geologic mapping reservoir and facilities engineers drilling contractors attorneys and accountants company facilities         our executive and administrative offices are currently located at  maroon circle suite  englewood colorado  where we lease approximately  square feet at a rate of  per month legal proceedings         from time to time we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business no legal proceedings government actions administrative actions investigations or claims are currently pending against us or our officers and directors in which we are adverse  table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview         the following discussion summarizes our plan of operation for the next  months and the related anticipated capital expenditures it also analyzes i our financial condition at march   and december   and compares it to december   and  respectively and ii our results of operations for the three months ended march   and  and the years ended december   and  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in this prospectus and with the understanding that the actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect         we were organized on september   under the laws of the state of colorado to investigate acquire and develop crude oil and natural gas properties in the rocky mountain and midcontinent region of the united states following the acquisition of the pdc crimson and morning gun assets and our participation in several drilling programs as a nonoperator we have an interest in  gross  net oil and gas wells located in the dj basin after assignment to our working interest partners we have approximately  net acres in our buck peak prospect and  net acres in the dj basin which we are in the process of developing         as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company our revenue results of operation cash flow from operations reserve values access to capital and future rate of growth are influenced by the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas changes in prices can affect both positively and negatively our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing operating results and the amount of oil and natural gas that we choose to produce prevailing prices for such commodities fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control such as global political and economic conditions inherently the price received for oil and natural gas production is unpredictable and such volatility is expected all of our production is sold at market prices and therefore the amount of revenue that we realize as well as our estimates of future revenues is to a large extent determined by factors beyond our control to date we have not entered into hedging arrangements with respect to any of our future production but we may choose to do so in the future         under the terms of the participation agreements covering our prospects and operating agreements with other third party operators we are required to pay our proportionate share of the costs of any wells in which we participate in exchange we are entitled to a proportionate share of the revenue net of related expenses         we cannot fully determine what impact the volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices may have on our ongoing and future operations if such volatility continues into the future our decision on whether to drill and complete wells is based on both the prevailing commodity prices and the cost to drill such wells our ability to acquire financing andor properties drill wells identify working interest andor industry partners may all be negatively impacted by downward fluctuations in the price of oil and gas revision of prior period financial statements         in connection with the preparation of our condensed financial statements for the quarter ended march   we identified an error related to the manner in which we accounted for the fair value of convertible promissory notes and warrants issued in our private placement during december  on the balance sheet at december   we recorded the face value of convertible notes payable issued in connection with the private placement under liabilities discounted by i the value of the original issue discount and ii the value of the warrants issued to the placement agent we did not  table of contents however discount the value of the convertible notes payable by the fair value of the warrants issued to individual investors as part of the units sold in the private placement         in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no  materiality and sab no  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements we evaluated the error and determined that the related impact was not material to our results of operations or financial position for any prior annual or interim period accordingly we corrected these errors for the year ended december   by revising the condensed financial statements for the quarter ended march   and making conforming adjustments to our financial statements for the year ended december   that are presented in this prospectus for additional information please see note  to the financial statements for the quarter ended march   and note  to the financial statements for the year ended december   included in this prospectus going concern         as described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this uncertainty is based on our substantial nearterm liabilities limited revenue and negative working capital among other things which existed as of march   we are dependent on obtaining funding from operations and the sale of debt or equity to continue as a going concern our plan of operations as set forth below is subject to our obtaining adequate working capital of which there can be no assurance         at march   we had a cash balance of approximately  million and other current assets of approximately  million subsequent to march   our cash balance has decreased significantly as we have paid certain acquisition and development costs including costs previously accrued and general and administrative expenses in june  we are obligated to repay approximately  million in principal and approximately  in accrued interest to satisfy the terms of our supplemental line of credit and approximately  accrued interest payment on our initial line of credit and an approximately  accrued interest payment on our outstanding convertible promissory notes we also will incur additional expenses related to our recently commenced operated drilling program on our shook pad during the second and third quarters of this year we had net losses of approximately  million during the three months ended march   and  million during the year ended december           our ability to continue as a going concern depends on the success of our current drilling efforts future exploration and development efforts and our ability to generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs and expenses in the event we are unable to obtain adequate funding from our ongoing drilling efforts both operated and nonoperated and through the sale of debt or equity securities we may have to delay reduce or eliminate certain of our planned operations reduce overall overhead expense or divest assets this in turn may have an adverse effect on our ability to realize the value of our assets plan of operation and expected capital expenditures         our plan of operation for the next  months includes i continuing the development of our operated drilling programs including on the shook corcillius and brighton lakes pads in the southern core ii participating as a nonoperator in drilling projects operated or to be operated by thirdparties iii identifying other lease and asset acquisitions in and around the southern core iv managing the wells we purchased from pdc and crimson and v monitoring activity near our buck peak prospect our plan of operation is contingent upon our obtaining adequate working capital from operations and proceeds from this offering our goal is to become a leading independent producer of crude oil and natural gas and liquids in the wattenberg field         we plan to use the net proceeds from this offering along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations including from our nonoperated wells and equity and debt financings as necessary to  table of contents embark on an aggressive drilling program to convert our undeveloped leasehold position to production cash flow and reserves through june   we plan to spend approximately  million to drill  net operated horizontal wells and approximately  million to participate in the drilling of  net nonoperated wells in the southern core we also have budgeted approximately  million for additional completion costs relating to the recently completed  gross  net jacobucci pad wells in which we are participating as a nonoperator and  million for additional leasehold acquisitions and working capital         the following table

second operated pad is expected to be the corcillius pad on which we have permitted  wells targeting the codell and niobrara formations however we do not expect to begin any drilling operations on the corcillius pad until early          under our operated capital plan through june   we plan to drill and complete  gross  net operated horizontal wells on our shook pad and  gross  net operated horizontal wells on our corcillius pad for a total capital expenditure of approximately  million  table of contents south brightonoperated activity         we anticipate that our first operated drilling program at south brighton will be the brighton lakes pad on which we have an application pending for  extendedrange lateral wells we expect the pad to consist of up to  codell wells and

operated capital plan through june   we plan to drill and complete  gross  net operated horizontal wells on our brighton lakes pad for a total capital expenditure of  million todd creek farmsnonoperated activity         during  and the first quarter of  we participated in the drilling and completion of  gross  net horizontal wells in todd creek farms all of these wells are operated by companies with an established track record in the wattenberg field including pdc great western and ward in addition to the aforementioned wells we have been informed that great western and ward plan to collectively drill up to  additional gross wells on pads in todd creek farms over the next  to  months while as a nonoperator we are unable to control whether and when these additional wells will be drilled and completed we have allocated a total capital cost of  million for an additional  wells net to our interest         the pdc jacobucci pad where we have working interests ranging from  to  is currently on production and flowing back into the sales pipeline the jacobucci pad is comprised of  midrange horizontal wells including  codell wells  niobrara b wells and  niobrara c wells in the same area we participated in  extendedrange lateral wells that are operated by great western on its marcus pad targeting the two separate benches in the niobrara with an approximately  working interest in each well the marcus pad wells had day average daily production rates of  and  gross boed per well respectively we also participated in one standardrange lateral codell well with an approximately  working interest operated by ward on its riverdale pad which had a day average daily production rate of  gross boed south brightonnonoperated activity         we have not participated in any nonoperated wells in south brighton however industry activity has picked up and we expect to receive notice to participate in wells from operators on our acreage over the next  months each of great western edge petroleum ward and hrm resources has acreage offsetting our south brighton acreage edge petroleum has permitted  standardrange lateral wells in south brighton in which we have a  working interest however edge petroleum has not submitted an authorization for expenditure on these wells and they may or may not be drilled by june   runway         a number of public and private company operators are developing acreage near our position and we plan to monitor these operators results we believe this area to have extensive hydrocarbon saturation in tight sand reservoirs at this time we do not plan on allocating any capital to this area over the next  months however we will monitor nearby activity and may increase allocated capital to our runway prospect if we feel the riskadjusted returns on capital meet internal return targets northern wattenberg field         at this time we do not plan on allocating any capital to our northern wattenberg field prospect over the

emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of  the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed  billion subject to adjustment for inflation  the last day of the fiscal year during which occurs the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering  the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt or  the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer under the exchange act  table of contents         as an emerging growth company we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to the following  not being required to obtain an auditor attestation under section b of the sarbanesoxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements  exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and from holding a vote for stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved  presenting not more than two years of audited financial statements to make our registration statement effective with respect to an initial public offering and  providing executive compensation disclosure under item  of regulation sk to the extent required by smaller reporting companies as defined by rule of the sec         certain exemptions described above are also available to us as a smaller reporting company specifically the reduced disclosure obligation regarding executive compensation presenting not more than two years of audited financial statements and not being required to obtain an auditor attestation under section b of the sarbanes oxley act are the same for an emerging growth company such as ours that qualifies as a smaller reporting company         section b of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards thus an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and as a result we are not required to adopt any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates when adoption of such standards are required for other public companies while we are not required to adopt any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates we may elect to do so critical accounting policies use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements         the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses         our significant accounting policies are described in note  of the notes to financial statements included as part of this prospectus we have identified below the policies that we believe are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management we analyze our estimates including those related to oil and gas reserve estimates on a periodic basis and base our estimates on historical experience independent third party reservoir engineers and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting  table of contents policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements successful efforts method of accounting         our application of the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas exploration and production activities requires judgments as to whether particular wells are developmental or exploratory since exploratory costs and the costs related to exploratory wells that are determined to not have proved reserves must be expensed whereas developmental costs are capitalized the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and application of industry experience wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and natural gas in quantities insufficient to be economic which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date on occasion wells are drilled which have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and in such instances an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results the evaluation of natural gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires managements judgment of exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions oil and gas reserves         our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil natural gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation our independent petroleum engineers cawley gillespie prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of all of our properties on a wellbywell basis the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the  quality and quantity of available data  interpretation of that data  accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and  judgment of the independent reserve engineer         one of the most significant estimates we make is the estimate of oil natural gas and ngl reserves oil natural gas and ngl reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given area may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity production history projected future production economic assumptions relating to commodity prices operating expenses severance and other taxes capital expenditures and remediation costs and these estimates are inherently uncertain for example if estimates of proved reserves decline our depreciation depletion and amortization dda rate will increase resulting in an increase in net loss a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of oil and gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge which would increase our loss we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods         the recent significant decline in oil natural gas and ngl prices increases the uncertainty as to the impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves we are unable to predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market a prolonged period of depressed  table of contents commodity prices may have a significant impact on the value and volumetric quantities of our proved reserve portfolio assuming no other changes to our development plans or costs depreciation depletion amortization and accretion         our dda rate is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves which incorporate various assumptions and future projections if our estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline the rate at which we record dda expense increases which in turn increases our net loss such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices or other changes to reserve estimates as discussed above and we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploration and development program as well as future economic conditions impairment of proved oil and gas properties         proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment annually or when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying amount of such property we estimate the expected future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare these undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows we will write down the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value the factors used to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of reserves future commodity prices future production estimates estimated future capital expenditures estimated future operating costs and discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the projected cash flows impairment expense for proved oil and gas properties is reported in impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations which increases accumulated depletion depreciation and amortization         our impairment analyses requires us to apply judgment in identifying impairment indicators and estimating future cash flows of our oil and gas properties if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information we may be exposed to an impairment charge impairment of unproved oil and gas properties         unproved oil and gas properties consist of costs to acquire unevaluated leases as well as costs to acquire unproved reserves we evaluate significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment based on remaining lease term drilling results reservoir performance seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage when successful wells are drilled on undeveloped leaseholds unproved property costs are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unitofproduction basis impairment expense and lease extension payments for unproved properties is reported in exploration expenses in the statements of operations accounting for business combinations         we account for all of our business combinations using the purchase method which is the only method permitted under fasb asc   business combinations  and involves the use of significant judgment in connection with a business combination the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date any excess or shortage of amounts assigned to assets and liabilities over or under the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase or goodwill the amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  table of contents         in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination we make various assumptions the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties if sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties we must prepare estimates to estimate the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of gas oil and ngl reserves we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows for estimated proved reserves the future net cash flows are discounted using a marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition the marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional projectspecific risking factors to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves when a discounted cash flow model is used the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk factors in some instances market comparable information of recent transactions is used to estimate fair value of unproved acreage         estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future a higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher dda expense which results in increased net loss fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices reserves quantities operating expenses and development costs this increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in an increase in net loss for the period in which the impairment is recorded asset retirement obligations         our asset retirement obligations aro consist of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil natural gas and ngl wells removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and land restoration in accordance with applicable local state and federal laws and applicable lease terms the fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset the recognition of an aro requires management to make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities amounts and timing of settlements the creditadjusted riskfree discount rate to be used and inflation rates in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro we must recognize periodtoperiod changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows increases in the aro liability due to the passage of time impact operating results as accretion expense the related capitalized cost including revisions thereto is charged to expense through dda over the life of the oil and gas property stock based compensation         we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie blackscholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors the determination of the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and the expected stock option exercise behavior         our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and marketbased implied volatility the volatility rate was derived by examining historical stock price behavior and assessing managements expectations of stock price behavior during the term of the option the term of the options was derived based on the simplified method calculation the simplified method allows companies that do not have sufficient historical experience to provide a reasonable basis for an  table of contents estimate to instead estimate the expected term of a plain vanilla option by averaging the time to vesting and the full term of the option plain vanilla options are options with the following characteristics  the options are granted atthemoney  exercisability is conditional only upon performing service through the vesting date  if an employee terminates service prior to vesting the employee would forfeit the options  if an employee terminates service after vesting the employee would have a limited time to exercise the options typically  to  days and  the options are nontransferable and nonhedgeable the company periodically evaluates the applicability of using the simplified method with respect to the characteristics noted above to estimate the expected term of our options and will continue to do so as our business continues to evolve if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period recent accounting pronouncements         please refer to recent accounting pronouncements in

respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful a person must be found to be entitled to indemnification under this statutory standard by

independent counsel or shareholders have approved the indemnification based on a finding that the person has met the standard indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses         our articles of incorporation limit the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the cbca specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary

natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves are the most significant of the companys estimates all reserve data included in these financial statements are based on estimates reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a

continued income taxes         the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered the company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not asset retirement obligation         asset retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets are accounted for in accordance with asc  accounting for asset retirement obligations the estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement abandonment and restoration of crude oil and natural gas properties is recorded generally upon the completion of a well the net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a risk adjusted rate over the estimated economic life of the crude oil and natural gas properties such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset the asset is depleted on the unitsofproduction method the liability is periodically adjusted to reflect  new liabilities incurred  liabilities settled during the period  accretion expense and  revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements the accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation depletion accretion and amortization expense in the accompanying statements of operations share based compensation         the company uses the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fairvalue of stockbased awards in accordance with asc  compensation the optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the options expected life the price volatility of the underlying stock and the estimated dividend yield of the underlying stock the companys expected term represents the period that stockbased awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on the contractual terms of the stockbased awards vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stockbased awards as there was insufficient historical data available to ascertain a forfeiture rate the plain vanilla method was applied in calculating the expected term of the options the companys common stock has limited historical trading data and as a result the expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that share similar operating metrics and histories the company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future and as such the expected dividend yield is zero loans and borrowings         borrowings are recognized initially at fair value net of financing costs incurred and subsequently measured at amortized cost any difference between the amounts originally received and the redemption value of the debt is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the period to maturity using the effective interest method f petroshare corp notes to financial statements continued december   and  note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies continued fair value of financial instruments         fair value accounting as prescribed in asc section  utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level    unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level    quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and level    prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable supported by little or no market activity going concern assessment         pursuant to asu  the company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these financial statements substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events

        management has evaluated these conditions and determined that a reduction in the working capital deficit subsequent to december   related to a private placement note  and an extension and amendment to the companys supplemental line of credit note  coupled with anticipated increased revenues from the companys nonoperated and operated properties will allow the company to meet its maturing debt and interest obligations and continue as a going concern through march           as part of the analysis the company considered selective participation in certain nonoperated drilling

conditions plus company overhead incurred and  future net cash flows are discounted to present value by applying a discount rate of          the assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those prescribed by the fasb and the sec these assumptions do not necessarily reflect the companys expectations of actual revenues to be derived from those reserves nor their present value the
