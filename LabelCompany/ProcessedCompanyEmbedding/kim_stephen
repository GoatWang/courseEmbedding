product manager or become a better one here are my quick thoughts on what makes an awesome product manager if you already work in product i’d be curious to hear your feedback  customer empathy the biggest question i always ask when working on something new is “who is the customer for this product” know everything about your customers obsessively if you can map out how a customer spends a typical workday then you can start to think about their problems from their perspective rather than from your product’s perspective in addition to the qualitative know the quantitative metrics as well as a product manager you need to understand the data about how users are interacting with your product and what types of interactions are good for customer health  resourcefulness as a product manager everything begins and ends with you beyond the typical skills you might expect such as ux design knowledge around specific technologies data analysis and general business acumen you often need to go beyond your comfort level to get things done that might mean helping to sell your product alongside salespeople that might mean reading  pages of thirdparty api documentation to find that one endpoint that could make or break a feature it might mean chasing down that one beta customer for the perfect testimonial on your website do whatever it takes  humility most product managers do not have direct reports and for good reason your job is to help move an organization’s product forward using your best judgment and you cannot do it alone you must earn the trust and respect of others an arrogant product manager can be absolutely toxic in an organization when critiquing others’ ideas assume good intent when you fail admit it openly and move on quickly to redeem yourself acknowledge the help you receive from others and make them feel rewarded never give the impression that the product will move in a certain direction only “because you said so”  fortitude part of the challenge of being a product manager is staying humble while staying true to a product vision at the same time although you want to be front and center whenever someone has a new idea you also have to say “no” to a lot of people do not compromise all of the research and knowledge you have amassed because something new and shiny comes along learn how to stay the course and bring people along with you even if they disagree  passion people will often rely on you for the energy required to take a bold stance when introducing something new to the market you need to be a selling to the salespeople instilling the belief in them that you have done your homework if you are not passionate and excited about your product assume that no one will feel that way i hope that helps — comments are welcome jquery slideshow built in minutes leave a reply i had to build a jquery slideshow aka an image carousel that scrolls automatically and i struggled to find the right plugin for the job on such short notice i just hacked up something quick and dirty using jquery ui here’s the demo for my jquery slideshow if you’re interested in jumping straight into the code httpcodepeniostephenkimpenpcgwe there are a few steps i had to go through to get this working nicely… the html i went for a super simple setup where i have three buttons at the top that serve as selectors for the different images that the user can view in the slideshow div classrowofcircles div classcircle circle selectedcirclediv div classcircle circlediv div classcircle circlediv div div classimage imagediv div classimage imagediv div classimage
