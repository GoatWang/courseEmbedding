company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on june   the purposes for which the corporation was organized were  to engage in any lawful business from time to time authorized by the board of directors  to act as principal agent partner or joint venturer or in any other capacity in any transaction  to do business anywhere in the world and  to have and exercise all rights and powers from time to time granted to the corporation by law from  until  the company was dormant and undertook no activities beginning in  the company explored the option of entering into a joint venture to develop a mercury mining property at mercury mountain nevada as a part of these activities the company through the sale of its common stock raised funds to engage the services of an independent mining engineer to prepare a report on the feasibility of the project by late  it had been determined that the project did not warrant any further investment from that time until  the companys activities concentrated on maintaining its corporate existence and looking for other opportunities for the company in may of  new management was appointed a shareholders meeting was held amendments to the companys articles of incorporation were approved and additional effort was made by new management to make the company a viable merger candidate these efforts included engaging the services of a certified public accounting firm to audit the companys financial statements obtaining an opinion of counsel as to the tradability of the companys outstanding shares preparation of the information required by rule c and applying to the otc bulletin board for trading on the medium      by september of  no viable acquisitions or merger candidates had been located for the company and management became aware that the company would be required to register its shares under the securities exchange act of  in order to maintain its stock on the otc bulletin board management determined that the company needed new management which might be better positioned to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate and which would be in a position of funding the upcoming expenses of the company on september   management of the company resigned and claudio gianascio was appointed as sole director and officer on november   the company sold  of its common stock to mr gianascio for  per share netting a total of  on november   the company filed a registration statement on form sb which became effective sixty days thereafter      the company had an initial authorized  capital of   consisting  of  shares of  par value common stock on june   the shareholders approved an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the company changing the authorized capital to  shares at a par value of  and providing for a  to  share forward split of the outstanding shares the articles of amendment were filed with the state of nevada on august        in the summer of  the company completed a private placement of  units for which it received  each unit consisted of one share of common stock one a warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase upon a minimum of  days prior notice of exercise one share of common stock at  per share within two years of the date of issuance and one b warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase upon a minimum of  days prior notice of exercise one share of common stock at  per share within two years of the date of issuance both a  b warrants expired without exercise  business      other than the  abovereferenced  matters  and  seeking  and  investigating potential  assets  properties or businesses to acquire  the company has had no business  operations  since  inception to provide revenue on an interim basis the company has held its funds in interest bearing bank accounts made short term loans to reputable unaffiliated corporations and funded the pursuit of one lawsuit      to the extent that the  company  intends to continue  to seek the  acquisition  of assets  property  or  business  that may benefit the company and its  stockholders  it is  essentially  a blank  check company  because  the  company has  limited  assets and  conducts no  business management  anticipates  that any such  acquisition  would  require  it to issue shares of its common stock as the sole  consideration for the acquisition  this may result in substantial  dilution of the shares of current  stockholders  the companys  board of  directors  shall  make the final  determination  whether to complete any such  acquisition  the approval of stockholders will not be sought unless  required by  applicable  laws  rules and  regulations  its articles of incorporation  or bylaws  or contract  the company makes no assurance that any future enterprise will be profitable or successful      the company is not currently engaging in any substantive business activity and has no plans to engage in any such activity in the foreseeable future  in its present form the company may be deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company  the company does not intend to restrict its search to any particular business or industry and the areas in which it will seek out acquisitions  reorganizations  or mergers may include  but will not be limited to the fields of high technology  manufacturing  natural resources  service research and development communications  transportation insurance brokerage finance and all medically related fields  among others  the company recognizes that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to it may be extremely limited and may be restricted to entities who desire to avoid what these entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering ipo  the most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements legal and accounting costs the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares the lack of or the inability to obtain the  required financial  statements  for such an undertaking  limitations  on the  amount of  dilution  to public  investors  in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities along with other conditions or requirements  imposed by various federal and state securities laws rules and regulations  any of these types of entities  regardless of their  prospects would require the company to issue a substantial  number of shares of its common stock to  complete  any such  acquisition  reorganization  or  merger  usually amounting to between  and  percent of the outstanding shares of the company following the completion of any such transaction  accordingly  investments in any such private  entity  if available  would be much more  favorable than any investment in the company      in the event that the company engages in any transaction resulting in a change of control of the company  andor the  acquisition  of a  business  the company will be required to file with the commission  a current  report on form k within the time periods provided for  a filing on form k also requires the filing of audited financial statements of the business acquired as well as pro forma financial information  consisting of a pro forma condensed balance sheet pro forma statements of income and accompanying explanatory notes      management intends to consider a number of factors  prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor none of which may be determinative  or provide  any  assurance  of  success  these may include but will not be limited to an analysis of the quality of the entitys management  personnel  the  anticipated  acceptability  of any new  products or marketing concepts  the merit of technological  changes  its present financial condition  projected  growth potential and available  technical  financial and managerial  resources  its working  capital  history of operations  and future prospects  the nature of its present and expected competition  the quality and experience  of its  management  services  and the depth of its  management  its potential  for  further  research  development  or  exploration  risk  factors specifically  related to its  business  operations  its  potential  for growth expansion and profit  the  perceived  public  recognition  or acceptance of its products  services  trademarks  and name  identification  and numerous  other factors  which are  difficult  if not  impossible  to properly  or  accurately analyze let alone describe or identify without referring to specific objective criteria       regardless the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future by reason of changing market  strategies  plant or product  expansion  changes in product  emphasis future management  personnel and changes in innumerable other factors  further in the case of a new  business  venture  or one  that  is in a  research  and development mode the risks will be substantial  and there will be no objective criteria to examine the  effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business  objectives  also a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established and with no past track record the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty      management  will  attempt  to  meet  personally  with  management  and  key personnel  of the entity  sponsoring  any business  opportunity  afforded to the company  visit and inspect material facilities  obtain independent analysis or verification  of  information   provided  and  gathered   check  references  of management  and key  personnel  and conduct other  reasonably  prudent  measures calculated to ensure a reasonably  thorough  review of any  particular  business opportunity  however  due to time constraints of management  these activities may be limited      the company is unable to predict the time as to when and if it may actually participate in any specific  business  endeavor  the company  anticipates  that proposed  business  ventures  will  be made  available  to it  through  personal contacts  of  directors   executive   officers  and   principal   stockholders professional advisors broker dealers in securities  venture capital personnel members  of the  financial  community  and others  who may  present  unsolicited proposals  in certain cases  the company may agree to pay a finders fee or to otherwise  compensate  the persons who submit a potential  business  endeavor in which  the  company  eventually  participates  such persons  may  include  the companys directors  executive officers beneficial owners or their affiliates in this  event  such  fees may  become a factor  in  negotiations  regarding  a potential acquisition and  accordingly  may present a conflict of interest for such individuals      although the company has not identified any potential  acquisition  target the possibility  exists that the company may acquire or merge with a business or company in which the companys executive officers directors  beneficial owners or their affiliates may have an ownership interest  current company policy does not prohibit such  transactions  because no such transaction is currently contemplated it is impossible to estimate the potential  pecuniary benefits to these persons      further substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of these types of acquisitions reorganizations or mergers ranging from a small amount to as much as  these fees are usually divided among promoters or founders  after deduction of legal  accounting and other related expenses and it is not  unusual  for a  portion  of  these  fees  to be paid  to  members  of management or to principal  stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them  in the event that such fees are paid  they may  become a factor in  negotiations  regarding  any potential acquisition by the company and accordingly may present a conflict of interest for such individuals principal products and services       the limited  business  operations  of the  company  as now  contemplated involve those of a blank check company the only activities to be conducted by the  company  are to  manage  its  current  limited  assets  and to seek out and investigate the  acquisition of any viable business  opportunity by purchase and exchange for securities of the company or pursuant to a reorganization or merger through which securities of the company will be issued or exchanged  distribution methods of the products or services      management will seek out and  investigate  business  opportunities  through every reasonably available fashion including personal contacts  professionals securities broker dealers  venture capital personnel  members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals the company may also advertise its  availability as a vehicle to bring a company to the public market through a reverse reorganization or merger status of any publicly announced new product or service      none not applicable competitive business conditions      management  believes  that there are  literally  thousands of blank check companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by the company  many of  these  companies  have   substantial current  assets  and  cash  reserves competitors  also  include  thousands  of other  publiclyheld  companies  whose business  operations  have proven  unsuccessful  and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publiclyheld vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets there is no reasonable way to predict the  competitive  position of the company or any other  entity in the strata of these endeavors  however the company having limited assets and cash reserves  will no doubt be at a  competitive  disadvantage  in  competing  with entities which have recently  completed  ipos  have significant cash resources and have recent operating  histories when compared with the complete lack of any substantive operations by the company for the past several years sources and availability of raw materials and names of principal suppliers       none not applicable dependence on one or a few major customers      none not applicable patents trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts      none not applicable need for any governmental approval of principal products or services      because the company currently produces no products or services it is not presently subject to any governmental regulation in this regard however in the event that the company  engages in a merger or acquisition  transaction  with an entity  that  engages  in  such  activities  it  will  become  subject  to  all governmental  approval  requirements to which the merged or acquired  entity is subject research and development      none not applicable  cost and effects of compliance with environmental laws     none not applicable  however  environmental  laws rules and regulations may have an adverse  effect on any business  venture viewed by the company as an attractive  acquisition  reorganization or merger candidate  and these factors may further  limit the number of potential  candidates  available to the company for acquisition reorganization or merger number of employees      none item a   risk factors      the companys business is subject to numerous risk factors including the following      the company has had very limited operating history and no revenues or earnings from operations the company has no significant assets or financial resources the company will in all likelihood sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues at least until the consummation of a business combination this may result in the company incurring a net operating loss which will increase continuously until the company can consummate a business combination with a target company there is no assurance that the company can identify such a target company and consummate such a business combination      going concern as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company incurred a net loss of  during year ended december   and accumulated losses of  since inception at in  the companys current liabilities exceed its current assets by  at december   these factors create an uncertainty as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance of common stock borrowing from existing shareholders andor the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue      our proposed business plan is speculative in nature   the success of the companys proposed plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations financial condition and management of the identified target company while management will prefer business combinations with entities having established operating histories there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in locating candidates meeting such criteria in the event the company completes a business combination of which there can be no assurance the success of the companys operations will be dependent upon management of the target company and numerous other factors beyond the companys control      the company is and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with and acquisitions of business entities a large number of established and wellfinanced entities including venture capital firms are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be merger or acquisition target candidates for the company nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than the company and consequently the company will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination moreover the company will also compete with numerous other small public companies in seeking merger or acquisition candidates      the company has no current agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with or acquisition of a specific business entity however it continues to evaluate various possibilities and have discussions with various parties there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying and evaluating suitable business opportunities or in concluding a business combination management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation by the company there is no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable to the company the company has not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings assets net worth or other criteria which it will require a target company to have achieved or without which the company would not consider a business combination with such business entity accordingly the company may enter into a business combination with a business entity having no significant operating history losses limited or no potential for immediate earnings limited assets negative net worth or other negative characteristics       our management has limited time to devote to our business   while seeking a business combination management anticipates devoting only a limited amount of time per month to the business of the company the companys sole officer has not entered into a written employment agreement with the company and he is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future the company has not obtained key man life insurance on its officer and director notwithstanding the combined limited experience and time commitment of management loss of the services of this individual would adversely affect development of the companys business and its likelihood of continuing operations      the companys officer and directors participate in other business ventures which may compete directly with the company additional conflicts of interest and nonarms length transactions may also arise in the future  management has adopted a policy that the company will not seek a merger with or acquisition of any entity in which any member of management serves as an officer director or partner or in which they or their family members own or hold any ownership interest      reporting requirements may delay or preclude an acquisition   section  of the securities exchange act of  the exchange act requires companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one or two years depending on the relative size of the acquisition the time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target companies to prepare such financial statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the company acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the exchange act are applicable      the company has neither conducted nor have others made available to it market research indicating that demand exists for the transactions contemplated by the company even in the event demand exists for a merger or acquisition of the type contemplated by the company there is no assurance the company will be successful in completing any such business combination      the companys proposed operations even if successful will in all likelihood result in the company engaging in a business combination with only one business entity consequently the companys activities will be limited to those engaged in by the business entity which the company merges with or acquires the companys inability to diversify its activities into a number of areas may subject the company to economic fluctuations within a particular business or industry and therefore increase the risks associated with the companys operations      potential for being classified an investment company   although the company will be subject to regulation under the exchange act management believes the company will not be subject to regulation under the investment company act of  insofar as the company will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities in the event the company engages in business combinations which result in the company holding passive investment interests in a number of entities the company could be subject to regulation under the investment company act of  in such event the company would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs the company has obtained no formal determination from the securities and exchange commission as to the status of the company under the investment company act of  and consequently any violation of such act could subject the company to material adverse consequences       a business combination involving the issuance of the companys common stock will in all likelihood result in shareholders of a target company obtaining a controlling interest in the company any such business combination may require shareholders of the company to sell or transfer all or a portion of the companys common stock held by them the resulting change in control of the company will likely result in removal of the present officer and director of the company and a corresponding reduction in or elimination of his participation in the future affairs of the company  currently there are no pending acquisitions business combinations or mergers      the companys primary plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a business entity which in all likelihood will result in the company issuing securities to shareholders of such business entity the issuance of previously authorized and unissued common stock of the company would result in reduction in percentage of shares owned by the present shareholders of the company and would most likely result in a change in control or management of the company      federal and state tax consequences will in all likelihood be major considerations in any business combination the company may undertake currently such transactions may be structured so as to result in taxfree treatment to both companies pursuant to various federal and state tax provisions the company intends to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both the company and the target company however there can be no assurance that such business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a taxfree reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended taxfree treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets a nonqualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction      management of the company will request that any potential business opportunity provide audited financial statements one or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business combination with the company rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements in such case the company may choose to obtain certain assurances as to the target companys assets liabilities revenues and expenses prior to consummating a business combination with further assurances that audited financial statements would be provided after closing of such a transaction  closing documents relative thereto may include representations that the audited financial statements will not materially differ from the representations included in such closing documents      our stock is subject to the penny stock rules which impose significant restrictions on the brokerdealers and may affect the resale of our stock    our stock is subject to penny   stock trading rules and investors will experience resale restrictions and a lack of liquidity a penny stock is generally a stock that · is not listed on a national securities exchange or nasdaq     · is listed in pink sheets or on the nasd otc bulletin board     · has a price per share of less than  and     · is issued by a company with net tangible assets less than  million      the penny stock trading rules impose additional duties and responsibilities upon brokerdealers and salespersons effecting purchase and sale transactions in common stock and other equity securities including · determination of the purchasers investment suitability     · delivery of certain information and disclosures to the purchaser and     · receipt of a specific purchase agreement from the purchaser prior to effecting the purchase transaction       due to the penny stock rules many brokerdealers will not effect transactions in penny stocks except on an unsolicited basis  when our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock trading rules · such rules may materially limit or restrict the ability to resell our common stock and     · the liquidity typically associated with other publicly traded equity securities may not exist      it is possible that a liquid market for our stock will never develop and you will not be able to sell your stock   there is no assurance a market will be made in our stock  if no market exists you will not be able to sell your shares publicly making your investment of little or no value item   description of property      the company has no assets property or any physical business office or other facilities its principal executive office address is the business office  address  of its transfer agent interwest transfer co inc which as a courtesy to its clients provides mail forwarding services  because the company has had no  business  its  activities  will be limited to keeping itself in good standing in the state of nevada seeking out acquisitions   reorganizations   or  mergers  and   preparing  and  filing  the appropriate  reports  with  the  securities  and  exchange commission   these activities

adverse to the company or has a material interest adverse to the company in any proceeding   part ii item   market for common equity and related stockholder matters market information      there is no public market for shares of common stock of the company although the companys shares are quoted on the otc markets otcqb the company is aware of only a few transactions that have taken place in the previous ten years in any event no assurance can be given that any market for the  companys  common stock will develop or be maintained      the ability of an individual shareholder to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that state  a number of states require that an issuers securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration before the securities are permitted to trade in that state  presently the company has no plans to register its securities in any particular state  further most likely the companys  shares will be subject to the provisions of section g and rule g of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act commonly referred to as the penny stock rule  section g sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks and rule gd incorporates the definition of penny stock as that used in rule a  of the exchange act       the commission generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than  per share subject to certain exceptions  rule a provides that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the commission authorized for quotation on the nasdaq stock market issued by a registered investment company excluded from the definition on the basis of price at least  per share or the issuers net tangible assets or exempted from the definition by the commission  if the companys shares are deemed to be a penny stock trading in the shares will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally persons with assets in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  together with their spouse      for transactions covered by these rules brokerdealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and must have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase  additionally for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require the delivery prior to the first transaction of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market  a broker dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities  finally monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks  consequently these rules may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to trade andor maintain a market in the companys common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares holders     the number of record holders of the companys common stock as of the date of this report is approximately  dividends      the company has not declared any cash dividends with respect to its common stock and does not intend to declared dividends in the foreseeable future  the future dividend policy of the company cannot be ascertained with any certainty and until the company completes any acquisition reorganization or merger as to which no assurance may be given no such policy will be formulated there are no material restrictions limiting or that are likely to limit  the  companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock securities authorized for issuance under equity

engaged in any material operations or had any revenues from operations since inception  the companys plan of operation  for the next   months is to  continue  to seek the  acquisition of assets  properties  or businesses  that  may  benefit  the  company  and  its stockholders management intends to focus its efforts outside the united states both because management is located in europe and because management believes that the company can locate superior acquisition opportunities outside the united states  management anticipates that to achieve any such acquisition the company will issue shares of its common stock as the sole consideration for such acquisition       during the next  months the companys only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining  the  company in good  standing  or the  payment of expenses  associated  with  reviewing or  investigating  any potential  business venture  which  the  company  expects  to pay from its  cash  resources as of december   it had  in cash management does not believe that these funds are sufficient to cover its cash needs for the next  months if additional funds are required during this period such funds may be advanced  by  management  or stockholders as loans to the company because the company has not identified any such venture as of the date of this report it is impossible to predict the amount of any

     net loss for the year ended december   was  compared to a net loss of   for the year ended december   this loss represents an decrease of  or  this increase in loss is attributable to decreased travel and exploratory costs partially offset by increased costs associated with regulatory reporting and increases in professional fees liquidity      the companys primary need for capital has been to pay the ongoing administrative expenses associated with being a reporting company such as legal accounting and edgar filing the company although more aggressively seeking an acquisition or merger partner and incurring travel and other expenses in relation thereto does not anticipate this changing in the next  months unless a suitable acquisition or merger candidate is located however because of the limited amount available no assurance can be given that this will be the case      during the fiscal years ended december   and  the company has been able to pay its expenses and costs through its cash on hand as of december   the company had  in cash compared to  in  and accounts payable of  and  at december   and  respectively leaving the company without minimal working capital the company intends to maintain its operations in a manner which will minimize expenses but believes that present cash resources are not sufficient for its operations for the next  months however it
