patxi’s pizza gets boost from private equity investment posted in investment san francisco california patxi’s pizza gets boost from private equity investment exec says deal will help chain compete with fastcasual brands the patxi’s pizza chain is ramping up growth and testing new ovens that will help the fullservice deepdish concept compete with the growing crop of fastcasual pizza players the san franciscobased patxi’s — pronounced “pahcheese” — closed on a deal in february that gave privateequity firm karpreilly llc a controlling interest terms of the deal were not disclosed but bill freeman patxi’s chief executive said the growth capital will help support the unit chain’s planned expansion the chain plans to open four more units in  and another five to eight units in  the goal is to reach plus units within five years freeman said all units will be company owned and the chain has no plans to franchise freeman a former telecommunications entrepreneur founded patxi’s in  with friend and pizza chef francisco “patxi” azpiroz their aim was to create a warm and inviting neighborhood pizza joint offering chicagostyle deepdish pies with quality ingredients more recently patxi’s has been perfecting a thincrust addition to the menu the chain is testing and likely to roll out new electric degree ovens made specifically for thincrust pies that allow the chef to dial in the ideal cooking temperature for the top and bottom of the pizza thincrust pizzas will bake in about  minutes in the new ovens versus roughly  minutes in the chain’s existing ovens designed for the original signature deep dish that means guests will be able to order a custom pizza that can be served at a speed that would be more conducive to lunch it also means that patxi’s will be able to compete more directly with rapidly growing fastcasual pizza players like mod pizza blaze fast fire’d pizza and pizzarev “we can bake a pizza just as quickly as they can” noted freeman unlike the fastcasual pizza chains however patxi’s does about half of its business in dineout and delivery orders patxi’s also has a full bar with about  beers on tap the average check is about  and average unit volumes top  million in restaurants that are typically between  and  square feet said freeman the chain has recorded samestore sales increases of  percent or more over the past five years “overall the quality of our food is what differentiates us” he said “but people also see us as a great value you feel like you had a  experience for ” freeman said the partnership with karpreilly is a good fit for patxi’s karpreilly has a long history of investment in the restaurant space including chains such as café rio burger lounge café zupas habit burger grill miller’s ale house marie callender’s z tejas

gentlemen almost a year has passed since karpreilly wrote to the board of directors expressing its interest in acquiring  of the equity of charlotte russe holding inc �charlotte russe� or the �company� clearly we were disappointed when the board declined to engage in a constructive dialogue with us in the time that has elapsed charlotte russe has lost its chief executive officer chief financial officer general merchandise manager and head of human resources in the meantime samestore sales have declined overhead spending has increased and new unit expansion has been curtailed we believe that investors have lost confidence in the company�s current direction as evidenced by a  decline in the company�s share price since the week high today the company is severely weakened with no stable senior management team no growth plans and dim prospects moreover it faces one of the most difficult and unpredictable consumer environments in years even after a replacement senior management team has been hired it will be new to charlotte russe and perhaps new to the challenging juniors retailing industry and it seems certain that they will not have worked together as a timetested team while the company wrestles with all of these specific challenges in such an uncertain economic environment the risks to the shareholders of charlotte russe are enormous we believe these issues can be reversed yet we do not believe they can be reversed without fundamental change change which will be very difficult to implement in the context of being a public company based on these beliefs we are submitting this nonbinding proposal on behalf of karpreilly capital partners lp and affiliates �karpreilly� and hig capital llc and affiliates �hig� to acquire  of the stock of charlotte russe holding inc at a range of between  and  per share in cash our proposal represents a  to  premium to the most recent closing price of  we think the transaction represents the best alternative to the public shareholders as well as the company and its employees and we strongly prefer to complete this investment with friendly cooperation from the board and the company towards that end we would expect to be at the upper end of our range in a friendly transaction in which the board cooperates openly with our due diligence and agrees to release mark hoffman the company�s former ceo from the current restrictions imposed by the board restrictions which prevent mark from working with prospective acquirers of the company we fail to see the benefit that such restrictions provide to the company�s shareholders november   board of directors charlotte russe holdings inc page  � assuming a cooperative transaction we will require  days of confirmatory due diligence to finalize our proposal given allan karp�s twelve years of history as a major shareholder of the company including eleven years on the board we are very familiar with the business and foresee no issues arising during this short diligence period to expedite closing and to remove uncertainty that would be created by relying on thirdparty debt financing karpreilly capital partners lp along with its affiliated coinvestors investment funds advised by jpmorgan asset management and hig capital llc are prepared to fund this acquisition with  equity from their respective committed investment funds our combined equity commitments of  million to  million together with excess cash of charlotte russe represent more than enough capital to complete the acquisition in the range we have indicated and pay transaction expenses an equity commitment letter from investment funds advised by jpmorgan asset management is attached to this letter we will not require a financing contingency in the definitive merger agreement background on karpreilly� hig capital as you know allan karp has been a shareholder of charlotte russe since  and served on the board of directors from  to  along with previous
