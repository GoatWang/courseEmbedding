security holders all of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will go to the selling security holders as described below in the sections we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders the primary source of competition will come from the manufacturers and distributors directly those that have the resources and inclination to handle these tasks inhouse will not need our services developing and executing such promotions and other marketing techniques is typically one of their responsibilities however because many do not have the time money or people to do so they use outside companies such as · large national and local marketing agencies such as digitas httpdigitascom interpublic httpintercomagency and omnicom httpomnicomgroupcom · alcoholic beverage sampling companies such as hauspromotions httphauspromotionscom and cea httpclassieentertainmentagencycom · local merchandising companies the large marketing agencies do not have an expertise in craft beer and are often too expensive for much of our target market to engage while the sampling companies do have expertise in the alcoholic beverage industry they are geared primarily towards the mass brewers  anheuser busch miller coors crown imports and heineken  and other imagedriven wine and spirits companies as a result they do not generally have expertise in the education needed to effectively promote craft beers local merchandising companies are too small to identify and are not widely spread throughout all of the major markets in between these competitors there is a niche area that we plan to fill company description we were incorporated on october   under the laws of the state of nevada we are in the business of providing merchandising and consulting services to craft beer brewers and distributors as well as providing additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations as needed while we do not directly produce alcoholic beverages we provide services to help businesses in the industry improve their marketing sales and operations our business activities thus far have been concentrated in and around the philadelphia pennsylvania market the company was founded by andrew gavrin a seasoned businessman who has worked in the alcoholic beverage field for the past  years after working as a strategy consultant for consumer product and other companies mr gavrin recognized the need for an independent third party company that could help craft brewers and distributors create and implement marketing promotional and merchandising plans while working in the industry following  years as a strategy consultant his experience of developing strategies and watching a sales force and distributor implement them with limited success due to competing priorities led him to launch the company mr gavrin began working on our business model in the summer of  and formed the company in october  alcoholic beverages are sold in the onpremise class of trade bars restaurants taverns and similar businesses where drinkers consume the alcohol immediately at the location and the offpremise class of trade grocery stores convenience stores liquor stores package stores and other retail locations where drinkers purchase their alcohol to consume later outside of the property of the store the threetier alcohol beverage system in the united states mandates that  with some minor exceptions  alcohol beverage manufacturers such as breweries and wineries must sell their product through a distributor who in turn sells it to the retailer manufacturers and distributors together market the brand in order to sell it to consumers both tiers manufacturers and distributors have sales forces that have numerous priorities that include executing promotions for the brand in the onpremise class of trade holding sampling events where legal in both onpremise and offpremise locations and building displays of the product in the offpremise class of trade due to limited resources and competing priorities these sales forces are not as effective as they can be and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could assist in developing and executing these strategies based on the experience of mr gavrin who developed such strategies and the implementation plan for the countrys largest craft brewer we will develop and execute the following marketing techniques for alcohol beverage manufacturers and distributors · providing general branding support including marketing research naming and graphic design help · building and merchandising displays of product in the offpremise class of trade · executing sampling promotions where legal in the onpremise and offpremise class of trade · developing andor executing promotions in the onpremise class of trade · manning sampling booths at local beer festivals · development andor execution of other sales and marketing strategies additionally we will provide services for retailers and other organizations using craft beer including but not limited to · organizing promoting and managing beer festivals ·
