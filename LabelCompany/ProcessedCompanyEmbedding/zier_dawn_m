experience in directtoconsumer marketing which is how the fort washington diet company sells most of its products slideshow qa with nutrisystem ceo dawn m zier advertisment of gallery facebook icon twitter icon pinterest mail icon but zier had another qualification unmatched by any previous ceo of nutrisystem then  she precisely matched the companys target customer  a woman in her s struggling to lose  pounds conversely nutrisystem looking gaunt desperately needed to fatten up with  revenue at  million down from  million in  its shares were trading at  a tenth of what they commanded in  nutrisystem lost  million in its last fiscal year question do you think your special qualification matters on wall street answer i dont tend to talk about being a female ceo because i dont think its relevant in the investor world but in terms of understanding the customer its very relevant q how so a i have a deeper understanding for how people largely women struggle with weight and how its an emotional issue a nutritional issue and a physical issue it all has to come together in the diet experience im very empathetic toward that because as a female ive also struggled with that q shares have gone up  with nutrisystem now trading in the upper teens your weight is down by how much a over the last  months i lost  pounds q using nutrisystem a ive tried weight watchers ive tried jenny craig ive tried nutrisystem ive tried them all obviously i recommend nutrisystem q any new years resolutions a i would like to lose  pounds q how about the companys weight problem a when i came in november  the company had been suffering revenue declines for the last five years im a big believer that its easy to drive revenue but you have to make sure its profitgenerating revenue one of my first focuses was to get the margins back in place q did you immediately try to change the product in time for the allimportant new years diet resolution firstquarter a i came in november so i had no ability to impact diet season so this is my first diet season which we are very excited about q you came to nutrisystem after  years at readers digest publishing diets whats the link a readers digest was a great training ground for direct marketers  database marketing thats so important to nutrisystem q how so a when we look at the diet for diet season  its really about nutrisystem my way a more personalized and customized weightloss experience to build on that we need to do more in the area of database marketing q what motivated your weight loss a i think my wakeup moment was seeing a photo of myself i decided enough was enough  if this was a business problem i would solve it q whats your nemesis a ice cream q how do you cope a there are nutrisystem ice cream sandwiches which really help me ice cream sandwiches are  calories instead of an ice cream sundae which is about  calories   nutrisystem headquarters fort washington business weight loss ticker ntri fridays close  down   revenue

lead inspired how dawn zier engineered a healthy turnaround for nutrisystem by samantha drake photography by mitro hood when dawn zier became president and ceo of the struggling nutrisystem inc in  she instituted a practice of celebrating employee successes big and small the steppedup recognition helped get the workforce excited about the company and on the road to reversing several years of declining revenue a year later at a quarterly companywide gathering four employees took over the qa portion of the meeting to express their gratitude for zier’s leadership and guidance then they presented zier with a sheet cake and a certificate of appreciation to mark her oneyear anniversary the surprise honor was a sign that the oncedispirited workforce had bought into zier’s philosophy of celebrating the small wins that lead to big successes zier the first female ceo in nutrisystem’s year history is bringing the fort washington pabased company back to top form zier announced on april  that nutrisystem achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of yearoveryear revenue growth total revenue for  is estimated to be in the range of  million to  million nutrisystem has  employees half of whom work in the company’s customer contact center in addition to its fort washington headquarters nutrisystem has distribution centers in nevada and pennsylvania zier won’t disclose the number of customers nutrisystem has she says merely that the company has helped “millions of people lose millions of pounds over the years” “as a busy mom and a working professional it’s hard to find time to do everything structured weightloss programs do help you lose weight” says zier  who acknowledges her own issues with weight twothirds of the american population is considered overweight or obese and at any given time there are  million people dieting says zier that means there’s no shortage of potential customers but there’s no shortage of competition either nutrisystem sets itself apart from the weightloss program heavyweights like weight watchers and jenny craig by providing busy dieters with portion control and a structured plan nondieters may recognize nutrisystem as the company with the longtime celebrity spokespeople marie osmond and dan marino nutrisystem sells structured homedelivered weightloss meal plans and meals that are frozen and ready to go including popular bars and shakes customers buy food packages containing a month’s supply of breakfasts lunches dinners snacks and desserts that are either preselected or determined by the customer customers provide their own fresh fruits vegetables and dairy nutrisystem also offers complimentary counseling from trained weightloss counselors registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators with additional support available through its online community and tools while proponents like the absence of caloriecounting or monthly weighins critics have said the structured meal plans leave little room for deviation such as eating out at a restaurant fluctuating fortunes nutrisystem’s fortunes have yoyo’ed wildly since its founding in  by philadelphia entrepreneur harold katz in willow grove pa initially named shapeup the business eventually launched  companyowned and franchised locations called nutrisystem centers which offered weightloss products and counseling katz sold the business in  and went on to found the h katz capital group a private equity firm in southampton pa subsequent leadership of nutrisystem boosted sales to more than  billion according to forbes magazine but mounting debt lawsuits related to food safety and the fallout from a federal trade commission investigation into nutrisystem’s claims about the performance and safety of its weightloss programs ultimately took a heavy toll nutrisystem filed for bankruptcy in  nutrisystem emerged from bankruptcy that same year under new ownership the company ventured into selling its products online and went public in  but despite the fresh start and shedding of its system of companyowned and franchised centers nutrisystem continued to struggle forbes reported in  an investor group headed by michael hagan acquired the company and named hagan ceo and chairman of the board the company had what hagan calls “a good run” between  and  before he moved on and became ceo at lifeshield inc in langhorne pa under hagan nutrisystem’s revenues grew from  million to  million forbes named him entrepreneur of the year in  for his achievements at the company but without hagan’s leadership nutrisystem faltered once again this time faced with a recession as well as increasing competition at the board’s request hagan rejoined nutrisystem’s board of directors in  he led the search to find a new ceo who could turn the company around specifically nutrisystem needed a leader who possessed a deep knowledge of direct and ecommerce marketing and who could address myriad problems in the organization hagan notes engineering solutions zier came from reader’s digest where she had worked from  to  in a variety of posts among them zier served as president of the publishing company’s international and european businesses and oversaw the global and consumer marketing divisions although marketing became her focus zier actually started out in engineering she earned a degree in computer science and electrical engineering from stony brook university and a master’s degree in electrical engineering from the massachusetts institute of technology mit followed by a master’s in business administration from mit her first job out of stony brook was a technical staff position at att and zier transitioned into marketing in her next job at chase manhattan corp zier says her engineering background provided the foundation for how she solves problems “when you’re writing code or designing a circuit you tend to do it in pieces and modules so when i problem solve i tend to break it down into modules or components similar to the way my mind was wired for writing software” she explains “you can take a problem that seems big and daunting and break it down into different subsegments and all of a sudden it doesn’t seem as scary or as challenging” when zier joined nutrisystem in november  the organization had more than its share of challenges these included a stagnating portfolio of weightloss products a misguided focus on discounts and a corporate culture that was adrift says hagan zier quickly made her mark on the company “dawn has overdelivered on all of her promises” hagan says noting that nutrisystem’s stock has roughly tripled since she took over turning the company around was no small feat says keira krausz nutrisystem’s chief marketing officer and a former reader’s digest colleague who joined the company in february  “almost everything needed to be fixed in some regard” she notes krausz describes zier as a very handson ceo who can quickly pinpoint problems and issues “she’s definitely not afraid to roll up her sleeves” she says for example zier can look at a large excel spreadsheet of numbers and spot a number that doesn’t look right saying “i smell smoke there” she’ll immediately pull out a calculator to figure out the problem herself krausz says adding “on any day of the week she’ll jump in as you need her to” culture shift understanding the company’s culture was one of zier’s first priorities maintaining a productive culture in a workplace can fall by the wayside in the drive for results “but if you don’t have the right foundation in place you’re not going to succeed” she says zier started by listening to what employees across all departments had to say and heard that several years of declining revenue had resulted in feelings of resignation and defeat in many people the challenge zier realized was getting employees who hadn’t experienced success in a long time excited and passionate about their work “i think the team was a little beaten down” she says “they needed hope but i always say that hope’s not a strategy so we actually needed results” zier set clear expectations for employees and goals for the company she gave every person in the company in a leadership role a laminated handout containing the goals for the year and strategies for achieving them it’s nutrisystem’s “bible for the year” and helps keep everyone on the same page says zier to ensure discussions and decisions are supported by numbers and facts not conjecture and hypothesis zier put in place what she calls a “just the facts culture” “i was really regimented in making sure we had the facts which i think comes from my engineering background” she notes the acronym facts stands for focused accountable customercentric teamoriented and solutiondriven zier explains and is intended to remind employees to focus on the priorities clearly understand their goals listen to customers without making assumptions work as a team and be driven to find solutions recently nutrisystem began celebrating employees’ everyday successes in a campaign called “makingithappen” if someone goes above and beyond in the organization or demonstrates passion for the work he or she is recognized each month says zier the achievement could be anything from a notable number of sales to negotiating a great medical benefit she adds robert f bernstock a member of nutrisystem’s board of directors who participated in hiring zier credits her with facilitating the company’s new attitude “a lot of the cultural change comes from dawn herself” he says noting zier’s strong work ethic along with her ability to work collaboratively while holding people accountable were very attractive attributes she’s “a straight shooter and a good listener” who has a clear sense of the path forward bernstock says at the same time zier says she needed to demonstrate from the top down that “if something didn’t go exactly as planned it wasn’t game over it was game starting” if plan a didn’t work they simply had to move on to plan b and plan c if necessary she says bumps still occur of course agrees krausz “but i see a major difference in how people react to those bumps” kraus says it’s no secret that zier is very competitive and competitive people realize that sometimes you lose a game except when it comes to playing sports at company picnics zier quickly joins the best volleyball team so she can be on the winning side krausz explains adding “she can’t just show up like the rest of us and laugh about it she has to win for her everything is fullout” product placement nutrisystem’s revenue decline between  and  was attributed in part to the recession triggered by the economic crisis in  ineffective sales and marketing strategies also played a significant role “a lot of what happened was selfinflicted wounds” acknowledges zier in an effort to boost sales the company had started discounting its products which is not a good sales strategy says zier nutrisystem was also talking less about weight loss and more about how inexpensive the food was both strategies were misguided and sent the wrong message to customers she says zier took a different direction by making select nutrisystem products available at certain retail outlets for the first time the directtoconsumer channel has a lot of potential for the company she notes nutrisystem’s fiveday weight loss kit for example is available at walmart stores and on amazoncom and is designed to give consumers who wouldn’t ordinarily buy the product a chance to sample it dieters can lose several pounds in just one week a quick win that lays the groundwork for more success “studies show that the initial weight loss is actually very motivating” says zier nutrisystem also now offers its snacks as a standalone product in addition to being part of the meal packages although zier is generally very analytical krausz says her reasoning behind making snacks more available was simply “people snack” in addition the company is focusing on developing more options for dieters with specific needs including vegetarians and people with diabetes nutrisystem’s focus on diabetes isn’t new but under zier’s guidance the company created more options for diabetics and also began selling the diabetic meals through its retail partners to meet dieters’ growing desire for more fresh food nutrisystem is testing a new delivery program called simply fresh all meals are shipped to customers via fedex and can be prepared in less than five minutes the food including fresh fruits and vegetables is kept cool during shipment in a specially designed temperaturecontrolled carrier zier’s efforts to understand and cultivate nutrisystem’s customer base haven’t gone unnoticed “nutrisystem is a little more attuned to what customers want” says john larosa president at marketdata enterprises inc in tampa fl which recently released its biennial study the us weight loss  diet control market nutrisystem’s fortunes are on the upswing again because of its focus on good management and serving the customers he says nutrisystem is well positioned for the future because of its diverse products and services and its partnerships with retailers notes larosa yet nutrisystem’s biggest competition isn’t from other weightloss programs it’s from doityourself dieters with shrinking budgets and increasing time commitments he says a decade ago diy dieters comprised  percent of the dieting market today that figure is  percent points out la rosa among its recent initiatives nutrisystem launched numi a digital device that integrates with wearable fitness devices and health platforms personal stake if zier’s leadership style makes her one of nutrisystem’s most effective ceos it also makes her one of its most relatable leaders one of nutrisystem’s marketing themes is “put yourself first” zier puts this idea into practice in her own life by making time for exercise — particularly biking whether it’s outdoors or in a spin class — and spending time with her husband and two children because zier’s principal residence is not in pennsylvania she spends a lot of time commuting to fort washington both she and krausz have lengthy drives to work so they sometimes use that time to discuss the business zier downplays her role as nutrisystem’s first female ceo while emphasizing her insight into the company’s customers “i really don’t think about female versus male or things like that” she explains “but i think certainly as a woman who has also struggled with weight that i do bring a good perspective to the company for really understanding our customers” threequarters of nutrisystem’s customers are women zier notes so the ability to spin her experiences into every woman’s experience is an asset to her job “my issues with my weight are what i think  percent of the population has so i think it’s something we can all relate to” she notes “i think most women in america have dieted at one point” whether someone is trying to transform physically or revitalize a company change is never easy or simple but just as nutrisystem encourages new dieters with small quick weightloss victories zier is banking on the new culture of innovation and optimism she’s created at the company to continue building a new future as zier notes “success begets success” ceo samantha drake is a freelance writer based in lansdowne pa contact us at editorialsmartceocom turnaround tips nutrisystem inc president and ceo dawn zier has been on the job for just a few years but has already put the company well on the road back to success turning an organization around financially and culturally is a tall order and means the new leader has to hit the ground running zier gives the following advice to ceos facing big challenges listen closely in typical turnaround situations the company culture has contributed to inhibiting the company’s growth zier says listening to the employees across all departments is the key to understanding the culture and what the company’s issues are in fact a ceo’s first month on the job should be all about listening build a team zier brought several former colleagues with her to nutrisystem to help her assess the situation and reinvigorate the company but she was careful to create a diverse team “i was really big on making sure i had a melded team of newcomers as well as people who had been valuable to the company over time” zier points out “i didn’t want to create an ‘us versus them’ culture” move fast importantly zier didn’t wait to start launching new initiatives she relied on what she calls the “day rule” a new leader has just  days to start enacting change “you’ve got to move fast and you’ve got to be brave” says zier take chances turning a company around is the time to be bold zier says she decided not long after she joined nutrisystem that the company should start selling selected products at walmart going into retail for the first time was a risk but zier says she knew nutrisystem had to strike out in a promising new direction focus on the facts given her engineering background dawn zier president and ceo of nutrisystem inc approaches problems with an analytical eye she built a “facts” culture at the company to base decisions on numbers and facts not just gut feelings and speculation focused we prioritize our activities and act with a sense of urgency on those initiatives which will meaningfully move our business forward accountable we take responsibility for our commitments decisions and actions and own
