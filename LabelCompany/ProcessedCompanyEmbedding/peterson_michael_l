of the problem major attempts to square gods justice with the presence of evil such as augustinian irenaean process openness and felix culpa theodicies and debates on the problem of evil covering such concepts as best possible world natural evil and natural laws gratuitous evil skeptical theist defense and the bearing of biological evolution on the problem the second edition includes classical
