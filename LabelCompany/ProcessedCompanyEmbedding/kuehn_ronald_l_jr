pictures – executive vice president and general counsel southern natural resources – vice president and general counsel sonat – vice president and general counsel – president and chief operating officer – chief executive officer – chairman el paso corporation – chairman of the board  interim ceo address el paso corporation  louisiana street houston texas  httpwwwelpasocom ■ the wellcredentialed ronald l kuehn jr was a veteran of the natural gas energy business having led the transformation of southern natural resources to its new identity as sonat and on through the merger of sonat with el paso corporation to his misfortune he hit a snag at el paso a company embroiled in scandal with its shareholders and the securities exchange commission he willingly stepped in the line of fire to serve as interim chief executive officer of el paso while the company repositioned itself to meet its debt and resolve its controversies early exposure to conflict and negotiation the son of a new york police officer kuehn was born in brooklyn in  and raised in queens attending fordham university on a basketball scholarship where he played point guard he began to develop negotiating skills as floor general for his teammates by nature kuehn was softspoken—a skill not necessarily in demand on the basketball floor he compensated by developing a persuasive manner to negotiate plays and positions for the team those skills were to become important in later life after receiving his bachelors degree from fordham in  he left the area to briefly serve as a first lieutenant with the us army from  to  upon discharge he returned to fordham and earned a law degree in  for the next four years he worked as an associate attorney with hughes hubbard  reed in new york city and then served as vice president and general counsel for allied artists pictures also in new york a move into the energy industry in  kuehn landed a job in the legal department of southern natural resources of birmingham alabama a natural gas energy provider organized and disciplined he became a rising star particularly remembered for his lowkey personality and nonthreatening manner in various legal negotiations in  southern natural was renamed sonat and within months kuehn was named vice president and general counsel the next year he was elected president a position he held until the  merger of sonat with el paso along the way kuehn also held concurrent positions as chief operating officer chief executive officer starting in  and chairman from  at sonat kuehn handled the many ups and downs peculiar to the energy business with characteristic reserve he weathered low natural gas prices by stepping up exploration and production ep which added to the companys reserves and served the company well when gas prices again rose the company struck out on a few ep investments but also purchased zilkha energy in  in an effort to boost its assets selim zilkha would become both friend and foe to kuehn in later years in  the el paso corporation another energy provider announced plans to acquire sonat in a highly negotiated stockswapping measure intended to benefit both entities the combined assets would mean control of  percent of all natural gas pipelines in the united states making el paso the largest natural gas pipeline company in the country although kuehn officially retired at the time of the merger the deal also established that he would serve as the nonexecutive chairman of el paso until december  in  kuehn then semiretired stayed on as lead director for el paso trouble brews with the purchase of sonat el paso had entered the ep area of the industry and its ep holdings were significantly enhanced when it acquired yet another company coastal corporation in  when enron crumbled in december  a company that el paso had tried to emulate the tides turned in  the california public utility commission charged el paso with intentionally holding back capacity on four pipelines from november  to march  contributing to an energy crisis and artificial rise in electricity prices that cost california residents an extra  billion soon the us attorneys office in houston served subpoenas on el paso and several other energy traders in an investigation of what is known as roundtrip trades swaps between two energy companies eg electricity and natural gas for the purpose of artificially manipulating price or inflatingdeflating volume by mid el pasos stock had fallen from around  a share in early  to a shocking  per share significant shareholder zilkha whose company kuehn had bought just months before the sonat–el paso merger accused kuehn and others of mismanagement and started a shareholder uprising in june  to overthrow el pasos entire board of directors at that time el pasos chief executive officer resigned amid controversy and the company announced that kuehn would act as its interim chief to provide strong leadership and stability with characteristic coolness and calm kuehn was able to diffuse the proxy contest with zilkha by incorporating several of the recommendations voiced by the dissidents the power struggle failed but kuehn began selling assets cutting expenses and paying off debt to maintain shareholder confidence a permanent ceo douglas foshee took over in september  but kuehn remained as lead director on the board in february  based on the findings of an independent review el paso announced that it had overestimated by  percent its gas reserves and would have to revise corporate financial statements from  to  company stock fell to  a share although neither kuehn nor other thencurrent senior executives were implicated in any wrongdoing others were nonetheless in april  a class action lawsuit against el paso was filed in a texas federal court naming kuehn and several others as defendants on behalf of shareholders the suit charged among other things that kuehn and others knowingly or recklessly had participated in grossly overstating in the companys oilandgas reserves costing shareholders millions of dollars in lost revenues from falling stock prices see also entry on sonat inc
