exeo entertainment e review big potential  exeo entertainment inc otcmktsexeo  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»exeo entertainment e review big potentialjun  about exeo entertainment exeo john dempsey growth ipossummaryexeo is rated a strong longterm buy based on the quality of its product offerings in three distinct sectors video gaming audio and smart tvsexeos current products include psyko  gaming headphones krankz wireless bluetooth onear headphones and zaaz smart tv keyboardsexeo needs to effectively communicate its story to consumers and implement a solid marketing campaign to pull sales through established retail channelsif exeo can execute its plan there is the potential for  million in salesexeo entertainment exeo entertainment inc otcqb otcqbexeo formed in  and based in las vegas nevada designs builds markets and sells psyko™  gamer headphones and krankz™ bluetooth® headphones and will soon release its zaaz™ keyboard for smart tvs on june   exeo displayed its products at the electronic entertainment expo e  held at the los angeles convention center e is the largest international show for video gaming hardware and software products exeo entertainments website can be viewed at exeoentcom psyko™ patented  gaming headphones psyko™  gaming headphones are patented headphones for xbox® and playstation® consoles and pcs using waveguide technology which no other vendor can copy this makes them a unique product in the  billion dollar gaming marketplace unlike other headphones which have their speakers located in the ear cups psyko has five speakers positioned along the bridge of the headphone with a subwoofer located in each ear cup sound from the five speakers travels down either the front or back waveguide tubes to each ear waveguides naturally send sound to both ears to produce  surround sound with zero latency and instant positional awareness having listened to these headphones while playing a first shooter game at e i found the sound quality to be very realistic very crisp and the best sounding of all headsets i tried at the e show i think the sound quality actually improves the video game by immersing the gamer with clear sound and better directional audio the headphones seemed to make the game more alive i also really liked how the ear cups can pivot open to keep your ears cooler but also to hear others speak while gaming each headphone comes with a psyko amplifier with bass and volume controls the microphone is removable when not needed psyko headphones compete primarily with tritton nysemktmcz astro nasdaqskul and turtle beach pamt headphones all three of these competitors use processing and algorithms to deliver surround sound in contrast psyko uses waveguide technology to deliver true  surround sound at the same price point as the competition krankz™ wireless bluetooth® onear headphones the krankz™ wireless bluetooth® headphones provide high definition audio in a compact onear design krankz headphones can connect to any bluetooth® device such as most smart phones tablets and computers krankz are noticeably louder with more bass than competitors with overtheear designs krankz supports active noise cancellation has an estimated  hour battery life and a khz frequency response range when i tried on the krankz headphones at e i was impressed by the quality of the sound coming from such small speakers the highs were high and the bass was booming with a  msrp i think users would be hard pressed to find better audio quality at this price the controls are found on the outside of the right ear cup which allowed me to control the volume as well as to go forward or back to select songs from a playlist i also liked how the headphones fold compactly to save space and come with a carrying case when an incoming call is received on a smart phone the user can answer the phone while wearing krankz by pressing the center button on the side of the headphone and talk using a builtin microphone when the call ends the music plays again krankz headphones compete primarily with skullcandy beats sennheiser monster sms audio and others exeo is currently working on a higher end krankz maxx overtheear design zaaz™ a smartkb™ for smart tvs zaaz™ smart tv keyboards incorporates both irda and bluetooth® for use with smart tvs with a built in touch pad and one touch access keys zaaz uniquely provides access keys to go to commonly used websites like netflix amazon and facebook which no other smart tv keyboard provides to date the back lit keyboard is ¾ the size of a regular keyboard in addition to the one touch keys the ff keys are programmable which allow users to customize their keyboards realtors can customize their zaaz keyboard for real estate websites such as zillowcom truliacom openhouseoncom and realtorcom stock traders could customize their zaaz keyboard for yahoo finance etradecom fidelitycom or program keys to bring up individual stock quotes on their smart tv while a large number of vendors make smart tvs i believe samsung is the only vendor that provides a smart tv keyboard which works exclusively with samsung tvs in contrast the zaaz keyboard which supports both irda and bluetooth® is expected to work with most if not all smart tvs in the marketplace including samsungs smart tvs the zaaz keyboard works with smart tvs cable boxes media centers playstation® xbox® tablets smart phones and pcs i recently visited stores in my area such as best buy frys electronics and costco and none of these stores currently sell keyboards for all smart tvs today even though they offer a large variety of smart tvs marketplace exeos main competitors in the gaming headphone marketplace are tritton  acquired by mad catz interactive in  with m salesastro gaming  acquired by skullcandy in turtle beach systems  acquired by parametric sound corporation with estimated sales of over  million the music headphone marketplace is estimated to be  billion dollars with an  growth rate in  exeos main competitors in this market are skullcandy inc  does  million annually in headphone sales beats electronics llc  acquired by apple nasdaqaapl for  billion dollars in  sennheiser monster and sms audio  sell wireless onear and overtheear headphones apples purchase of beats may benefit exeo as some companies who currently offer beats products may look for alternative products whose sales do not improve apples bottom line smart tvs sales are estimated to exceed  million units in  with roughly  million us households owning a smart tv by the end of  sales are expected to hit  billion dollars by  exeo a strong longterm buy exeo entertainment inc has great products to address large multibillion dollar marketplaces this gives exeo a lot of upside potential psyko headphones are based on patented technology that no other headphone vendor can copy the pc psyko is currently available for sale with a console model available within  months the krankz headphones are available today with a higher end krankz maxx overtheear design under development the zaaz keyboard is the only known smart keyboard designed to work with most if not all smart tvs if this product were released today the zaaz keyboard would represent a milestone in the smart tv industry exeo wants to ramp up sales of the zaaz keyboard to  units annually with a  retail price this would be  million dollars in retail sales the company did not disclose wholesale pricing recent events in  exeo raised  in round  of funding in  exeo raised  million in round  funding on january   exeos s went into effect in february  exeo received its symbol exeo from finra and in may  exeo became dtc eligible on may   exeo signed a distribution agreement with global marketing partners that allows them to resell their products through speed commerce formally navarre this new alliance makes exeo products available through brick and mortar as well as online retailers throughout the united states scott amaral ceo of exeo entertainment inc said this agreement will allow us to reach our target demographic where they shop throughout the united states we expect that this agreement could potentially add between  to  to our gross sales over the course of the next  months the verdict the challenge for exeo will be generating enough capital to communicate their story with consumers and to finalize the development of future products the reason exeo went public was to attract institutional money to market their products if exeo can attract institutional money i think exeo will be a long term winner while the company was very cautious to not disclose any nonpublic financial data when i asked about margins at the e show i was told they range between  to  depending on which product is being sold these figures assume brick and mortar retail sales with the three products described in this article combined with three additional products under development i see the potential for  million in sales alone with a margin at  this would equate to  million in gross profits which is significantly more than what exeo is currently generating today i rate exeo as a strong longterm buy my rating is based on the quality of their current products and the multibillion dollar markets their products are sold to if this company can execute their plan successfully i would estimate their stock price currently at   to increase to  to  within the next several months trademarks psyko™ krankz™ zaaz™ and smartkb™ are trademarks of exeo entertainment incall other product names are trademarks of their respective holders risk disclosure investing in penny stocks involves substantial risk investors should be aware of these risks and should never invest funds that they are not willing to lose exeo entertainment inc has incurred significant losses during the rd phase and to date has not generated revenue the company is dependent on management and a loss of management could significantly impact the company exeo needs to secure additional capital to fund a well executed marketing campaign there can be no assurance that the company will realize these funds and operations could be scaled back substantially while the company has two products available for sale and theyve received overwhelmingly positive reviews there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient sales to become profitable exeo entertainment inc faces competition from well capitalized companies such as astro  tritton  and turtle beach  changing market conditions and consumer preferences could have a negative impact on the company author disclosure the author holds a long position in exeo entertainment pictures from  e psyko™ gaming headphones psyko™ converter box with volume and bass controls

impressed with the quality and how easy it was to setup and start using love these web review  april  i purchased several pairs of these headphones and sell them in japan everyone likes them a lot plus i mark them up and make money psyko audio the unfair advantage amazon certified purchase  may  hard to say anything but awesome things about this headset its done me wonders in causing other players in games to quit in fits of rage profanities curses and accusations of hacking seem to occur quite often especially when they think they are sneaking up on you from behind only for you to hear them coming turn around and then knife then in the chest before they realize it toms guide the best directional audio weve ever tested pc gamer an audio orgy in your ears  the result is positional

surround sound pc gaming headset review pcwizkids tech talk subscribers psyko pcv  pc gaming headset system tigerdirect subscribers psykowave™ technology engineered for gaming psykowave™ technology delivers the highest level of audio directionality and natural sound reproduction over any other  or  surround sound gaming headset this is achieved through a radical design departure from traditional surround sound headsets instead of using signal processing to simulate surround effects five speakers are placed in the bridge of the headphone each in a precise location to create the correct timing and level differences to both ears dual precisiontuned audio waveguides direct the sound from all speakers to flow past the front and rear of both ears creating the same audio environment that exists with a  room speaker system to complete the  surround sound experience subwoofers are placed in each ear cup to deliver the most dynamic audio gaming experience what makes psyko better  headphones are just not designed for surround sound they are not even designed to accurately handle stereo since left sounds are only played in the left ear and right sounds are only played in the right ear in normal room stereo both ears can hear every sound with a timing and volume difference between each ear competitors use dsp digital signal processing technologies attempt to compensate for the inherent limitations of headphones their challenge is that everyones ears are as unique as fingerprints and so are the sound signals each person uses to detect the direction of a sound however dsp solutions deliver the same signal to everyone it is like selling the same prescription of glasses to everyone in the world even though we all need our own prescription dsp methods are unable to accurately deliver all sound sources to both ears for proper directionality processing time so they delay the sound to the headphones and that reduces your reaction time and game performance psyko is the only technology that delivers the vital timing and volume difference to each ear to reproduce true surround sound so they sound natural to everyone with no latency psyko  headphones  exeo entertainment my

headphone offering differs from the competition in the method of surround sound delivery we will face competition from manufacturers with established channels of distribution mature capital structures and significantly larger marketing budgets well established gaming headphone manufacturers include turtle beach a private company tritton – a subsidiary of mad catz interactive mcz and astro gaming which is a subsidiary of skullcandy skul while other headphone manufacturers replicate  surround sound through digital signal processing dsp the psyko™ headphones use a patented method of sound delivery that doesn’t require the use of dsp management believes that the difference in audio quality is a major differentiating factor between our product offering and what is currently available on the market zaaz™ keyboard the majority of the competition in the bluetooth wireless keyboard arena is concentrated amongst a few wellknown companies such as logitech logi microsoft msft apple aapl and samsung ssnlf while management believes that only samsung makes keyboards specifically designed to interact with smart tvs and that their keyboards only work with certain samsung tvs there can be no assurance that other companies do not currently manufacture or plan to manufacture such units in the future any such companies that manufacture keyboards capable of connecting to a smart tv would further increase competition exeo entertainment inc intends on differentiating the zaaz™ keyboard through a set of features designed specifically for smart tv users the zaaz™ keyboard features a customized set of “one touch access keys” that allows users to access specific user defined features of the consumers smart tv examples include one touch access to the following netflix facebook hulu
