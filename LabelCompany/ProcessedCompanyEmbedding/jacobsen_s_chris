program in applied physics faculty member chemistry of life processes institute chris jacobsens research group is focused on developing new methods in xray microscopy and applying them to interesting problems in biology environmental science and materials science  using either diffractive optics like fresnel zone plates fabricated using electron beam lithography or lensless methods where iterative phase retrieval methods are used to reconstruct an image from a coherent diffraction pattern images with a spatial resolution of  nm or better can be obtained  in absorption contrast one can combine imaging with spectroscopy to study chemical speciation at the nanoscale or one can use fluorescence detection to study trace element distributions with partsperbillion sensitivity  we are also developing detectors and image reconstruction algorithms that can be used to obtain quantitative phase contrast images with hard x rays and thus put elemental distributions into their ultrastructural context and also go from measurements of content to measurements of concentration since concentration gradients drive chemical processes  finally we are interested in understanding the limitations that radiation damage presents to xray microscopy studies and in developing both cryo instrumentation and sample preparation methods to mitigate those limitations  these efforts require bright xray beams so we use synchrotron radiation sources at argonne lab berkeley lab and elsewhere  students in the group explore interesting problems in optical physics and in instrumentation and get to broaden their perspective by working with collaborators from other research fields like biology environmental science and materials science representative publications full list via orcid or researcherid

by his father who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture after a spell as an apprentice mason jacobsen was admitted to the architecture school at the royal danish academy of fine arts where from  to  he studied under kay fisker and kaj gottlob both leading architects and designers still a student in  jacobsen participated in the paris art deco fair exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes where he won a silver medal for a chair design on that trip he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of le corbusiers lesprit nouveau pavilion before leaving the academy jacobsen also travelled to germany where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of mies van der rohe and walter gropius their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project an art gallery which won him a gold medal after completing architecture school he first worked at city architect poul holsøes architectural practice in  in collaboration with flemming lassen he won a danish architects association competition for designing the house of the future which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in copenhagens forum it was a spiralshaped flatroofed house in glass and concrete incorporating a private garage a boathouse and a helicopter pad other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with readymade meals a dodge cabriolet coupé was parked in the garage there was a chris craft in the boathouse and an autogyro on the roof jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultramodern architect preworld war ii careeredit one of jacobsens lifeguard towers at bellevue beach the year after winning the house of the future award arne jacobsen set up his own office he designed the functionalist rothenborg house which he planned in every detail a characteristic of many of his later works soon afterwards he won a competition from gentofte municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in klampenborg on the øresund coast just north of copenhagen the various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in denmark further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the international modern style in  the first item the bellevue sea bath was completed jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic bluestriped lifeguard towers kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets season cards and even the uniforms of the employees the focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests still it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in

in their day these projects were described as the dream of the a modern lifestyle århus city hall despite considerable public opposition to his avantgarde style jacobsen went on to build stelling house on gammeltorv one of copenhagens most historic squares although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting it caused virulent protests in its day one newspaper wrote that jacobsen ought to be banned from architecture for life when together with erik møller he won a competition for the design of århus city hall it

important buildings it consists of three offset volumes world war ii exile and returnedit søholm i terraced houses klampenborg during world war ii scarcity of building materials and nazi racial laws against jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain in  due to his jewish background arne jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the nazis planned deportation of jewish danes to concentration camps along with other jewish danes and with the help of the danish resistance he fled denmark rowing a small boat across øresund to neighboring sweden where he would stay for the next two years his architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper when the war ended in  jacobsen returned to denmark and resumed his architectural career the country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay after some years jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the allehusene complex from  and his søholm terraced houses from  he embarked on a more experimental phase he moved into one of the søholm houses and lived there until his death rødovre town hall central staircase rødovre town hall built from  to  shows how well jacobsen combined the use of different materials sandstone two types of glass painted metalwork and stainless steel it is also noted for its central staircase suspended from the roof on orangered steel rods the sides are cut from  cm steel plate painted a dark grey the steps only a few millimeters thick are stainless steel with a rubber coating on the upper side for better grip the munkegaard school consists of pavilions connected by glass corridors arranged in a grid system around small courtyards it received considerable attention in international school circles and contributed to his growing international reputation large commissionsedit with the sas royal hotel built from  to  jacobsen was given the opportunity to design what has been called the worlds first designer hotel he designed everything from the building and its furniture and fittings to the ashtrays sold in the souvenir shop and the airport buses st catherines college oxford view from the west these larger assignments started to attract attention and commissions from abroad rødovre town hall secured him an invitation for his first competition in germany which was followed by a number of other german projects a delegation of oxford dons visited the sas hotel and the munkegård school in their search for an architect for st catherines college they were soon convinced he was the right choice for their important commission again jacobsen designed everything including the garden down to the choice of fish species for the pond the dining hall is notable for its cumberland slate floor the original college buildings received a grade i listing on  march  uncompleted worksedit when arne jacobsen died unexpectedly in  he had a number of large projects under way these included a new town hall in mainz germany the danish national bank and the royal danish embassy in london these projects were completed by dissingweitling a firm set up by his former key employees hans dissing and otto weitling furniture and product designedit drop egg and swan chairs designed by jacobsen for use in the sas royal hotel pictured in background today arne jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs however he believed he was first and foremost an architect according to scott poole a professor at virginia tech arne jacobsen never used the word designer notoriously disliking it his way into product design came through his interest in gesamtkunst and most of his designs which later became famous in their own right were created for architectural projects most of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer fritz hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in  while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with louis poulsen in spite of his success with his chair at the paris exhibition in  it was during the s that his interest in furniture design peaked a major source of inspiration stemmed from the bent plywood designs of charles and ray eames he was also influenced by the italian design historian ernesto rogers who had proclaimed that the design of every element was equally important from the spoon to the city which harmonized well with his own ideals no  chairs in the auditorium of the ny carlsberg glyptotek in copenhagen in  he created the ant chair for an extension of the novo pharmaceutical factory and in  came the seven series both matched modern needs perfectly being light compact and easily stackable two other successful chair designs the egg and the swan were created for the sas royal hotel which he also designed in  other designs were made for stelton a company founded by his foster son peter holmbl these include the now classic cylinda line stainless steel cocktail kit and tableware other interior design is a line of faucets and accessories for bathroom and kitchen created after he won a competition in  for his design of the national bank of denmark this classic design is still in production today by danish company vola style and legacyedit according to r craig miller author of design  what modern was jacobsen’s work is an important and original contribution both to modernism and to the specific place denmark and the scandinavian countries have in the modern movement and continues one might in fact argue that much of what the modern movement stands for would have been lost and simply forgotten if scandinavian designers and architects like arne jacobsen would not have added that humane element to it arne jacobsen is noted for his sense of proportion indeed he himself saw this as one of the main features of his work in an interview he said the proportion is exactly what makes the beautiful ancient egyptian temples  and if we look at some of the most admired buildings of the renaissance and baroque we notice that they were all wellproportioned here is the basic thing selected worksedit alléhusene housing gentofte  st catherines college oxfordundergraduate rooms and belltowerview from west danish

known for being the prop used to hide christine keelers nakedness in the iconic photograph of her taken by lewis morley in  morley just happened to use a chair that he had in the studio which turned out to have been a copy of jacobsens design since then number  chairs have been used for many similar portraits imitating the pose the seven has featured on the set of the bbc soap opera eastenders jacobsens flatware design with right and lefthanded spoons is used by stanley kubrick in his movie  a space odyssey it was selected for the film because of its futuristic appearance arne jacobsens

pins and snap fasteners his mother pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was painting floral motifs he first hoped to become a painter but was dissuaded by his father who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture after a spell as an apprentice mason jacobsen was admitted to the architecture school at the royal danish academy of fine arts where from  to  he studied under kay fisker and kaj gottlob both leading architects and designers still a student in  jacobsen participated in the paris art deco fair exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes where he won a silver medal for a chair design on that trip he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of le corbusiers lesprit nouveau pavilion before leaving the academy jacobsen also travelled to germany where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of mies van der rohe and walter gropius their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project an art gallery which won him a gold medal after completing architecture school he first worked at city architect poul holsøes architectural practice in  in collaboration with flemming lassen he won a danish architects association competition for designing the house of the future which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in copenhagens forum it was a spiralshaped flatroofed house in glass and concrete incorporating a private garage a boathouse and a helicopter pad other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with readymade meals a dodge cabriolet coupé was parked in the garage there was a chris craft in the boathouse and an autogyro on the roof jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultramodern architect preworld war ii careeredit one of jacobsens lifeguard towers at bellevue beach the year after winning the house of the future award arne jacobsen set up his own office he designed the functionalist rothenborg house which he planned in every detail a characteristic of many of his later works soon afterwards he won a competition from gentofte municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in klampenborg on the øresund coast just north of copenhagen the various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in denmark further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the international modern style in  the first item the bellevue sea bath was completed jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic bluestriped lifeguard towers kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets season cards and even the uniforms of the employees the focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests still it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre in  came the bellavista residential development built in concrete steel and glass with smooth surfaces and open floor planning free of any excesses or ornaments completing the white trilogy in  the bellevue theatre featured a retractable roof allowing openair performances these early works clearly show the influence of the white cubist architecture jacobsen had encountered in germany particularly at the weissenhof estate in stuttgart the cluster of white buildings at bellevue also includes the skovshoved filling station in their day these projects were described as the dream of the a modern lifestyle århus city hall despite considerable public opposition to his avantgarde style jacobsen went on to build stelling house on gammeltorv one of copenhagens most historic squares although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting it caused virulent protests in its day one newspaper wrote that jacobsen ought to be banned from architecture for life when together with erik møller he won a competition for the design of århus city hall it was with yet another controversial design it was deemed too modern and too antimonumental in the end jacobsen had to add a tower as well as marble cladding still it is considered one of his most important buildings it consists of three offset volumes world war ii exile and returnedit søholm i terraced houses klampenborg during world war ii scarcity of building materials and nazi racial laws against jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain in  due to his jewish background arne jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the nazis planned deportation of jewish danes to concentration camps along with other jewish danes and with the help of the danish resistance he fled denmark rowing a small boat across øresund to neighboring sweden where he would stay for the next two years his architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper when the war ended in  jacobsen returned to denmark and resumed his architectural career the country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay after some years jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the allehusene complex from  and his søholm terraced houses from  he embarked on a more experimental phase he moved into one of the søholm houses and lived there until

light at the end of the tunnel others are still waiting for signs of encouragement as the economy starts to turn have you staged your business for resurgence expansion and its eventual sale your efforts to tidy up your business house in this slow time may reap significant benefits as the markets and the economy move forward business records and policies are your organizational documents articles of organization or incorporation partnership agreement bylaws etc organized and accessible have you reviewed these documents lately to assure that they accurately reflect your current business and operations are your minutes of meetings of the board of directors and shareholders up to date do you have an uptodate employee handbook that sets forth your employment practices and policies including if applicable the “at will” employment of your workers spend some time reinforcing this legal framework for your business it is the foundation upon which you operate shareholders and partners have the interests of the owners of the business been properly documented for corporations stock certificates should be issued to each shareholder reflecting their interests in the business and a stock ledger should evidence the history of stock issuances and transfers and the currently outstanding shareholdings for limited liability companies the interests of the members should be set forth in a written operating agreement signed by all members for partnerships the arrangements among the partners should be memorialized in a written partnership agreement signed by each partner further if there are multiple owners of the business they should have a buysell agreement in place that provides for the orderly transition of the business if one of more of the owners suffers a disability or death or otherwise desires to withdraw from the business nothing can be more distracting to your focus on advancing your daytoday operations than the uncertainty of a potential business transition filing requirements all corporations and limited liability companies doing business in california are required to file periodic statements of information with the california secretary of state is your statement of information current filings are required annually from corporations and biennially from limited liability companies with interim amendments required for any information changes between filings failure to file statements on a timely basis may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and the suspension of the business’s right to do business within the state for entities that are organized outside california those entities are required first to register with the secretary of state in order to qualify to do business within the state do you operate your business under an assumed name if so you must file a fictitious business name statement with the county clerk and renew that statement every five years many cities outside santa clarita require that companies obtain and annually renew business licenses in order to do business within their boundaries—have you checked the jurisdictions in which you are currently operating to assure that you have the required business licenses stock limited partnership interests and with some exceptions llc membership interests issued or sold in california are securities and are required to be qualified

practices liability insurance slow times in business are not all bad while your revenues may be down you can still profit from this time take the opportunity to tune up your business and have it ready to perform in the resurgence of the economy close new llc statute in the works close new llc statute in the works by chris s jacobsen limited liability companies “llcs” now seem like they have always been around however it was only in  that california adopted the beverlykillea limited liability company act which recognized these entities in california around that time nearly every other state also adopted statutes recognizing llcs with widely varying provisions much has changed since that time and in keeping with those changes sb  has been introduced in the california legislature to enact the revised uniform limited liability company act the “revised act” at the time of the initial recognition of llcs their classification for federal tax purposes was uncertain—tax regulations generally classified unincorporated associations as corporations not partnerships and singlemember llcs just did not seem to have any fit in the regulations a few years later the internal revenue service adopted the “checkthebox” regulations which removed the uncertainties of classification generally allowing partnership or disregarded entity treatment for all llcs unless an llc makes an affirmative election to be taxed as a corporation singlemember llcs are now popular for sole proprietorships as well as corporate subsidiaries the revised act is based on the revised uniform limited liability company act the “uniform act” adopted by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws with modifications to continue in effect certain aspects of existing california law the intent of the uniform act is to replace the varying llc statutes in each state including california’s beverlykillea limited liability company act with uniform provisions to enable llcs to more easily operate on a multistate basis as such the revised act moves california llc statutes toward national uniformity sets forth a more robust set of default rules that apply to topics on which the llc operating agreement is silent but preserves unique california provisions such as dissenters’ rights section  et seq and the prohibition on professional llcs provisions of note in the revised act include the following • the operating agreement the foundational contract among the llc’s owners is authorized to be in a record ie information on any medium that is retrievable in perceivable form implied written or oral or any combination section s• the operating agreement may alter or eliminate aspects of fiduciary duty andor limit the liability of members or managers for money damages arising from any breach of duty section  the right of a member to dissociate from the llc and its consequences are specifically recognized by the revised act section  et seqas currently proposed the revised act is to become operative on january   as of june   the revised act has been approved by the california senate and is currently being considered in the assembly judiciary committee time will tell how quickly the assembly acts on sb  stay tuned for further developments close california’s new corporations close california’s new corporations by chris s jacobsen two new forms of entities joined the california business landscape on january  —the benefit corporation and the flexible purpose corporation traditional corporations are organized to pursue profits while nonprofit corporations are organized to pursue public charitable or social benefits the two new corporate forms are intended to allow business operators and their investors to pursue both profits and public benefits however benefit corporations and flexible purpose corporations take different routes to accomplish those purposes benefit corporations have been adopted in several states including hawaii maryland new jersey new york vermont and virginia under similar legislation developed by b lab wwwbcorporationnet an organization that promotes and certifies benefit corporations in california benefit corporations are governed by new part  of title  division  of the california corporations code section  and following a benefit corporation is formed for the purpose of creating general public benefit ie a material positive impact on society and the environment taken as a whole or for one or more specific public benefits the articles of incorporation of a benefit corporation must include the statement “this corporation is a benefit corporation” and a provision identifying any specific public benefit purposes specific public benefit purposes may be added amended or deleted from time to time by amendment to the articles of incorporation existing corporations may also elect to become benefit corporations by amending their articles of incorporation to meet these requirements however such an amendment must be approved by at least a twothirds vote of the shareholders of each class or series of outstanding shares of the corporation to ensure accountability of the benefit corporation in pursuing its public benefit purpose the corporation is required to prepare an annual benefit report setting forth the ways in which the corporation pursued its general and specific public purposes and whether the corporation succeeded in pursuing those purposes as measured against an independent thirdparty standard the annual report must also identify each person that owns five percent or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation b lab has developed such a thirdparty standard and offers its certification services at fees of several thousand dollars per year copies of each report are required to be delivered to each shareholder and are to be made publicly available by posting on the corporation’s website or if it does not have a website by making copies available upon request special benefit enforcement proceedings may be commenced to enforce the corporation’s pursuit of its public benefit purposes flexible purpose corporations are established pursuant to the corporate flexibility act of  california corporations code section  and following this legislation is unique to california and is the result of the collaboration of a group of corporate attorneys from major california law firms who sought to create a flexible form of corporation which could devise its own mix of economic and social objectives the articles of incorporation of a flexible purpose corporation must include among other matters a statement that it “is organized as a flexible purpose corporation under the corporate flexibility act of ” a corporate name that includes the words “flexible purpose corporation” or an abbreviation thereof as “fpc” and a statement that in addition to engaging in any other lawful activities a purpose of the corporation is to engage in one or more of the following charitable and public purpose activities that could be carried out by a nonprofit public benefit corporation or promoting positive shortterm or longterm effects or minimizing adverse shortterm or longterm effects of the corporation’s activities on its employees suppliers customers creditors the community and society andor the environment the special purpose of the corporation may be changed by amendment of its articles of incorporation that has been approved by at least a twothirds vote of each class of outstanding shares of the corporation directors and officers of a flexible purpose corporation are required to specify objectives for measuring the impact of the corporation’s efforts relating to its special purpose and to include a management discussion and analysis “mda” of those efforts in its annual reports unlike benefit corporations flexible purpose corporations are not required to measure their efforts against an independent thirdparty standard the flexible purpose corporations are also required to the extent consistent with reasonable confidentiality requirements to make the mda available to the public by posting on its website or providing it through similar electronic means how each of these corporate forms will be embraced by california businesses and investors remains to be seen which form of organization to choose will require casebycase consideration of the organization’s intended purposes and operations and formation activities will no doubt take more time and effort than traditional forprofit corporations especially as legal practitioners will take some time to become familiar with the new requirements of these corporations the benefit corporation offers the advantage of its use and recognition in other jurisdictions while the flexible purpose corporation offers greater flexibility in determining the special purposes to be pursued and less onerous governance requirements close new laws against fraudulent solicitations close new laws against fraudulent solicitations by chris s jacobsen have you received an officiallooking form seeking your company’s compliance with a governmental requirement for a

jacobsen are new forms of corporations in californias future two bills are currently wending their ways through the california legislature that would allow forprofit corporations to expand their primary mandate of earning profits for shareholders to also include the pursuit of charitable and public purposes the bills are ab  and sb  each of which takes a different approach to this expansion ab  huffman would create a new form of corporate entity to be known as a benefit corporation a benefit corporation could be formed for the purpose of creating general public benefit ie a material positive impact on society and the environment taken as a whole or it could identify specific public benefits as an additional purpose of the corporation specific purposes might include providing lowincome or underserved individuals or communities with beneficial products or services promoting economic opportunity for individuals or communities beyond the creation of jobs in the ordinary course of business preserving the environment and improving human health the bill would also alter the general duties of the corporations directors to the corporation and its shareholders so that when the directors consider any proposed action of the corporation they would also be required to consider the potential impact of the action on among others employees customers who are beneficiaries of the general or specific benefit purposes and the environment the corporation would also be required to prepare an annual benefit report setting forth the ways in which the corporation pursued its general and specific public purposes and whether the corporation succeeded in pursuing those purposes as measured against an independent thirdparty standard copies of each report would be filed with the secretary of state special benefit enforcement proceedings would also be established as the vehicle to enforce the corporations pursuit of its public benefit purposes sb  desaulnier would create a
