unique business model and the performance over the last couple of years as well as our view on each of the lines of businesses that we are involved in both talking about expectations and challenges of each of those so talking about our performance we are really pleased to report another record quarter to you first quarter as you know first quarter  net income to common shareholders was  million thats up about  over first quarter  our diluted earnings per share were  thats up  for over first quarter  our first quarter net income to common shareholders from continuing operations as you know bankmobile is not  is a discontinued operation so if you take that out our net income to common shareholders was  million and thats up about  over last year and our return on average assets for first quarter  was  percent and our return on average common equity was  were pleased that that puts us among the top quartile of banks in the united states and the pretax preprovision return on assets and return on average common equity for first quarter was  and  respectively our book value per common share was  at march  and thats up  over march   from a capital point of view weve been very focused on it as we get ready to cross the  billion mark so im pleased to share with you that out capital ratios were  to estimated total risk based capital  tier  leverage and  tangible common equity to average tangible assets from an overall business point of view total loans were up little over  to  billion or  billion at march   and total deposits were up about  percent to  billion over in last year and our first quarter efficiency ratio from the continuing operations was  and thats a pretty significant improvement of about  percentage points over the same period last year and so with that id like to hand it over to bob to go over some details of the financials robert wahlman okay thank you very much jay and good afternoon everyone as noted by jay and as described in our first quarter  earnings release customer is just reporting gross assets of  billion which is up  million from march   and up  million since december   so quarter ago q  earnings per common share was  per share which compares to q  earnings per common share of  in q  earnings per common share of  so all earnings metrics our customers are very positive from q  im going to take just a moment to put a few of the key ratios in the context and jay has referred to these so im going to put in a little different context customer set out  years ago or set customer or set targets  years or more ago that they wanted to hit from some of these earnings metrics and that is the return on average assets of  was set and return on average common equity of  was established and a target with efficiency ratio in the low forties was that many of you who have been following us for  years perhaps remember though i just want to compare those to where we are now just  years later when we do our reporting and return on average assets of  return on common equity  and efficiency ratio the local forties so we have exceeded those targets and we are of course setting new targets that were going to work very hard for our shareholders to achieve a second set of key ratios that many investors have talked to myself and talk to jay about as we met with them over the past couple years where our regulatory capital ratios that are capital ratio in general there was some concern out there for the investor community that the capital ratios were too low and therefore they were what was placed into the stock was there would be a dilutive capital raise during  i want to emphasize a couple of things here during  customers increased its capital by over  so over  million while diluting common shares only around  this was accomplished by retaining our earnings a common stock raise and preferred stock races but set our capital ratios at levels significantly in excess of the well capitalized levels which includes total risk based capital at  tier  risk based capital  and cep one ratio at  and leverage ratio at  and as jay just noted a minute ago we have reached those targets for all of our capital ratios with the exception of cep one when we view some preferred stock instead of common stock in our capital stack a little bit different but it still provides the capital needed so we are hitting the capital ratios and these are very strong ratios and very close to the midpoint of our peer banks industry peer groups so i just want to emphasize that as it raises the capital so the third key item here is we do watch our asset quality very carefully and are very proud of maintaining the strong asset quality that we have in customers tier    npls were only  basis points all up a bit best for some isolated credit issues on individual loans it is in fact much lower than our peer group and much lower than the industry nonperforming loans taken as a whole we have not compromised our underwriting standards and were committed to not compromising our underwriting standards as we go forward and look for strong asset quality so these actions taken as well as many of the other actions taken apparently has positioned customers for a good strong run of sustainable earnings let me walk you through the significant events as caption the income statement and discuss the other drivers of the performance net interest income from q  was  million compared to  million in q  and  million in q  average loan balances were higher in q  compared to q  up  billion and that drives most of the increase and those numbers and they could have been higher except we have worked very hard on in q  to keep our assets under  billion so the loan volume is good and that has driven the rate increases i mean them arm net interest income increases regarding interest rates customers reported a net interest margin of  in q  compared to  in q  and in q  the net interest margin declined during q  compared to q  is really attributable to  key matters the decline in the outstanding balances of the warehouse portfolio down in q average balances approximately  million from q and down  million for  as we have talked about in the past that is a business that is very much seasonal with lower volumes during the winter months as residential mortgage loan originations are lower in customer funds a significant portion of that portfolio using low cost overnight funds because of the short term duration of the asset and that provides us a very strong net interest margin and then there is the second element is to deliver the fact of falling margins on investment portfolio and cash in the federal reserve on dialysis which were up about a combined  million so you had a decrease in higher margin assets in an increase in some lower margin asset so as a result of this shift in the use of funds customers interest income declined by approximately  million compared to q  which reduce the yield on these earning assets by approximately  basis points however as we look forward to q and q we do expect the mortgage warehouse loan balances to recover following the seasonal reduction in the volume that we experienced in q and assuming we sell or manage the purchase investment securities portfolio to fund that growth we should see the nim increase back to more traditional levels in q  noninterest income from continuing operations for q  was  million and excluding the impairment on the religare security noninterest income was  million this is a good number and its up from noninterest income for q  up  million a  million increase the increase in noninterest income results from greater gains on sales of loans in the sba business ill compare to the past a year ago as we grew that business over the past year and then in the first quarter  customers did sell approximately  million of multifamily loans in this period for a  million gain and then there is the swap premiums on market derivatives that are included in this item for about  million as has been described in our securities filings on several occasions customers operating expenses have been increasing in general as customers bank grew due to the additional resources needed of all types to run the larger banking business so we needed more employees we needed more space to occupy we needed more technology professional services in fact because the bank was bigger and became more complex however in q  what we saw is that as asset growth has moderated and as we work to stay under  billion for now operating expenses actually decreased to  million from continuing operations now thats a decrease of  million from q  and a decrease of  from q  so it seems that we have had some consistent decreases in our core banking costs over the course of the last year correspondingly our efficiency ratio from continuing operations has declined to  there are increases and decreases embedded in a different expense light but the overall trend is for operating expenses continue operations to that growth to moderate at the level of asset growth is moderated and expense control has been an area of management focus as the bank has grown in particularly during the first quarter regarding income taxes customers estimated income tax rate that we use for federal state and local is  however in q  customer recorded tax benefits related to the vesting of restricted shares an exercise of options of  million and thats following the gaap accounting rules and we talked about that extensively last quarter when we adopted asc  and then customers also recorded a  million deferred tax assets at this period on which offsets the bottom which relates to the  million of impairment charges recognized by customers related to our equity investment in religare enterprises you may recall that in the fourth quarter we recorded a  million impairment charge in this court and we did not take any tax benefit at that point in time because of the rules that would allow us to do so which would mean that they have a executable tax strategy that was prudent and reasonable during  customers developed those tax strategies and obtained clarity around our ability to execute those strategies that allow customers to realize the tax benefit on the full set of impairment losses  million to the tax benefit relates the q  impairment recognition and then  million of this related to the impairment recognized in q that we could not recognize until we had a prudent strategy in place just turning for a moment quickly to the bankmobile business segment in q  the bankmobile business segment which is reported as a discontinued operations in our consolidated income statement reported a net loss after taxes of  million compared to a net loss of  million in q  and a net loss of  million in q  the q  result did not include the student loan proceeds so i dont think is a reasonable comparison but the q numbers both and the q numbers both include the operating results of the disbursement business the improvement in the gaap operating results in q  compared to fourth quarter of last year is due to receipt of the students of their monies on their refund in january and then having that spend for  months whereas in the third quarter the monies were received in august and september and we did not have its highest spend in those  months and of course this business is driven by the interchange income thats received on that spend its important to note here that one we are growing that business and it is a scale business but secondly that the gaap results that i just talked about in this paragraph are not reflective of what the business earnings are that the business would earn if it was a standalone entity or even what the business earnings would be and managements internal reporting the gaap earnings does not give the business segment any credit for generating over  million in deposit which are then used to fund balances loan balances across the bank we do provide statement reporting it is in the earnings release and it is in the investor presentation an honest statement reporting faces customer calculate that business contributed  million to customers after tax net income for the period and thats assuming funds transfer pricing equal to about  on those deposit balances and bankmobile was an independent company the business could directly invest in debt securities or loans that would have even a higher yield than the  that we allocate to them so in summary jay i believe that customer has a very strong start  a very positive start in that barring any unforeseen surprises we will enjoy record earnings for  back to you jay sidhu thank you bob we view this period as a very sort of like a milestone because as youve seen and you heard from bob that customers bancorps total asset is worth  billion at march  so you should expect us to cross the  billion mark whether it happens at second quarter or third quarter but its going to happen so we see a tremendous amount of growth in our pipeline and customers is well positioned to do that so as part of that strategy we are very well prepared and have been involved for the last  to  months for the  billion category and we are we believe that all the gaap analysis and the strategies that weve developed show us that we are very well prepared for that and so we believe that we will not be a dpast compliant company till  however we believe that there is a pretty good chance that he might be doing a drive sort of a run for dpast either at end of this year or in the middle of next year so that by  its a very smooth movement from being a below  billion bank to above  billion bank as many of you may know it was about  years ago that customers bancorp was formed and we started off as though extremely troubled rs million asset company and now here we have reached a milestone of the  billion as a company and we have done it principally all from as a result of organic growth so what has been our strategy so we have been a very highly focused innovative relationship banking based commercial bank a business bank thats been focused on strong organic growth focused on effectively utilizing our capital focused on good resource allocation and a branch like model and operating in attractive markets as you know our markets have been boston through philadelphia along interstate  and weve done that also with a very robust risk management driven business strategy about whats been our model and consistently for the last  years since we were a troubled  billion bank that needs some of us personally invested in to take it to  plus marketcap company today the number one has been what we call the unique single point of contact model what that is high tech high touch model with a very very few bank branches dominance in few product lines and supplemented with very experienced leadership teams at school throughout the market franchise and having a style that is extremely innovative and do some would call it disruptive to the traditional banking style while through our robust risk management infrastructure having a strong asset quality and a strong focus on other types of risks and then hence resulting in creating a high growth company with superior performance what have we created in the last  years besides higher assets weve created a company where the total revenues just  years ago were  million and today there are  last year there were  million and the growth that we experienced we took pause button on that since june  last year and we feel that we are positioned to take our foot off the pause button because it was prudent for us to build our infrastructure get ready for the  billion get our capital in places get our systems and processes in place and so we expect you should expect us to continue with our growth strategy and these revenues have grown at an act compounded annual growth rate of  percent over the last  years and go we that gay men pro as a result of organic growth and to and we expect to see you should expect to see the similar growth in terms of dollars of business coming into us our net income over the last  years we were making the only  million in  thats all we made our net income as you know was over  million last year and it was  million just from the content when you take out all sorts of unusual items this quarter our net interest income has grown over the same period kind this is  years from  million in  to  million in  and at the same time while our net interest income from like i mentioned to you from  million to  million our expensive grew only from  million to  million that is the reason why our efficiency ratio which was about   years ago is today down to  from a deposit growth point of view you know the numbers for this year our total deposits five years ago were only  billion our dd is  years ago but only  million our cost of departed  years ago was  percent our average deposits for branch  years ago was  million compared to about  million today so thats what we mean by our branch life model this single point of contact model has been very effective for us in executing our strategy today banking the privately held businesses those commercial loans make up  percent of our portfolio banking the high network families thats our result of product dominance which are some of you call them multifamily loans theyll make up  percent of our portfolio commercial real estate which is the main driver for most community banks in the united states only makes up  of our portfolio so our total loan growth has been  over this  year period some may regard this is  cagr over this  year period some may regard this to be significantly above average growth hence you may say that many times comes with problems so let me share with you the nonperforming asset trends which im sure many of you are aware of today our nonperforming loans are   years ago they were  so theres a consistency of performance with continued gradual improvement now talking about our different lines of businesses cni lending is our most important line of business and weve broken that down into privately held businesses in our own geographic market and privately held mortgage companies throughout the nation so our businesses are going for the private banking business we are between boston and philadelphia and banking the mortgage companies are all over the country we are targeting  million in annual revenues and less single point of contact businesses and weve supplement that with the sba business which is also regional in nature to serve these small and medium sized businesses from banking the high net worth families that is only a regional business for with about  of the business coming from new york city and that to us is an approach that weve taken very very prudent approach over here and we believe that we have a very strong credit quality in this niche and that is run by people with over  years of average experience in this line of business one can say from the start weve had a strategy of running a company with strong credit quality and making up the lower margin through much better efficiencies so our total cost of the percentage of assets  years ago were  today they are  so that is the difference where the average bank is still spending between  to  to run their companies by spending only  which is our number at march  to run the company we can produce the same kind of results that you would expect from companies with  margin to produce with only a  to  margin and where is in our opinion a much more sustainable model as the result of all this our book value over the last  years has gone up by  compounded and cut the shareholders over the last  years have seen their equity go up by  percent compared to less than  for the kbw regional index so let me share with you where do we sit today and how do we plan to cross the  billion mark we are going to remain focused on the lines of businesses that have taken our company from  million problem bank to  billion high performing bank and that is not going to change our business strategy is clear its working we will not deviate from what critical success factors so preview credit quality focusing on recruitment and retention of high performing teams and staying with our business strategy so we believe that the model thats working for us in boston and providence in new york and philadelphia can be repeated in other market areas so over the next couple of years what you should expect us to do is to look at markets like neighboring markets like washington dc market like chicago and the light and not be surprised if we enter those markets as a business bank with private banking type of keeps our focus will remain the same which is superior credit quality and the niches will be the same which are small medium sized businesses below the  million in revenue and our revenue does it will be made up of just net interest income about coming out of low cost deposits as well as consistency of performance and manager of risks at the same time so cni business you should expect that to continue to grow for us arab but it at a clip of somewhere between  million to  million or  million a year as we cross but that business and thats good thats good other targets we set for ourselves regarding multifamily over the last couple of years we have been looking at consistently almost consistently selling a portion of our production we did it again last quarter by creating liquidity and originating a lot of the business so we will continue to do it that way but multifamily loans will be a significant part of our business but we dont believe its going to be significantly in excess of  of our balance sheet as far as commercial real estate is concerned that is not very significant but that we defined as nonowner occupied commercial real estate we think that is the highest risk business and we will continue to focus because of the volatility of that business well continue to focus on very selected niches in that area banking the mortgage companies even though its extremely volatile business but we are balancing it like you saw in the first quarter by either looking at investing some of those assets in multifamily businesses or investment securities or be willing to take a hit to our margin temporary it to our margin and making it up to operating efficiencies since our strategy for the last  quarters has been to remain below  billion weve been very focused on improving our operating efficiencies and thats why you saw a flat expense by design so you should expect our expenses to go up because we need to invest in the infrastructure as we continue to build our company but the efficiency ratios should continue to improve we wont be satisfied until we get to the high thirties in terms of the efficiency ratio so with that id like to now ask tom to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions well take our first question joseph gladue congratulations this is joe gladue from merion capital group jay sidhu hi joe robert wahlman hi joe joseph gladue i just wanted to touch base just a little bit on the net interest margin you had i guess on the cost side i guess there was a significant increase in federal home loan bank borrowings just wondering whats the duration and cost of those relative to i guess the cost of interest bearing liabilities youve had robert wahlman joe one thing that we did that increased the well let me put it this way when the balances come down on the federal home loan bank borrowing were paying off the short duration assets and so that leaves short duration liabilities which leads the longer duration liabilities in place and so as we bring down the  as the balances come down and we pay down the shorter duration the average cost goes up in addition to that when we did the investment securities weve borrowed the monies to fund those with a bit longer duration that we would normally do close to two years and so that also provided some additional cost of borrowing so its a function of not so much what we did just that in terms of layering on higher cost borrowing so much as it is we pay off a lot of short term borrowings which then raise the average cost joseph gladue alright i just wanted to be sure if i heard you correctly you said that  is still a good tax rate to use going forward just want to be sure the tax strategies you used in the first quarter wont have any real impact going forward is that correct robert wahlman joe the  is the basis where to start from but then you are going to have the effects of the accounting standards that became effective at the beginning of this year we early adopted in the fourth quarter of last year and thats going to consistently have an effect on the effective tax rate going forward i believe its part of the core operations i think theres some discussion on that last quarter with them and amongst them joseph gladue okay alright and just i guess jay touched a little bit on the new team hires but just wondering its been a little tougher to add teams while youre trying to stay below  billion but just wondering if you have a good pipeline ready to go now unleash the balance sheet jay sidhu joe yes we are constantly looking at recruiting teams and both within our existing market and for the longer haul outside our existing markets in those geographic markets that i just shared with you which is washington dc and chicago and to be our positioned within the next six months or so that we will bring him on board joseph gladue alright thank you operator and well take our next question mike pareto hi good afternoon mike pareto from kbw robert wahlman hi mike how are you mike pareto good thanks jay i know you were probably limited to what you said but i thought i had to ask just any update on the bankmobile sale process that you can give us jay sidhu i think mike its everything is on target based upon what we have said and we expect the bankmobile divestiture to be completed this year subject to regulatory approval so all i can say is that if there are any more updates we will appropriately put them out immediately mike pareto okay i have a couple of questions around deposit and  billion i guess first of do you guys know you look at this kind of the geographic break out of your deposit base defense today i mean do you have an idea of how many your deposits are kind of more in the legacy philly markets versus the boston new york and downtown philly of the world jay sidhu mike we have bank branches the legacy bank branches in the pennsylvania market the legacy philadelphia market so our retail and business banking operations are producing about   of the deposits are right here in this market the other  which includes new york principally are coming out of our private banking offices principally new york and we have about  million of deposits out of the new england and so the  but the new york market has been the best market for us together with others mike pareto and as you kind of move to grow past  billion i mean organically here can you talk about the funding strategy a little bit i mean when you go into these newer markets like dc chicago you are going to lead with some price and attract that way or how do you guys expect to kind of grow the deposit base as we go here losing the obviously at some point this year the bankmobile noninterest bearing deposits which you guys have made the use of over the last couple of years jay sidhu our strategy is been to recruit teams are not made up of just lenders but to recruit teams as we call them made up of bankers and this would be teams of private bankers who are already managing a portfolio of deposits so the billion plus deposits that weve gotten in new york in the last few quarters that came in through teams that we recruited including  teams from signature bank so thats how we intend to grow the teams we are recruiting first will be a liability base team who can get deposits in for us and that will be followed by supplementing them by teams who will generate assets for us our model of profitability and for creating the incentive compensation for our teams is very much based on much higher compensation if you can get selffund yourself and generate those deposits and the lower cost deposits like ddas and noninterest bearing all interest bearing are the most common in terms of affecting your profitability of those teams and you can have very profitable and extremely high incentive compensation plans even if you dont generate a single loan we have earning asset which are all across our region but the funding capabilities are the most important so its a funding driven strategy or a liability driven strategy that we will be pursuing as we expand our franchise so we intend to get deposit we intend to have a deposit gathering  in each of the market so that right now we are operating without  but will be converting many of those delta goes into deposit generating branches so that is a strategy that will replace some of the if not all of the deposits that we are testing through the bankmobile sale and to our own franchise we didnt see a need to do that but now we will replace all anecdote principally the dda area and the other low cost area and we are highly confident of replacing those deposits that will be lost through the bankmobile divestiture mike pareto and you expect any increase in expenses as it relates to trying to kind of market the brand some of these newer markets i mean dc is obviously in the northeast corridor here but market like chicago obviously theres quite a few other business banks would do longer establishment market there do you expect that to spent some money to get the name out there or how are you guys thinking about that as you know potentially newer markets robert wahlman mike have you seen any customers bank in new york mike pareto yes but new york is much more you guys have been in the market longer much more densely populated you guys have hired team there is going to be any different approach or anything thats worth noting as you kind of got into different markets versus new york which is pretty unique market jay sidhu mike people in chicago think theyre more unique than new york so our strategy is going to be the same we are not a retail bank we are not going to be doing the typical marketing that youd expect from retail or traditional banks our marketing will be much more of the signature bank type yes there will be some contributions or some involvement with the business community and the charitable community in each of those markets but no if you think we will be doing billboards or newspapers or television in these markets is that would be a wrong assumption on your part we do a  for each of those markets that we are entering and our goal is that within one year we will be making up any of those startup expenses and there will be profit mike pareto okay jay sidhu okay and then there is a growth rate that is our business model so as we develop that mike we will be sharing with a little bit more details with you that i can understand very much that you would want to see that sort of transparency but i just want wanted to go over the last  years because  years ago we were asked the question how can you generate loans and deposits in new york just like youre telling me now new york is different you guys are known guess what we werent known at all in new york we had a reception for our private banking clients we had  people show up at  park avenue and those were the whoswho in new york city same thing goes on in boston and providence it will take us a while    years but i would expect you to ask a question chicago it was easy for you but how is xyz city will be for you mike pareto okay thanks its a fair point i just curious because obviously every market is a little different and was wondering if you had any different agenda as you approach some of these new markets so appreciate your time thanks operator and well take our next question robert haderer good evening guys this is actually rob haderer filling in for frank schiraldi here at sandler jay sidhu hello bob robert haderer first i wanted to just sort of dive into the asset sensitivity position you talk about the past your active sensitivity position i guess is that contingent here on the warehouse down is bouncing back like weve seen in prior second quarters in that kind of  to  range here and secondly what kind of deposit status do you assume in the asset sensitivity assumption robert wahlman okay im looking for the page in the investor deck there is a page in this investor deck where we do show if you want to take a look at that there is a  basis point increase and  basis increase jay sidhu so at march  with a  basis point increase using our simulation model you should expect our net interest income to go up by  last year at the same time that would have gone up by  and  i am sorry this is about the  basis points for the  basis points it will go up by  and last year at this time they would have gone up by  so we are much more asset sensitive today then where at march  of  and this net interest income simulation is based upon the asset liability model and it assumes flat balance sheet with no volume increases or decline and no strategies other than simply running a simple tradition model and that is the only way that you can compare apples with apples so even though you are so right mortgage warehouse business does affect the sensitivity but at the same time we extended our liabilities to dramatically reduce the risks of interest  sensitivity for us and make us more sense to today during a time period when we expect that the rates might be going down robert wahlman and in regards the betas obviously the betas that we use to send upon the particular product and we do have some variation within them but i think the overall beta is about  and obviously we do have some products were doing that or maybe a little bit more but there are other products who we havent moved yet at this point in time despite having  interest rate increases robert haderer great thats very helpful so i guess in theory q plays out where you have a bounce back in the mortgage warehouse business in a mix shift sort of out of the securities portfolio back into the higher margin business in theory at least your asset sensitivity position should increase from the number disclosed in the deck as of  is that a fair assumption robert wahlman but do remember that our overall objective is to manage ourselves relatively neutral were not looking to position ourselves for interest rate increases or decreases but to me remain relatively neutral because were not betting on which thats not a business to estimate it i am too bad as to which way their interest rates are moving we do try to maintain ourselves relatively new neutral and tend to our business of banking and i think you but im sure youre aware of this but about  of our cni loans are immediately of valuable rate  of our banking to mortgage company loans that you refer to them as mortgage warehouse or variable rate and you didnt notice that in spite of the  basis points that moves over the last couple of quarters yes you see that we have moved our deposit and we are noticing banks simply shrinking and not passing on any other rate increases that should also give you the comfort level that why our deposit business is continuing to grow because we are managing our company in a neutral basis we are not dependent on continuing to improve our profitability just by not passing on to higher rate to deposit robert haderer thats helpful color also wanted to ask about credit clearly nonperformers are still at a very low level here which is good i didnt notice about a  million uptake in cni nonperforming loans was wondering about any color there in terms of when those originated size type of industry any sort of color on the uptake in nonperformers would be helpful jay sidhu yes sure there were basically three loans two of them are sba guaranteed loans and one of them was not in that situation it was all about a business model its amazing when you are bankers make credit decision the last thing we worry about is the impact of technology on your business and right now it is the number two item in our assessing whether we should extend credit to a small medium sized business is there impact of the changing technology consumer trends on that business thats the number two fact to be considered so those all those three credit problem of loans we believe that they have been resolved but thats not to say others wont come in we are in the risk taking business but our belief is that the kind of business we are running you should expect us to have about  basis points nonperforming loans on a sustainable basis robert haderer got you and one last one for me you gave a lot of good color on potential new markets i know its not been your mo in the past but market like chicago and noncontiguous market would you consider ma to enter those markets or not jay sidhu my model is organic growth so i will never say never but we are not focused on ma we are focused on tangible book value growth not justifying a  year payback on tangible book value dilution we believe that we are extremely attractively valued at only  times earnings and  of book value where we are trading right now it makes a whole lot of sense for us to continue doing what weve done because thats resulted even though we are attracted the price thats resulted in way above average accounts but our shareholders so the model thats worked for us in the past we believe is the model we stick with and continue with our organic growth and just be extremely optimistic if we see for an opportunity for an ma but ma is not our prime strategy robert haderer got it and to go back to the credit real quick sorry to jump around you mentioned one of the credit the company being negatively impacted by technology is that a technology company itself or is it a different industry jay sidhu no its in the different industry robert haderer okay and i know you did allocate some specific reserves this quarter you mentioned you think that probably covers it you anticipate to working out those credit yourself or do you think those credits get  way how do you think gets resolved jay sidhu those credits are  have been worked on robert haderer okay jay sidhu already operator well take our next question bill dezellem bill dezellem from tieton capital management jay sidhu hi bill bill dezellem wanted to followup on your expansion strategy jay what are your thoughts on the smaller cities say between chicago and the i corridor like a pittsburg or cincinnati any others like that jay sidhu i think we look at the dominance of large banks those are very attractive markets the ones that you are naming but to be able to recruit teams would bring a book of business with them its a whole lot easier if those teams right now are already have  million to  million portfolio the  deposits or loans that they are managing and that usually is a whole lot easier to identify in the larger markets and then you can recruit those teams and then our incentive compensation plan is very attractive because those are the teams who can see who in the past may have gotten into the noble banking and now the noble banking is not an option so we basically inset them in a way that come and join us our family and look at our existing teams and what are they doing and you are pretty much on a defined area where risk management is very clear that you cannot violate that but within that framework you are basically operating your own bank thats why we are focused more on the bigger markets right now but thats not to say that later on we will not focus on the next tier but there is so much of business in our opinion that was available in new york and in boston and less so in philadelphia to be honest with you in all of our key markets philadelphia is our smallest market and we probably see virginia dc maryland area is a very attractive market and we are already doing enough business in chicago to really take off from that because weve been operating out of our new york operations to serve chicago and we like that market and the disruptions in that market and we like the idea that there is ma activity taking place in that markets and maybe we can put up teams bill dezellem let me take that question and move south with it to what degree would you have an interest in a market like atlanta which is larger but may or may not be different from the market you currently operated jay sidhu at good time were only focused on the two markets that i shared with you but we will do loud atlanta but we got to take some baby steps and make sure that things are working well they are not perfect you know they are not execution so right now we want to limit it to about two new markets and for the next  to  months and make the learning from our mistakes im sure well make some and from this and after that look at the other markets and i think atlanta is on our list bill dezellem thank you for the perspective operator and there are no further questions left in the queue mr sidhu id like to turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks jay sidhu well thank you tom and thank you very much ladies and gentlemen

sidhu bankmobile usa  months ago interviews in every challenge there is huge opportunity what this kind of environment creates is an opportunity to develop a unique business model it’s when times are this tough is when we have the chance to think of new unique models bankmobile  one to watch… if you can keep up it was the pleasure of rfi group to meet recently with none other than jay sidhu – a man making more than a splash in the mobile banking world jay sidhu is chairman and ceo of bankmobile and customers bank a  billion asset bank headquartered in pennsylvania previous founder chairman and ceo of sovereign bancorp inc which jay grew from an ipo offering of  million to a market cap approaching  billion he has unsurprisingly received various recognitions in the industry including the financial world’s ceo of the year we were keen to talk to jay about not only what makes the man but what he sees as the true opportunities and challenges for the financial services industry over the horizon setting the scene he explains that with interest rates at an alltime low globally it is inevitable that margins will continue on the downward slope we are all experiencing revenue growth remains difficult and cost initiatives continue to be the main focus of the banking and financial services sector this is all overlayed with a strict regulatory environment with demanding compliance considerations and cautious risk management “regulators globally are demanding a reduction in fees charged by banks and with revenue growth challenged already this is doubling any pressure we are already facing it’s a very tough environment” so the silver lining… jay stipulates that in every challenge he sees huge opportunity “what this kind of environment creates is an opportunity to develop a unique business model it’s when times are this tough is when we have the chance to think of new unique models other opportunities i see are in the merger and acquisition space and also technology why not look at technology differently technology which can acquire and retain customers and create better experiences for our customer there’s also obviously the data analytics space rather than use data to simply manage tasks and provide product use it to meet unmet needs of your customers it’s in the things they haven’t even thought of  this is where we find the opportunities at bankmobile we are truly looking at the nontraditional approach said very simply banks need to create lower cost of debt and higher return on customer’s money” bankmobile as the name suggests sees vast opportunity in customers’ adoption of mobile technology according to jay’s no doubt highly researched sources an average customer in the us currently visits their bank branch about  times a year only  years ago this was up to  to  times a week the pace of change when spelt out is staggering “when someone wakes up what is the very first thing they do they grab their smart phone in a financial sense they want to catch up look at their personal finances and perhaps conduct a few transactions on a daily basis what they are doing on this device is ever increasing it is now truly integrated into every aspect of someone’s life and we see this as a huge huge opportunity to meet needs of customers and all their financial needs” bankmobile jay explains is not in the business of ‘selling a product’ and it’s on this premise he has passionately built his organisation’s model “we are in a business of making financing easier for customers and really all we want to do is to make them love their bank customers see banking as a nuisance and we see this exact attitude as an opportunity with absolutely no branches we strive to offer an awesome experience” when looking to innovative offerings like that of bankmobile we thought it pertinent to ask jay where he sees the best types of innovation coming from and importantly how is it achieved “partnerships is the word that comes to mind i really think you can’t do it all yourself it’s in the using of partnerships that really creates the most awesome experiences banking is used to facilitate a need like airbnb is to facilitate a place to stay and uber how to get there a good example in banking is when a consumer is looking to buy a car most banks will see it as ‘selling a car loan’ at bankmobile we are looking at it from another angle – being to facilitate the process of ‘buying the car’ and we want it to be awesome we want to create a world where a customer tells us the kind of car they want we find it we finance it we offer suggestions as to whether to buy outright or get a loan and we’ll get that car delivered to you now we could never do this alone but what we want to do is create the cross industry partnerships to make it happen in this instance we would work with car companies individual contractors multiple partners to make it happen – it’s an amazing opportunity” so what does the next five years look like for bankmobile given it is the fastest growing bank in the us with average deposits having grown by a staggering  per year and deposits currently at  billion we expect it’s exponential “the main challenges for success is in acquiring customers and we don’t think our potential has yet been even near reached what we are aiming to do is find ways to acquire customers in large quantities we think partnerships as i have outlined is where we will find these massive pools as well as communities of individuals these communities are where we can find likeminded people whose needs are not being met every unique community has their own unique needs in the us there are the nurses the policeman the couples with young children the students each is their own community each with their own unique need we are in the process of identifying the needs and offering the applicable solutions” he describes how bankmobile are doing some pretty impressive things to drum up attention throughout these communities one being through their ‘bankmobilists’ jay and his team saw a fantastic opportunity in college students or the wealth of the future you could say by encouraging entrepreneurship of college ambassadors to be the vocal promotors of the benefits offered by bankmobile “the thing with mobile banking is that they understand it and they love it where other banks are putting bank branches in close proximity to colleges we have bankmobilists in the college mobile in hand isn’t it always chatting to their peers and it’s working” from a man who used to run the seventeenth largest bank in usa with over  staff we closed with jay’s perspective on operating with a slim  full time staff and what he loves about it “i’ve been in the banking business for years and i’ve never had more fun than i am now it’s not easy we face challenges all the time but i am excited to be surrounded by some of the most innovative people i’ve ever met and they are young the enthusiasm you see in young people is what makes the difference the want to make things different attract different customers and work in a very different environment it’s working with innovative people encouraging them and finding ways to eliminate any bureaucracies  that at the end of the day is creating something awesome”     most read danny aranda managing director europe ripple uk  days ago interviews the superheroes of money  europe  days ago insights make no

login menu you are here home  magazine  archives  nd quarter   a second act for jay sidhu magazine  archives  nd quarter  a second act for jay sidhu by jack milligan editor in chief for bank director april nd  tweet jay s sidhu is a builder and during his  years as chief executive officer at sovereign bancorp inc he built it from a small thrift in wyomissing pennsylvania into one of the largest banks in the country with  billion in assets he was an aggressive deal maker who did so many acquisitions that they became a line of business just like checking accounts and home mortgages sidhu left sovereign in  after a prolonged and bitter struggle with an activist investor who thought his wheeling and dealing was hurting the company news reports at the time said sidhu had been pushed out by sovereign’s board  of directors and the company later disclosed in a regulatory filing that he had faced termination for cause although sidhu has always maintained that he took early retirement  after a restless couple of years in which he played golf a game he doesn’t particularly enjoy and set up two funds to invest in financial companies while waiting for his noncompete agreement to expire the yearold sidhu returned to the banking business when he and a group of investors acquired new century bank an ailing institution in the suburban philadelphia market sidhu renamed it customers bank and also recruited several exsovereign bankers to join his senior team so sidhu is back in business but the industry is much different today than when he left—and apparently so is he sidhu is still doing deals—in fact he has completed three of them since  and two more are pending but they were small transactions just to gain access to new markets and the bank has about  billion in assets and about  branches in pennsylvania new jersey new york and connecticut of far greater importance to sidhu is customers bank’s organic growth strategy which is designed around niche lending ambitious substitution of technology for brickandmortar distribution and strong customer service “our model is either we do de novo expansion or we do acquisitions if they’re cheaper than de novo” explains sidhu “otherwise we will not do a deal that’s very different than the way we did it in the past” and so far it has worked quite well customers bank turned in an impressive performance on bank director magazine’s  growth leaders ranking which ranked all us banks and thrifts across four key growth areas core income defined as netinterest income plus noninterest income excluding availableforsale gains and losses and otherrealestateowned gains and losses core deposits net loans and leases and core noninterest income customers bank placed first in the core income and net loans and leases categories and second in the noninterest income category the core income ranking is the most important since it is inclusive of the other three “customers bank has achieved excellent growth by executing its unique operating strategy and listening to its market to deliver the right products and services to the right customers” says kevin tweddle president of bank intelligence solutions a subsidiary of fiserv inc that constructed the growth rankings using data from regulatory agency call reports for the first three quarters of  the business environment for banks is certainly tougher today than when sidhu left sovereign in  in fact he pretty much missed the financial crisis in its entirety back then banks were more highly leveraged and had the wind of a strong us economy and booming housing market at their backs today of course economic growth is lukewarm at best and the housing market is still recovering from its catastrophic collapse in  banks are also much more tightly regulated than before the crisis and they are required to carry much higher levels of capital which drives down their financial returns indeed given the stiff headwinds banks are facing today one must wonder why sidhu was so keen to get back in the game “we’ve run little banks we’ve run midsized banks and we’ve run one of the top  banks in the country” he says referring to himself and his seasoned team of senior exsovereign executives “we’ve made mistakes along the way and we’ve learned from our mistakes this is a tough environment but it’s also one of the best environments if you have a unique strategy a talented management team and capital this is about the best time to be in the banking business” some of customers bank’s loan growth has come in such breadandbutter categories as small business commercial and industrial multifamily and commercial real estate but the lion’s share of its growth has come from mortgage warehouse lending where it provides funding to nonbank originators that market has shrunk drastically since the collapse of the housing market and it was one that sidhu sought to exploit early on in fact glenn hedde executive vice president and president of customers bank’s warehouse lending operation was one of sidhu’s first hires when he came back the business has a relatively low credit risk because the shortterm loans turn over on a relatively short cycle which drives up the bank’s loan volume while also producing approximately  million a month in fees “we have hired some of the best people in the industry to do it” hedde says “when a lot of other banks were exiting the business we were able to get in and build a goodsized operation with some scale we have a relationship model we’re not just there to charge the customer we’re there to help them and when they have a need we’re there to solve it” the bank also places a premium on speed and execution which president and chief operating officer richard a ehst believes differentiates customers bank from its competitors “you won’t find another  billion bank that operates with just  employees” says ehst who held several senior positions at sovereign “we are a flat organization by design we focus on execution strategy without execution is kind of a hollow suit we spend a considerable amount of time making sure we can deliver on our promises” another key element in customers bank’s growth strategy is its heavy utilization of technology to keep its distribution costs down the bank has a small branch network given the breadth of its geographic market and most of the branches it does have are only about  square feet in size most of them don’t even have driveup facilities instead individual and business customers are encouraged to use customers bank’s online and mobile channels for example customers can make a deposit by simply accessing their account through their smart phone and taking a picture of the check the bank also provides a concierge service where a banker will visit a customer’s home or office  hours a day seven days a week to handle his or her needs executive vice president warren taylor a former sovereign division president who runs customers bank’s community banking operation says his branches average about  million in deposits compared to  million for most big banks customers bank’s heavy reliance on technology over brickandmortar distribution also gives him a significant cost advantage over his competitors taken together the advantages of high deposit footings and low overhead allows him to run a profitable branch banking business while paying  to  basis points more for deposits than other banks in his market “we can bring customers in by offering them an exceptional value” he says “the reason why we can do that is our overhead is so low” sidhu is in the process of extending the customers bank brand from boston to washington dc some of that expansion will be de novo and some will most likely be acquisitions as when the bank bought troy michiganbased flagstar bancorp inc’s new england commercial banking business including a team of veteran bankers sidhu will use that platform to expand throughout the region he also intends to list customers bank’s stock on a public exchange later this year the company files regular financial reports with the securities and exchange commission so technically it’s a public company and having a liquid stock will make it easier for him to do more targeted deals “we are not about growth for the sake of growth” says sidhu “that is not in our strategy but we see so many growth opportunities that we can’t stop”    tags jack milligan is editor in chief of bank director an information resource for directors and officers of financial companies you can connect with jack on linkedin or
