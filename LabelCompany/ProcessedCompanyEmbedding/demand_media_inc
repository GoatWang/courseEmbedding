nongaap financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” demand media uses certain nongaap financial measures as described below these nongaap financial measures are presented to enhance the user’s overall understanding of demand media’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures presented in this release are the primary measures used by the company’s management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the company’s financial performance and operating trends    including periodtoperiod comparisons because they exclude certain expenses that management believes are not indicative of the company’s core operating results management also uses these measures to prepare and update the company’s short and long term financial and operational plans including evaluating investment decisions and in its discussions with investors commercial bankers securities analysts and other users of the company’s financial statements   the use of nongaap financial measures has certain limitations because they do not reflect all items of income and expense or cash flows that affect the company’s operations an additional limitation of nongaap financial measures is that they do not have standardized meanings and therefore other companies including peer companies may use the same or similarly named measures but exclude different items or use different computations management compensates for these limitations by reconciling these nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures in the tables captioned “reconciliations of nongaap financial measures” included at the end of this release investors and others are encouraged to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure   the company defines adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding income loss from discontinued operations net of taxes net interest expense income tax expense benefit and certain other noncash or nonrecurring items impacting net income loss from time to time principally comprised o f depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and  in fiscal  goodwill impairment    management believes that the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of the company’s underlying core revenue and operating costs that is focused more closely on the current costs necessary to operate our businesses and reflects the company’s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful analysis of trends management also believes that excluding certain noncash charges can be useful because the amount of such expenses is the result of longterm investment decisions in previous periods rather than daytoday operating decisions   the company defines adjusted net income loss as net income loss excluding income loss from discontinued operations net of taxes and the effect of certain noncash items and other items not directly related to the operation of the company’s ongoing business principally comprised of   stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets    a cquisition and realignment costs and gains or losses on asset dispositions adjusted net income loss is calculated using the application of a normalized effective tax rate the company defines adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps as adjusted net income loss divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding management believes that adjusted net income loss and adjusted eps provide investors with additional useful information to measure the company’s financial performance particularly from period to period because they exclude certain noncash and other expenses that are not directly related to the operation of the company’s ongoing business   the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by used in operating activities net of cash outflows from acquisition and realignment activities capital expenditures to acquire property and equipment and purchases of intangible assets management believes that free cash flow provides investors with useful information to measure operating liquidity because it reflects the company’s underlying cash flows from recurring operating activities after investing in capital assets and intangible assets free cash flow is used by management and may also be useful for investors to assess the company’s ability to generate cash flow for a variety of strategic opportunities including reinvesting in the business pursuing new business opportunities and potential acquisitions paying dividends and repurchasing

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to

muñozdonoso is going to make this job pay he’s got to move quickly he has a list of  videos to shoot on this warm june morning for which he’ll earn just  to get anything close to his usual rate he’ll have to do it all in two hours as he sets up his three video cameras on the rocky shore of a manmade lake in huntington massachusetts he thinks about the way things used to be he once spent two weeks in a bird blind in his native chile to capture striking footage of a rarely seen andean condor but those jobs are almost as endangered as that bird now he trades finesse for speed today’s topic is kayaking muñozdonoso has enlisted a local instructor to meet him and to bring along four of his boats every five minutes muñozdonoso’s assistant shouts a new subject — “kayak basics” “paddling tips” — and the expert sitting in one of his rigs in the bourboncolored water riffs off the top of his head muñozdonoso gets most of his shots in one take but conditions are working against him shifting winds and changing light require him to adjust his setup the instructor keeps switching kayaks and gear finally the entire shoot has to be put on hold as three bearded fishermen loudly and slowly drag their boats into the lake directly into the frame muñozdonoso hoped to finish his shoot by  but it’s already  when he crams his equipment into the back of his suv and speeds back to his office  mile away he climbs a flight of stairs to his studio above a strip mall unloads his gear and keeps up his breakneck pace as he opens his files in final cut pro he winces “normally i’d eliminate the wind or the kid screaming in the background” he says “but in this case we don’t do any of that” he points out that the focus is off the rippling water is sharp while the kayaking instructor is slightly blurred but the company he’s working for won’t care he says so why should he — especially for  a clip within a few hours he has uploaded his work to demand media his employer for the day it isn’t scorsese but it’s fast cheap and good enough thousands of other filmmakers and writers around the country are operating with the same loose standards racing to produce the  videos and articles that demand media publishes every day the company’s ambitions are so enormous as to be almost surreal to predict any question anyone might ask and generate an answer that will show up at the top of google’s search results to get there demand is using an army of muñoz donosos to feverishly crank out articles and videos they shoot slapdash instructional videos with titles like “how to draw a greek helmet” and “dog whistle training techniques” they write guides about lunch meat safety and nonprofit administration they pump out an endless stream of bulleted lists and tutorials about the most esoteric of subjects how to give the people what they want demand media has created a virtual factory that pumps out  videoclips and articles a day it starts with an algorithm the algorithm is fed inputs from three sources search terms popular terms from more than  sources comprising  billion searches a day the ad market a snapshot of which keywords are sought after and how much they are fetching and the competition what’s online already and where a term ranks in search results plenty of other companies — aboutcom mahalo answerscom — have tried to corner the market in arcane online advice but none has gone about it as aggressively scientifically and singlemindedly as demand pieces are not dreamed up by trained editors nor commissioned based on submitted questions instead they are assigned by an algorithm which mines nearly a terabyte of search data internet traffic patterns and keyword rates to determine what users want to know and how much advertisers will pay to appear next to the answers the process is automatic random and endless a stirling engine fueled by the world’s unceasing desire to know how to grow avocado trees from pits or how to throw an atlanta bravesthemed birthday party it is a database of human needs and if you haven’t stumbled on a demand video or article yet you soon will by next summer according to founder and ceo richard rosenblatt demand will be publishing  million items a month the equivalent of four englishlanguage wikipedias a year demand is already one of the largest suppliers of content to youtube where its  videos make up more than twice the content of cbs the associated press al jazeera english universal music group collegehumor and soulja boy combined demand also posts its material to its network of  blist sites — ranging from ehow and livestrongcom to the littleknown doggyphoto site thedailypuppycom — that manage to pull in more traffic than espn nbc universal and time warner’s online properties excluding aol put together to appreciate the impact demand is poised to have on the web imagine a classroom where one kid raises his hand after every question and screams out the answer he may not be smart or even right but he makes it difficult to hear anybody else the result is a factory stamping out moneymaking content “i call them the henry ford of online video” says jordan hoffner director of content partnerships at youtube media companies like the atlanta journalconstitution aol and usa today have either hired demand or studied its innovations this year the privately held demand is expected to bring in about  million in revenue its most recent round of financing by bluechip investors valued the company at  billion in this industrial model of content creation muñozdonoso is working the conveyor belt — being paid very little for cranking out an endless supply of material he admits that the results are not particularly rewarding but work is work and demand’s is steady and pays on time plus he says “this is the future” he has shot more than  videos for demand filming yoyo whizzes pole dancers and fly fishermen but ask him to pick a favorite and he’s stumped “i can’t really remember most of them” he says in an era overwhelmed by flickryoutubewikipediabloggerfacebooktwitterborne logorrhea it’s hard to argue that the world needs another massive online content company but what demand has realized is that the internet gets only half of the simplest economic formula right it has the supply part down but ignores demand give a million monkeys a million wordpress accounts and you still might never get a sevenpoint tutorial on how to keep wasps away from a swimming pool yet that’s what people want to know ask byron reese video on demand demand media wants to answer any question anybody has about anything that means covering the obscure and the very obscure the besttasting vodka one bartender’s opinion “belvedere for me comes from a long line of vodkas in poland poland has always known how to do vodka” case closed demand video vodka reese is a tall texan who serves as demand’s chief innovation officer and who created the ideaspawning algorithm that lies at the heart of demand’s process to determine what articles to assign his formula analyzes three chunks of information first to find out what terms users are searching for it parses bulk data purchased from search engines isps and internet marketing firms as well as demand’s own traffic logs then the algorithm crunches keyword rates to calculate how much advertisers will pay to appear on pages that include those terms a portion of demand’s revenue comes from google which allows businesses to bid on phrases that they would like to advertise against third the formula checks to see how many web pages already include those terms it doesn’t make sense to commission an article that will be buried on the fifth page of google results finally the algorithm like a drunken prophet starts spitting out phrase after phrase “butterfly cake” “shin splints” “harleydavidson belt buckles” but that’s just the start armed with those key words another algorithm called the knowledge engine dives back into the data to figure out exactly what people want to know about the term if the original algorithm divines “ chevy corvette” as a profitable title the knowledge engine will return with “cost of  corvette” for “shin splint” it might come back with “equine treatment shin splints” the second algorithm also looks at how well past titles with similar words have performed in terms of ad revenue demand has learned for instance that “best” and “how to” bring in traffic or high clickthrough rates while “history of” is ad poison at the end of the process the company has a topic and a dollar amount — the term’s “lifetime value” or ltv — that demand expects to generate from any resulting content video on demand demand media wants to answer any question anybody has about anything that means covering the obscure and the very obscure how to heelflip on a skateboard more than just providing tips the skateboarding expert also digs into the history of the trick “the heel flip” he explains “is rooted in the ollie” demand video heelflip the focus on ltv keeps demand away from any kind of breaking news coverage or investigative work neither of which tends to hold its value it does however produce the kind of evergreen stories typically seen in newspaper features sections the atlanta journalconstitution recently commissioned demand to produce some travel articles that ran online and in print the algorithm’s endless ramblings — a collection of cacophonous phrases and esoteric subjects — seem haphazard and chaotic but reese knows there is logic at work when asked for the most valuable topic in demand’s arsenal he replies instantly “‘where can i donate a car in dallas’ one you have a certain number of people searching for it two the bid term ‘donate a car’ is in the doubledigit dollars like  or  per click people have a propensity —  percent — to click on an ad when they see the word car there’s very little competition and the article will retain its value for a long time” so why dallas he has no idea “dallas just happens to be the location where we know people are searching for how to donate a car” that’s not to say there isn’t any room for humans in demand’s process they just aren’t worth very much first a crowdsourced team of freelance “title proofers” turn the algorithm’s often awkward or nonsensical phrases into something people will understand “how to make a churchpew breakfast nook” for example becomes “how to make a breakfast nook out of a church pew” approved headlines get fed into a passwordprotected section of demand’s web site called demand studios where any demand freelancer can see what jobs are available it’s the online equivalent of day laborers waiting in front of home depot writers can typically select  articles at a time videographers can hoard  nearly every freelancer scrambles to load their assignment queue with titles they can produce quickly and with the least amount of effort — because pay for individual stories is so lousy only a highspeed highvolume approach will work the average writer earns  per article for pieces that top out at a few hundred words and the average filmmaker about  per clip paid weekly via paypal demand also offers revenue sharing on some articles though it can take months to reach even  in such payments other freelancers sign up for the chance to copyedit  an article factcheck  an article approve the quality of a film  to  cents a video transcribe  to  per video or offer up their expertise to be quoted or filmed free title proofers get  cents a headline coming soon photographers and photo editors so far the company has paid out more than  million to demand studios workers if the enterprise reaches rosenblatt’s goal of producing  million pieces of content a month the payouts could easily hit  million a year less than a third of what the new york times shells out in wages and benefits to produce its roughly  articles a month before reese came up with his formula demand media operated in the traditional way contributors suggested articles or videos they wanted to create editors trained in the ways of search engine optimization would approve or deny each while also coming up with their own ideas the process worked fine but once it was automated every algorithmgenerated piece of content produced  times the revenue of the humancreated ideas so rosenblatt got rid of the editors suddenly profit on each piece was  to  times what it had been it turned out that gut instinct and experience were less effective at predicting what readers and viewers wanted — and worse for the company — than a formula the humans also couldn’t produce ideas at the scale of the algorithm on a recent day demand studios had nearly  freelance assignments ready to be filled coming up with that many ideas takes more than a white board and a conference room jammed with editors and to demand scale is essential one outside search engine marketer estimates that demand earns a mere  to  cents per ad clicked it takes millions of clicks to build a real business out of that volume is also crucial to demand’s top distribution partner google the search engine has struggled to make money from the  billion videos on youtube only about  percent of which carry ads advertisers don’t want to pay to appear next to videos that hijack copyrighted material or that contain swear words but youtube doesn’t have the personnel to comb through every usergenerated clip last year though youtube executives noticed that demand was uploading hundreds of videos every day — prescrubbed by demand’s own editors explicitly designed to appeal to advertisers and cheap enough to benefit from google’s revenuesharing business model youtube executives approached demand asked the company to join its revenuesharing program and encouraged it to produce as many videos as possible since then the two companies have grown even closer when youtube’s sales team bemoaned the tiny supply of spanishlanguage videos for it to run advertisements against youtube’s hoffner called up demand within weeks demand studios started issuing spanishlanguage assignments soon it had uploaded a few hundred clips to youtube — everything from how to be “un buen dj” to how to fix a bathroom towel bar “i know we do deals with the espns and abcs of the world but demand is incredibly important to us” says hoffner who is married to wired’s executive director of communications “they fill up a lot of content across the site” and they do it by taking what used to be a deeply human and intuitive endeavor and turning it into a purely mathematical and rational one this reese says is the ultimate promise of his algorithm “you can take something that is thought of as a creative process and turn it into a manufacturing process” richard rosenblatt was born and raised in southern california’s san fernando valley and has rarely ventured far from hollywood’s orbit in spirit or in geography he is  and wiry with carefully tousled brown hair a brightwhite everpresent smile and a long pinched nose one day this spring rosenblatt was in the foyer of demand’s santa monica california headquarters casually chatting with brooke burke — the bikini model former tv host and dancing with the stars winner — and her fiancè a baywatch actor rosenblatt is also friends with cyclist and demand investor lance armstrong a fact that he mentions frequently “i’m supposed to go to france wednesday with lance but i just can’t” he confided sighing “it’s a lot of travel” he is particularly fond of the exhortation “go big or go home” a phrase that he includes in his email signature and has commemorated in the naming of demand’s go big conference room numerous executives told me that when they first met rosenblatt they were immediately repulsed he was too slick and seemed to be missing the geek edge “then in five minutes you’re like ‘holy cow this guy has it all to back it up” says quincy smith ceo of cbs interactive demand is just the latest of rosenblatt’s run of startups nearly all of which hewed to his “go big” mantra after graduating from usc law school in  he saw that companies were growing curious about the internet so he set up a company that offered a  webdesign seminar that came with a custombuilt web site the startup which was later called imall went public at  a share shot up to  then plummeted when the federal trade commission investigated the firm’s claim that its clients’ sites were earning  a month they weren’t it turned out rosenblatt was forced to kill the seminar division losing  percent of his company’s  million in annual revenue he quickly refocused on imall’s other business of providing an ecommerce platform for small and mediumsized companies and sold the company in  to excitehome for  million in stock rosenblatt bought a ferrari excitehome soon went bust in  rosenblatt took over the ailing drkoopcom an online site tied to c everett koop where others saw just another ad dependent diseaseinformation site rosenblatt saw a chance to turn the bearded former surgeon general into a brand the next “martha stewart or walt disney — but for health” as he told businessweek at the time he created a line of dr koop men’s prostate formula pills the company went under perhaps weary of going big rosenblatt went home where he derived some comfort from the millions he had earned he bought and sold a domain registrar company he started a site called superdudes where users could create superherolike avatars he invested in a nightclub in san diego but with the birth of web  big was back in  a group of investors tapped rosenblatt to run euniverse later renamed intermix media a struggling internet conglomerate that happened to own myspace soon after rosenblatt started new york attorney general eliot spitzer charged intermix with bundling adware and spyware with its free games and screensavers rosenblatt settled almost immediately handing over  million — the entire cash holdings of intermix “it was the worst most miserable time in my life” he says still he could be consoled by the fact that his company had survived and still had myspace which was exploding into the internet’s dominant social media site aol viacom and news corp were all sniffing around and rosenblatt began to play them off each other not long after settling with spitzer he sold intermix to news corp for  million of which he earned  million then he left the company video on demand demand media wants to answer any question anybody has about anything that means covering the obscure and the very obscure how to pack for a trip to spain fans of this european tour guide’s earlier “how to pack for a trip to rome” will note that she’s now pushing strappy high heels over conservative pumps demand video packing for spain although rosenblatt had been at myspace for only  months he had seen enough to come up with a theory the social network was doing it wrong it had built a supersite aggregating millions of users and encouraging them to root around but they had difficulty finding information about specific subjects “i kept thinking about gardening” he says “people wanted to talk about gardening but they didn’t want to do it on myspace” instead they went to google which was its own kind of aggregator collecting everyone who searched for specific terms and directing them to appropriate sites if he could collect enough tiny sites and sell google ads against them he could potentially build a more successful business than he could with one supersite on the strength of this plan rosenblatt raised  million from funders like goldman sachs oak investment partners and legendary investor gordon crawford then he went looking for acquisitions he bought enom one of the largest domain registrars and pluck a company that handles commenting and social networks for web sites along with dozens of amateurcontent sites that could catch lowly keyword ads among them ehow trailscom golflinkcom and cracked com rosenblatt now had three revenue sources domain sales services and video banner and google ads demand media was born but it wasn’t until  when the company bought expertvillagecom byron reese’s howto site reportedly for roughly  million that it began to realize its potential reese and rosenblatt soon began working on an idea that reese had long struggled with millions of visitors were coming to expertvillage and generating reams of data but his editors didn’t do anything with it what if they used that information to determine what content to create here is the thing that rosenblatt has since discovered online content is not worth very much this may be a truism but rosenblatt has the hard mathematical proof it’s right there in black and white in the demand media database — the lifetime value of every story algorithmically derived and very very small most media companies are trying hard to increase those numbers to boost the value of their online content until it matches the amount of money it costs to produce but rosenblatt thinks they have it exactly backward instead of trying to raise the market value of online content to match the cost of producing it — perhaps an impossible proposition — the secret is to cut costs until they match the market value not everybody agrees with him howcast one of demand’s largest competitors also produces explainer videos and howtos unlike demand the company employs a staff of editors and writers and gets freelance voiceover pros filmmakers can earn a couple thousand dollars shooting the videos and the difference is noticeable howcast’s “how to make friends at a new school” includes such useful tidbits as “sit in the middle of the classroom to surround yourself with as many potential new friends as possible” demandowned ehow’s “how to be popular in school” video in contrast offers such vague guidance as “be nice to everybody” “we believe that quality holds longterm value” howcast ceo jason liebman says he emphasizes that his team comes up with titles the oldfashioned way deciding what people want to learn based on their own instincts what holidays and events are coming up and from general research yet howcast pulls a tiny — and getting tinier — fraction of the traffic that ehow does and liebman hesitantly acknowledges that he’s working on an algorithm to compete with demand liebman isn’t the only one ready to mimic demand’s approach cbs interactive — which owns cnet urbanbaby gamespot and other sites — also deploys an algorithm that helps guide what its sites cover aol is working on one as well smaller sites like helium and associated content are trying to bring their own flood of freelancerwritten work to the net using many of the same contributors as demand the fact is the demand way may be inescapable a senior executive at a major media company likened demand’s algorithmicbased contentcreation factory to what he saw in the advertising industry in the past decade experience relationships and gut checks started losing out to raw data “to customers advertising may not look that different but the systems to deliver the right ads to the right consumer at the right time have changed dramatically” he says “the content systems are going through the early early stages of that right now” still rosenblatt says he is trying to place a new emphasis on quality “there’s a constant debate internally” he says “this might sound crazy but i’d rather spend more and put more quality into the process long term we’ll make more money by increasing quality” but when he gets into the details it’s clear that he’s not moving far from his henry ford model “we’re not talking about  videos so a couple dollars here or there can make a serious difference for instance pay an extra dollar for factchecking” how can anyone survive on that good question google it if the answer isn’t out there it soon will be senior writer daniel roth danielrothwiredcom wrote about
