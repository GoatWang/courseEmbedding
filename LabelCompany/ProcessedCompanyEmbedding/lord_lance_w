people who need simple and convenient image resizing tool initially planned to review only resizr but things got out of control after dicovering several good alternatives so here you go normally any extensive image editing best done using desktop software like photoshop that can do lot more then mere resizing but when all you need is simply to resize picture starting fat photoshop is not very convenient resizr a product of lordlancecom is a web based tool for resizing images online to resize image simply go to the resizrlordlancecom click on the “browse” button to select the image specify desired width and click ‘resize’ button in addition to local images you can also resize images from the web resizr also offers a firefox plugin to make things even easier and faster one drawback is that it only resizes jpg files doing some resizing of sofia alternative tools resizrcom this service has same name but actually different it supports jpg gif and png formats but looks quite ugly imagewell something for mac users this is free image editing software for quick manipulation and upload to an idisk mac account ftp server or other web server i was not able to test this one so no comments or promises here microsoft image resizerwin xp users this needs to be downloaded and installed before use but totally worth it using this one images can simply be resized though ‘image right click  resize image’ imagesquashcom nothing really extraordinary that distinguished it from above ones supports jpg gif and png formats myisizecom allmost a copy of above reviewed resizrlordlancecom but with a little different look resizemailcom has some extra good featuresgif jpg formats no longer works dosizecom if you need to resize multiple images simultaneouslyupto  images this is a tool to use pxncom simple and good looking web based photoshop alternative snipshot – one of the easiest to use and also offers browser plugins for firefox ie and safari more or less all of the services above do the same task of resizing images however when it comes to selecting few i would give my preference to the microsoft image resizer a desktop application from microsoft and as among web based tools i really liked tools from resizrlordlancecom and snipshotcom previous posthowstuffworks – discover how stuff worksnext post ebay tips to get the best of ebay  comments write a comment leave a reply

reading exif information from pictures but there is also option for resizing images reply reshade may   at  pm thanks for the list i think reshade is far better than any other resizing tool the quality that it offers in the resized pictures is one of the best and itâ€™s a lot cheaper than other competitor products it took quite some time to discover and i wish people would talk more about it reply alfred november   at  pm thanks for putting myisize in you said  myisizecom allmost a copy of above reviewed resizrlordlancecom but with a little different look but actually resizr the main subject of the article supports only gif and myisize supports jpg png and gif thanks reply aibek november   at  pm oooops completely missed it thanks for pointing it out reply kaly arslan esengulov
