fasano stepping down as high point softball coach  new jersey herald  autos  real estate  jobs  classifieds july   log in  subscribe  customer service log in  subscribe july   sports fasano stepping down as high point softball coach posted jan  0  am updated jan 6 0  am by peter steinpsteinnjheraldcomfor barbara fasano the choice was clear but that doesnt mean it was easyfasano loves teaching its in her blood its part of why she became high points head softball coach in the first place  because that involves teaching toobut teaching in the classroom is one of her top priorities shes been doing that for  years overall  at high point so when fasano a social studies teacher had the chance to take on an advanced placement world history course a firstever offering at the school she jumped at it it came at a time when she also had more familial obligations which meant that something in her life had to give that something was coaching softballso after  seasons coaching the wildcats  a stretch that included two state championships two sectional championships two hunterdon warren sussex tournament championships and two njac american division championships  fasano is stepping downi¹ve been part of the high point softball family for over a decade and i just felt it was the right time said fasano the heralds softball coach of the year in 0 and 0 it was an extremely difficult decision for me though im really going to miss the girls and the fun weve had over the years  i did have tears in my eyes when i handed in my resignation letter i just had to go with my heartshe had mentioned it to me before she had done it so i kind of knew that it was coming former high point pitcher ally frei now at boston college said of fasanos resignation i completely understand i think it was the best decision for her and her family it was just the right time for her to step downfasano said she isnt sure whether jim fasano her husband of 0 years and longtime softball assistant will remain with the team that she says will be up to whomever takes her place which has yet to be decided although she thinks another of her high point assistants ryan gallagher would be a great choiceas fasano leaves high point softball behind  at least the coaching not the rooting aspect of it  she does so with as much pride as sadness guiding the wildcats to an extrainning victory over kingsway in the 0 group  final and another one over robbinsville in last years group  championship game was certainly a thrill for fasano climbing all the way up the mountain is what teams strive to do and high point did it twice in the past three seasonsbut it was not the endall and beall for fasano just a byproduct of what she tried to instill in her players and the atmosphere she brought aboutwhen i look back and i have all these memories its awesome² fasano saidbut it wasnt really about winning it was about building relationships i have had very special moments and times with the girls in years when we werent the champions we always had great relationshipsincluding one with player aimee stormes who eventually became one of her assistant coaches that speaks so much about the rapport weve built over the years fasano saidand stormes isnt the only one who still has a rapport with fasanoholidays when i get a text from these girls that i havent seen in a while all of that is really special fasano said and thats why im blessed that i coached at high pointfasano took over high points headcoaching position in  though already ensconced as a social studies teacher she admits she was a bit green when it came to coaching softballthat was really scary fasano recalled i had no high school softball coaching experience i had coached my daughter lauren when she was younger but it coaching high school softball was a whole new ballgame i did what i had to do  i went to coaches clinics and i learned a lot and then i got to coach its just been a wonderful journeybarbara and jim fasano were fixtures in the high point softball coaching ranks so much so that their players referred to them as coach mrs andcoach mr before frei was throwing perfect games before jamie christensen and ally curry were catching them before carly satter was breaking school batting average records before chelsea eckert was excelling at both pitching and hitting coach mrs and coach mr were there mrs coaching first base mr over at thirdjim fasano yelling lotsa hop girls lotsa hop as they headed on and off the field between innings barb fasanos get here get here get here shouts when a high point player was trying to beat out a grounder were as familiar sounds at high point games as the whoosh of a frei fastball as the crack of satters and eckerts batsbarbara fasanos run coaching high point softball is now over but her relationships with the players her softballfamily ties will go on fasano wont let her former players down just as she didnt when they were her current onesi remember her always being there for me always supporting me in everything that i did frei said not only just being there for softball she was always there whether it was school or outside of school someone that i could go to in the building or at any timethey knew my door was always open and i was always there  if they needed me for advice for school whatever else they wanted to talk about fasano said it built a really nice rapport and i treasured that more in sports sussex county miners giarraputo the key to latest miners victory baseball kittatinny hosting state little league finals carl barbati column little leaguers
