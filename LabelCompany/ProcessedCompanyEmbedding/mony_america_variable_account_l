business plan by each insurance company to make its contracts more attractive to existing contract owners participants or prospective purchasers as the case may be and more efficient to administer and oversee each insurance company represents that it has carefully reviewed its contracts and each investment option offered under its contracts with the goal of providing a superior choice of investment options  among the principal purposes of the substitutions the section  applicants assert that the removed portfolios generally have not attracted sufficient contract owner or participant interest to support maintaining them as separate investment options under the contracts particularly where they duplicate or substantially overlap with other investment options offered through the separate accounts as of december   the separate accounts had allocated approximately the following amounts to the removed and replacement portfolios start printed page  substitution number—removed portfolios

maintain that substituting the replacement portfolios for the removed portfolios would lead to greater efficiencies in administering the contracts and potentially enable the insurance companies to offer a wider range of investment options in the future that would be more attractive to contract owners and participants in this connection the section  applicants note that the deletion of unpopular investment options would create additional capacity on their systems and platforms to offer new investment options  the section  applicants further assert that the substitutions also are designed and intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the contracts and the investment options available through the separate accounts in certain cases the insurance companies offer several investment alternatives that overlap one another by having similar investment objectives policies and risks the proposed substitutions would eliminate these overlapping investment alternatives the section  applicants believe that the deletion of overlapping investment options should not adversely affect contract owners and participants given that other similar investment options will remain available under the contracts and that the contracts will either offer the same number of investment options or in those cases where the number of investment options is being reduced continue to offer a significant number of alternative investment options currently expected to range in number from  to  after the substitutions versus  to  before the substitutions  in addition some contracts offer investment alternatives from multiple fund complexes each with its own prospectus and disclosure format which significantly increases the volume and complexity of information that is received by contract owners and participants the insurance companies believe that this situation may be confusing to contract owners and participants by substituting the replacement portfolios for the removed portfolios the respective insurance company anticipates that it would simplify the contract prospectuses and related materials provided to contract owners and participants and thereby reduce the potential for contract owner and participant confusion the section  applicants also assert that the substitutions will enable an insurance company to reduce certain costs that it incurs in administering the contracts by removing overlapping and unpopular portfolios and thereby allowing an insurance company to offer more competitively priced products in the future  the section  applicants note that contract owners and participants with subaccount balances invested in shares of the replacement portfolios will have the same or lower net operating expenses immediately after the substitutions in addition the insurance companies have agreed to impose certain expense limits on replacement portfolios to ensure that contract owners and participants on the substitution date incur the same or lower expense ratios for certain periods after the substitutions in addition many of the replacement portfolios are larger than their corresponding removed portfolios generally speaking larger funds tend to have lower expenses than comparable funds that are smaller this is because with a larger asset size fixed fund expenses are spread over a larger base lowering the expense ratios therefore as a result of certain substitutions various costs such as legal accounting printing and trustee fees will be spread over a larger base with each contract owner and participant bearing a smaller portion of the cost than would be the case if the replacement portfolios andor the trust as applicable were smaller in size larger funds also may have lower trading expenses potentially resulting in higher returns  the section  applicants also argue that certain of the proposed substitutions would replace an outside portfolio with a portfolio for which axa equitable serves as manager and thus would permit axa equitable start printed page under the multimanager order to appoint dismiss and replace advisers and amend advisory agreements as necessary to seek optimal performance from the portfolio and its portfolio managers notwithstanding the multimanager order with respect to the substitution involving the eqvan kampen real estate portfolio after the substitution date as defined herein the section  applicants agree not to change the adviser to the eqvan kampen real estate portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of either a the adviser change or b axa equitables continued ability to rely on the multimanager order even with respect to this substitution the section  applicants believe that the substitution would provide axa equitable as the investment manager of the trust with greater oversight capabilities with respect to portfolios offered through its contracts  moreover certain of the substitutions will replace an outside portfolio with a portfolio that is managed by axa equitable in this regard the relevant replacement portfolios generally are only available through the variable insurance and annuity products offered by axa equitable and its affiliates consequently the board of trustees of the relevant replacement portfolios has greater sensitivity to the needs of contract owners and participants the relevant substitutions also will provide axa equitable with more influence over the administrative aspects of the portfolios while providing contract owners and participants with the benefit of third party asset management influence is important because changes to removed portfolios can result in costly offcycle communications and mailings to contract owners and participants conversely for the relevant replacement portfolios axa equitable has greater influence over the pace and timing of such changes axa equitable believes that the relevant substitutions will enable it to exercise more influence over the management and administration of the portfolios thereby reducing costs and customer confusion the added influence will give axa equitable the ability to react more quickly to changes and problems it encounters in its oversight of the relevant replacement portfolios  the section  applicants also maintain that the substitutions will substitute shares of a replacement portfolio for shares of a removed portfolio which has very similar and in some cases substantially similar investment objectives investment policies and risks as those of the corresponding removed portfolio this fact is expected to simplify the process of explaining the substitutions to contract owners and participants including an explanation of the relevant differences in the policies of the replacement and removed portfolios and should facilitate their understanding of the effect of the substitutions on them a summary description of the investment objectives investment policies and

balanced portfolio class o shares mfs total return series initial class shares and the t rowe price personal strategy balanced portfolio to the extent that the annualized expense ratio of each applicable replacement portfolio exceeds for each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the two years following the date of the proposed substitutions the net expense ratio of the corresponding removed portfolio for fiscal year  the insurance companies will for each contract outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the two years following the date of the proposed substitution the subaccounts investing in the replacement portfolio such that the sum of the replacement portfolios net operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculations of subaccount unit value for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the removed portfolios net operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year   in addition with respect to the substitutions involving the fidelity growth portfolio initial class and service class shares and the universal equity growth portfolio class i shares the section  applicants agree that in connection with assets held under contracts affected by the substitutions the insurance companies will not receive for three years from the date of the proposed substitutions any direct or indirect benefits from the relevant replacement portfolio its advisers or underwriters or its affiliates at a rate higher than that which they had received from the corresponding removed portfolios their advisers or underwriters or their affiliates including without limitation b shareholder service administration or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangements in connection with such assets the insurance companies also represent that the proposed substitutions and the selection of the relevant replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to the insurance companies or their affiliates by the relevant replacement portfolio its advisers underwriters or affiliates applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without commission approval section c provides that “the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title”  the section  applicants assert that the each proposed substitution involves a substitution of securities within the meaning of section c of the  act and therefore request an order from the commission pursuant to section c approving the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants state they have reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the contracts both to protect themselves and their contract owners and participants in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a separate account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the insurance companies and their respective contract owners and participants  the section  applicants also argue that each replacement portfolio and its corresponding removed portfolio have similar and in some cases substantially similar or identical investment objectives policies and risks in addition each proposed substitution retains for contract owners and participants the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the contracts the section  applicants assert that any impact on the investment programs of affected contract owners and participants including the appropriateness of the available investment options should therefore be negligible  the section  applicants further assert that the ultimate effect of the substitutions would be to remove overlapping and duplicative investment options and those investment options that have not attracted sufficient contract owner or participant interest to support maintaining them as investment options under the contracts the substitutions will permit the insurance companies to present information to their contract owners and participants in a simpler and more concise manner and it is anticipated that after the proposed substitutions contract owners and participants will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their contracts  in addition the section  applicants also argue that in connection with each proposed substitution contract owners and participants with subaccount balances invested in a replacement portfolio will have the same or lower net operating expense ratios after the substitution in this regard each insurance company has agreed to impose certain expense limits as discussed above to ensure that contract owners and participants do not incur higher expenses as a result of a substitution either for a period of two years after the substitution or for the life of the contract as applicable  in addition to the foregoing the section  applicants generally submit that each proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to similar substitutions that the commission previously has approved the section  applicants also submit that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section c was designed to prevent as the contracts provide each contract owner or participant with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to contract owners or participants under their contracts additionally the substitutions will not in any manner reduce the nature or quality of the start printed page available investment options in this regard the proposed substitutions retain for contract owners and participants the investment flexibility which is a central feature of the contracts  moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners and participants the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfer and other market timing activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying contract owners and participants of the proposed substitutions which supplement has been delivered to contract owners and participants at least thirty  days before the substitutions and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the proposed substitutions the substitutions therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent  the section  applicants also note that the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract or participating in a group contract contract owners and participants select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their contract values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the section  applicants under the applicable contract as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the contract contract owners and participants also may have considered the insurance companys size financial condition and its reputation for service in selecting their contract these factors will not change as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will the annuity life or tax benefits afforded under the contracts held by any of the affected contract owners or participants  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the same persons acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application issue an order exempting any proposed transaction from the provisions of section a if i the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned ii the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and iii the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants request an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind transactions in connection with the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the inkind transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of each of the relevant removed portfolios and each of the relevant replacement portfolios as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the registration statement for the relevant investment company and as required by rule c under the  act the inkind transactions will not change the dollar value of any contract owners or participants investment in any of the separate accounts the value of any contract the accumulation value or other value credited to any contract or the death benefit payable under any contract after the proposed inkind transactions the value of a separate accounts investment in a replacement portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the corresponding removed portfolio together with the value of any preexisting investments in the replacement portfolio before the inkind transactions  the section  applicants state they will assure themselves that the inkind transactions will be in substantial compliance with the conditions of rule a under the  act the section  applicants will assure themselves that the investment companies will carry out the proposed inkind transactions in conformity with the conditions of rule a or as applicable a removed portfolios and a replacement portfolios normal valuation procedures as set forth in the relevant investment companys registration statement except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash  the section  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned furthermore the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind transactions will be consistent with the policies of the removed and corresponding replacement portfolios as recited in their respective current registration statements and that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act and do not present any conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent conclusion for the reasons set forth in the application the applicants each respectively request that the commission issue an order of approval pursuant to section c of the  act and an order of exemption pursuant to section b of the  act start

contract owners or to prospective purchasers as the case may be each insurance company has reviewed its contracts and each investment option offered under its contracts with the goal of providing a superior choice of investment alternatives the substitutions are being proposed to address the lack of contract owner interest in the removed portfolios which generally have not attracted sufficient contract owner interest to support maintaining them as separate investment options under the contracts particularly where they duplicate or substantially overlap with other investment options offered through the separate accounts the substitutions also are intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the contracts and the investment options available through the separate accounts additionally each substitution will substitute shares of the replacement portfolio for shares of the removed portfolio which has similar investment objectives policies and risks as the replacement portfolio in addition the insurance companies have agreed to impose certain expense limits with respect to the replacement portfolios for certain periods after the substitutions as described below furthermore the substitutions ultimately may enable the insurance companies to reduce certain of the costs that they incur in administering the contracts by removing overlapping and unpopular portfolios moreover the proposed substitutions would replace an unaffiliated portfolio with a portfolio for which axa equitable serves as manager and thus would permit axa equitable to appoint dismiss and replace advisers and amend advisory agreements as necessary to seek optimal performance from the portfolio and its portfolio managers finally the substitutions are designed to provide contract owners with an opportunity to continue their investment in a similar portfolio without interruption and without any cost to them  the insurance companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the substitutions and related filings and notices including legal accounting brokerage and other fees and expenses on the effective date of the substitutions

fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions all contractlevel fees will remain the same after the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because each proposed substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of

fund—bonddebenture portfolio at no time after the date of the proposed substitutions will the insurance companies increase the total separate account charges net of any waiver or reimbursements of each contract outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without commission approval section c provides that “the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title” section c protects the expectation of investors that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer and is intended to ensure that unnecessary or burdensome sales loads additional reinvestment costs and other charges will not be incurred due to unapproved substitutions of securities  the proposed substitutions involve a substitution of securities within the meaning of section c of the  act the section  applicants therefore request an order from the commission pursuant to section c approving the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants have reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the contracts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right the section  applicants have reserved this right of substitution both to protect themselves and their contract owners in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a separate account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the insurance companies and their respective contract owners  applicants assert that each replacement portfolio and its corresponding removed portfolio have similar and in some cases substantially similar or identical investment objectives policies and risks in addition the proposed substitutions retain for contract owners the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the contracts according to the applicants any impact on the investment programs of affected contract owners including the appropriateness of the available investment options should therefore be negligible  applicants maintain that the ultimate effect of each substitution would be to remove overlapping and duplicative investment options and that each substitution will permit each insurance company to present information to its contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner applicants anticipate that after each proposed substitution contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their contracts  applicants also state that as a result of each proposed substitution contract owners with subaccount balances invested in each replacement portfolio will have lower net operating expenses each insurance company has agreed to impose a two year expense limit except with respect to the proposed substitutions involving the lord abbett series fund—growth and income portfolio pimco variable insurance trust—real return portfolio and lord abbett series fund—bonddebenture portfolio for which each insurance company has agreed to impose an expense limit for the life of each contract so that the sum of each replacement portfolios net operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio assetbased charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the corresponding removed portfolios net operating expense ratio and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year   applicants contend that therefore each substitution protects the contract owners who have allocated contract value to each removed portfolio by i providing an underlying investment option for subaccounts invested in the removed portfolio that is similar to the removed portfolio ii providing such contract owners with simpler disclosure documents and iii providing such contract owners with an investment option that would have net operating start printed page expenses that are lower than the current investment option  applicants assert that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute investment securities in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to contract owners under their contracts additionally the section  applicants claim that the substitutions will not in any manner reduce the nature or quality of the available investment options moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying contract owners of the proposed substitutions which supplement will be delivered to contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitutions and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution date the substitutions therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent  applicants maintain that the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract contract owners select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their contract values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the section  applicants under the applicable contract as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the contract contract owners also may have considered the insurance companys size financial condition and its reputation for service in selecting their contract these factors will not change as a result of the proposed substitution  section a of the  act prohibits any affiliated person as defined in section a of the  act of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the same persons acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  the section  applicants state that shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company and that the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own substantially all of the shares of eqat accordingly eqat and its respective portfolios are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that the contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if eqat is under the common control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of eqat and its respective portfolios if eqat and its respective portfolios are under the control of the insurance companies then eqat and its respective affiliates are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  the section  applicants note that regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control eqat and its respective portfolios because the insurance companies and their affiliates own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement portfolios investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of eqat and its respective portfolios likewise eqats respective portfolios are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies  in addition to the above the insurance companies through their respective separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of certain of the removed portfolios including the dreyfus variable investment fund—international value portfolio lord abbett series fund—bonddebenture portfolio t rowe price fixed income series inc—prime reserve portfolio old mutual insurance series fund—midcap portfolio and pimco variable insurance trust—real return portfolio therefore each insurance company is an affiliated person of those portfolios  the section  applicants state that the proposed inkind transactions could be seen as the indirect purchase of shares of certain replacement portfolios with portfolio securities of certain removed portfolios and the indirect sale of portfolio securities of certain removed portfolios for shares of certain replacement portfolios pursuant to this analysis the proposed inkind transactions also could be categorized as a purchase of shares of certain replacement portfolios by certain removed portfolios acting as principal and a sale of portfolio securities by certain removed portfolios acting as principal to certain replacement portfolios in addition the proposed inkind transactions could be viewed as a purchase of securities from certain removed portfolios and a sale of securities to certain replacement portfolios by mony or mloa or their separate accounts acting as principal if categorized in this manner the proposed inkind transactions may be deemed to contravene section a due to the affiliated status of these participants  rule a under the  act exempts from the prohibitions of section a subject to certain enumerated conditions a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies or separate series of registered investment companies which are affiliated persons or affiliated persons of affiliated persons of each other between separate series of a registered investment company or between a registered investment company or a separate series of a registered investment company and a person which is an affiliated person of such registered investment company or affiliated person of such person solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of each other common directors andor common officers  mony mloa their separate accounts certain removed portfolios and certain replacement portfolios in connection with their participation in the proposed inkind transactions must rely on that portion of rule a that requires that they be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or affiliated investment advisers common directors andor common officers that is not the case as detailed above moreover one of the conditions enumerated in rule a requires that the transaction be a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are readily available if the proposed inkind transactions are viewed as purchases and sales of securities the consideration in the proposed redemptions of shares of certain removed portfolios and the proposed purchases of shares of certain replacement portfolios would not be cash but would be the portfolio securities received from the removed portfolio  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application issue an order start printed page exempting any proposed transaction from section a if i the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned ii the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and iii the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants request an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind transactions in connection with the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the policies of the relevant removed portfolios and the relevant corresponding replacement portfolios as recited in the current registration statement and reports of the relevant investment company filed with the commission under the federal securities laws finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants state that they will assure themselves that the investment companies will carry out the proposed inkind transactions in conformity with the conditions of rule a or as applicable a removed portfolios and a replacement portfolios normal valuation procedures as set forth in the relevant investment companys registration statement except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash the inkind transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of each removed portfolio and the corresponding replacement portfolio as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the portfolios registration statements and as required by rule c under the  act the inkind transactions will not change the dollar value of any contract owners investment in any of the separate accounts the value of any contract the accumulation value or other value credited to any contract or the death benefit payable under any contract after the proposed inkind transactions the value of a separate accounts investment in a replacement portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the removed portfolio together with the value of any preexisting investments in the replacement portfolio before the inkind transactions  when the commission initially proposed and adopted rule a it noted that the purpose of the rule was to eliminate the filing and processing of applications “in circumstances where there appears to be no likelihood that the statutory finding for a specific exemption under section b could not be made” by establishing “conditions as to the availability of the exemption to those situations where the commission upon the basis of its experience considers that there is no likelihood of overreaching of the investment companies participating in the transaction” when the commission amended rule a in  to cover transactions involving noninvestment company affiliates it indicated that such transactions could be reasonable and fair and not involve overreaching if appropriate conditions were imposed on the transaction in this regard the section  applicants state they will assure themselves that the inkind transactions will be in substantial compliance with the conditions of rule a under the  act the section  applicants assert that because the proposed inkind transactions would comply in substance with the principal conditions of rule a the commission should consider the extent to which the inkind transactions would meet these or other similar conditions and issue an order if such conditions would provide the substance of the protections embodied in rule a  the section  applicants state that the proposed inkind transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio securities as specified in paragraph b of rule a the proposed inkind transactions will comply with paragraph d of rule a because no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration except for any customary transfer fees will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed inkind transactions furthermore a written record of the proposed inkind transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with paragraph g of rule a with respect to those securities for which market quotations are not readily available the substitutions will be effected in accordance with the relevant removed portfolios and the relevant corresponding replacement portfolios normal valuation procedures as set forth in the registration statement for the relevant investment company  even though the proposed inkind transactions will not comply with the cash consideration requirement of paragraph a of rule a the section  applicants state that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions will offer to each of the relevant removed portfolios and each of the relevant replacement portfolios the same degree of protection from overreaching that rule a generally provides in connection with the purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of business in particular the insurance companies and their affiliates cannot effect the proposed inkind transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any replacement portfolio  the section  applicants represent that the proposed redemption of shares of each of the relevant removed portfolios will be consistent with the investment policies of each removed portfolio and the corresponding replacement portfolio as recited in their respective current registration statements provided that the shares are redeemed at their net asset value in conformity with rule c under the  act likewise the proposed sale of shares of each of the relevant replacement portfolios for investment securities is consistent with the investment policies of the relevant replacement portfolio as recited in the relevant trusts registration statement provided that i the shares are sold at their net asset value and ii the investment securities are of the type and quality that a replacement portfolio could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash to assure the second of these conditions is met the manager and relevant adviser will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement portfolio and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such portfolio in a cash transaction  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act and that the proposed inkind transactions do not present any conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent in particular sections b and b of the  act state among other things that the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected “when investment companies are organized operated managed or their portfolio securities are selected in the start printed page interest of directors officers investment advisers depositors or other affiliated persons thereof    or in the interest of other investment companies or persons engaged in other lines of business rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies security holders    when investment companies issue securities containing inequitable or discriminatory provisions or fail to protect the preferences and privileges of holders in their outstanding securities” as explained above the terms of the proposed inkind transactions are designed to prevent the abuses described in sections b and b of the  act  the section  applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the terms of the proposed inkind transactions as set forth in the application including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair to i each of the relevant replacement portfolios and each of the relevant removed portfolios and ii contract owners the section  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned furthermore the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind transactions are or will be consistent with all relevant policies of i the relevant replacement portfolios and the relevant removed portfolios as stated in the relevant investment companys registration statement and reports filed under the  act and ii the general purposes of the  act conclusion for the reasons set forth in the application the section  applicants and the section  applicants respectively state that the proposed substitutions and the related inkind transactions meet the standards of section c of the  act and of section b of the  act and request that the
