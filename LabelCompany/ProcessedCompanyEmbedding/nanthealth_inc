false reporting or be distracted by false claims both an online health trade publication and an online political publication published articles containing numerous inaccuracies letters we wrote to these publications pointing out those inaccuracies are posted on nanthealth’s website as just one example the reporter stated that nantworks purchased the jefferson property from the foundation for  million that statement is false what is worse the reporter had the facts before he published the article that nantworks in fact paid m yet he published a false statement of apparent selfdealing by nantworks by stating a fabricated amount of m the written statement the reporter sent to dr soonshiong in his interview before the story published demonstrated this fact he wrote “according to our review of your form s the nanthealth foundation sold nearly  million in assets to nantworks llc” which clearly demonstrates that he knew he was publishing a false number thus the reporter was well aware and understood the false and defamatory implication of what he wrote the reporter’s assertion that nantworks paid m is also belied as can be seen in the foundations publicly viewable tax returns the foundation sold the  jefferson property in may  to nantworks for  the price was based on two appraisals which came in within  of each other by unaffiliated and wellregarded real estate appraisal firms upon advice of counsel the disinterested foundation directors decided to sell the real estate to nantworks at the median price between the two appraisals dr soonshiong did not participate in the directors’ decision rather he disclosed his conflict to the foundation’s board and recused himself from the meeting before the vote we demanded a retraction and correction but so far the editors

false reporting or be distracted by false claims both an online health trade publication and an online political publication published articles containing numerous inaccuracies letters we wrote to these publications pointing out those inaccuracies are posted on nanthealth’s website as just one example the reporter stated that nantworks purchased the jefferson property from the foundation for  million that statement is false what is worse the reporter had the facts before he published the article that nantworks in fact paid m yet he published a false statement of apparent selfdealing by nantworks by stating a fabricated amount of m the written statement the reporter sent to dr soonshiong in his interview before the story published demonstrated this fact he wrote “according to our review of your form s the nanthealth foundation sold nearly  million in assets to nantworks llc” which clearly demonstrates that he knew he was publishing a false number thus the reporter was well aware and understood the false and defamatory implication of what he wrote the reporter’s assertion that nantworks paid m is also belied as can be seen in the foundations publicly viewable tax returns the foundation sold the  jefferson property in may  to nantworks for  the price was based on two appraisals which came in within  of each other by unaffiliated and wellregarded real estate appraisal firms upon advice of counsel the disinterested foundation directors decided to sell the real estate to nantworks at the median price between the two appraisals dr soonshiong did not participate in the directors’ decision rather he disclosed his conflict to the foundation’s board and recused himself from the meeting before the vote we demanded a retraction and correction but so far the editors
