hypothetical capital allocation to such strategy hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations some of which are described below no representation is being made that any particular trading program will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program one of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight in addition hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading for example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results there are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results although the information in this communication is believed to be materially correct as at the date of issue no representation or warranty is given as to the

requirements relating to such investments some or all alternative investment programs may not be suitable for certain investors among the risks we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following  each funds investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks  the investments of each fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holder’s investment which could equal the total amount invested  as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the funds it may be difficult or impossible for a fund to obtain complete andor reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed  the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and consequently higher risk and may depend upon the services of key personnel and if certain or all of them become unavailable the funds may prematurely terminate  an investment in a fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a fund and none is expected to develop  there are restrictions on transferring interests in a fund  sil and its affiliates may receive performancebased compensation which may result in riskier investments and the funds’ fees may offset trading profits  the funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest  certain securities and instruments in which the funds may invest can be highly volatile  the funds may be leveraged  a substantial portion of the trades executed for the funds take place on nonus exchanges  changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value price or income of the investments of each fund

limitations some of which are described below no representation is being made that any particular trading program will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program one of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight in addition hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading for example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results there are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully

we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following  each funds investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks  the investments of each fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holder’s investment which could equal the total amount invested  as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the funds it may be difficult or impossible for a fund to obtain complete andor reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed  the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and consequently higher risk and may depend upon the services of key personnel and if certain or all of them become unavailable the funds may prematurely terminate  an investment in a fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a fund and none is expected to develop  there are restrictions on transferring interests in a fund  sil and its affiliates may receive performancebased compensation which may result in riskier investments and the funds’ fees may offset trading profits  the funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest  certain securities and instruments in which the funds may invest can be highly volatile  the funds may be leveraged  a substantial portion of the trades executed for the funds take place on nonus exchanges  changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value price or income of the investments of each fund and  the funds are not mutual funds pursuant to and therefore not subject to regulation under the investment company act i agree i dont agree disclosure deutsche

can be no assurance that an alternative funds stated objectives will be met summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more morningstar® snapshot as

average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other
