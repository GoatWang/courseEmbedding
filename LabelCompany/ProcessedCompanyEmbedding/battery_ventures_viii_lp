battery will have up to  of the power of a brand new unit but this is more than your car needs all you need to do is to follow these simple steps you will need distilled water voltmeter battery charger and syringe  remove the battery and remove the rubber that protects the caps then remove the caps as well some batteries may have  caps but some may have more or less it is mandatory to remove all of them  fill a battery with the distilled water and recharge it keep in mind that you shouldn’t put the caps back place the battery on a charger and charge it for one houryou should see bubbles on the holes if there are no bubbles reverse the negative and positive wires and wait for  minutes you should see the bubbles now reverse the wires to the correct position and recharge the battery for additional  minutes  you can also try to replace the acid inside a battery and mix a new acid with the distilled water then recharge the battery for a few hours in any case you will get a new battery that can last for a long time want proven and  working method  try follow this video  battery companies pray you never see this revealing video… how to recondition a laptop battery laptop battery reconditioning is more than just possible and there are a lot of different ways to achieve that but some of them may be time consuming in any case it is the best choice to try simply because a new laptop battery is expensive and it may cost more than a new laptop on the other side all of these ways are simple and you can do them by yourself laptops that have removable batteries are much simpler to do this but you can try these steps on laptops with nonremovable batteries in addition do not use these solutions on a new battery simply because this will have a negative effect and they will get damaged in any case you can recondition an old battery and you will be able to use that laptop for a lot more time the best part is that all solutions cost nothing solution  remove a battery from your laptop and place it is a plastic bag place it in a freezer and wait for  hours then remove it from the bag and clean it place it in a laptop and fully recharge it if the battery is not leaking there is no acid around it this way will be successful in any case you will end up with a new battery that can last for a long time in addition you can repeat the procedure a few times solution  some laptops must be ‘’reset’’ in order to get better battery life this is a very simple solution but it isn’t very successful in fact it is more about recalibrating a laptop than to reconditioning a battery on the other side most people have said that this is an effective solution recharge the battery until it is  full and leave the laptop for  hours now leave the laptop unplugged and wait until the battery is completely empty and your laptop is turned off leave it in this state for  hours recharge the battery until it is  full it is known that this solution increases the battery life and will make your laptop get more accurate info about the battery levels solution  reducing the temperature of your laptop seems to have a positive effect on the battery life all you need to do is to buy the cooler and place a laptop on it this will reduce the temperature of the battery and the laptop so the battery will last longer during the warmer months this is an even better thing to do solution  best one – recommended video  do this to bring any old battery back to life – just like new solution  this method is more than just effective but it is a time consuming process in any case you will have to plug in the battery and wait until it is  full then wait until it is almost empty about  then plug it in again and recharge it again repeat the procedure several times until you get a reconditioned battery solution  this solution may sound weird but it is very simple also it is only possible if your laptop has a removable battery you will have to plug a laptop and leaver it charge when the battery is completely full remove the battery from a laptop if your laptop cannot function without a battery this procedure won’t be effective on the other side if it can the battery life will be extended this is possible due to the fact when you do it you will stop the chemical process in the battery and you will reset it as the end result your battery will be able to recharge a lot better and stay full for a longer period of time recondition nicad batteries you should know that nicad batteries can be reconditioned as well however first you should know why they get damaged this happens due to the sulfur crystals that eventually reach both terminals and it prevents charging this can be solved so your batteries will last for a long time in addition the procedure is more than just simple don’t buy  new battery – do this instead video you are going to need the flash camera capacitor there are a lot of cheap cameras of this type that you can disassemble and use their parts you will know what a capacitor is due to the fact it is a big cylinder part add a battery holder and a switch to the capacitor stick the wires to the big black cylinder and connect them with the battery holder and a switch make sure all wires are insulated and they don’t touch anything that can conduct electricity place an alkaline battery into the capacitor and the nicad battery into the holder you added before then press the switch and wait the led to glow then repeat the step keep in mind that you should hear a sound that’s meansthat the sulfur crystals are destroyed and your battery can be used again once you make this ‘’gadget’’ you can use it for reconditioning nicad batteries for ever it may sound complicated but it is very simple and you cannot make a mistake in addition it is possible to buy a capacitor for this application but it is too much expensive and it won’t do the job better than this device how to recondition lead acid batteries lead acid batteries are expensive so reconditioning one is a better choice than to buy a new one at the same time it is possible to fix an old battery and get several more years from it in any case this is a simple procedure but it may be dangerous due to the fact the acid can be dangerous in any case you will have to follow the next steps video bring your old batteries back to life instead of buying new ones remove the battery and open the caps some batteries have rubber protection but you can easily remove it as well remove all the caps and do not place them back until you are done  in most cases a battery won’t have enough distilled water and this is the main issue in that case add the distilled water and recharge the battery once again do not place the caps back keep in mind that the battery must have between  and  volts when you measure it with a voltmeter  if this doesn’t solve the problem you can try a more aggressive method you should get an acid pack and replace the acid and add new distiller water in that case repeat the procedure with charging and you should get a new battery don’t forget that the charging battery should be between  and  hours if you use a slow charger on the other side if you use a quick charger you can recharge it in less than  hours it is a much better choice to measure the battery levels with a voltmeter while charging in order to get the best results keep in mind that this type of acid can be dangerous so it isn’t a very safe procedure but you can manage it and be completely protected if you wear goggles and gloves the situation is the same if you are planning to completely replace the battery acid in some cases if the battery cells are damaged you won’t get the  capacity from the battery as when it was new on the other side you will get more than  of the power the battery had when it was new this is enough for most batteries simply because it is enough power for their applications learning yourself how to recondition batteries will have a positive effect on the environment and the planet in general at the same time you will save money and you will be able to prolong the life of your batteries on the other side all these procedures are
