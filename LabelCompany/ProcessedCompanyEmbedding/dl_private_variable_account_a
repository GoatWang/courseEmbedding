explanations exercises problems and calculators variable costing versus absorption costing posted in variable and absorption costing explanations explain the difference between variable and absorption costing how unit product cost is computed under two methods variable and absorption are two different costing methods almost all successful companies in the world use both the methods variable costing and absorption costing cannot be substituted for one another because both the systems have their own benefits and limitations these costing approaches are known by various names for example variable costing is also known as direct costing or marginal costing and absorption costing is also known as full costing or traditional costing the information provided by variable costing method is mostly used by internal management for decision making purposes absorption costing provides information that is used by internal management as well as by external parties like creditors government agencies and auditors etc computation of unit product cost under two methods under absorption costing system the product cost consists of all variable as well as all fixed manufacturing costs ie direct materials direct labor and factory overhead foh but when variable costing system is used the fixed cost both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing is treated as a period or capacity cost and is therefore not included in the product cost following exhibition summarizes the difference between variable costing and absorption costing variable versus absorption costing for further clarification of the concept consider the following examples example  a company manufactures and sells  units of product x per year  suppose one unit of product x requires the following costs direct materials  per unit direct labor  per unit variable manufacturing overhead  per unit fixed manufacturing overhead  per year the unit product cost of the company is computed as follows absorption costing          variable costing            notice that the fixed manufacturing overhead cost has not been included in the unit cost under variable costing system but it has been included in the unit cost under absorption costing system this is the primary difference between variable and absorption costing example  sunshine company produces and sells only washing machines the company uses variable costing for internal reporting and absorption costing for external reporting the data  for the year 6 is given below direct materials unit direct labor unit variable manufacturing overhead unit fixed manufacturing overhead 6 per year fixed marketing and administrative expenses  per year variable marketing and administrative expenses unit sold company produced and sold  machines during the year 6 required compute the unite product cost under variable costing and absorption costing solution 6   units   note marketing and administrative expenses are period costs and are not relevant in the computation of unit product cost next  thoughts on variable costing versus absorption costing zaheer yes it is useful reply kat i could have used a little more explanation of the variable costing method however this was useful reply stewie why is marketing and administrative expenses not relevant in the second example reply yolly they are period cost in both method not included in the computation of product cost reply accounting for management because they are not incurred to manufacture a product in example  we are computing unit product cost not net operating income read this article

fall in product cost in marginal costing correct me if i am wrong reply marwah can you please explains why absorption includes fixed costs explains effect of ending inventory on operating income clear on results of production more than sales sales more than production and sales equals production reply e who is the author for this page for citation purposes thanks reply lia is powdercoating treated

than variable costing if not which one is correct statement and how about fixed overhead expenses under which method has always higher fixed overhead expenses thanks reply queenscommerce as much as this is useful can we conclude that in the long run total costs incurred will be the same under a fifo method i know that using one or the other can maximize net income but my question has to do with the long term nature of the cost if anyone can answer this it would be unreal thanks reply oprae ncube please help me solve this bindu ltd is a manufacturing company and has provided you with the
