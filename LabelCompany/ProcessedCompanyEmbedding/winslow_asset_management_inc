busted ipo’s spinoffs out of favor stocks and underappreciated stocks with limited wall street coverage with annual turnover of approximately  our goal is to find up to ten exceptional new investment ideas per year comprehensive analysis a process where art and science converge our focus is on business drivers understanding a business is not as simple as “what does this company do” or as detailed as “how many units will this company sell to the rural markets in western brazil this quarter” in the global economy there are many complex forces that determine the success of a business and we seek to truly understand the ones that matter for the longterm what gives the company competitive advantages over its competition why are these advantages sustainable we use a combination of research and intuition as the foundation of our investment process management before investing in a company we conduct our version of “detective work”  focused on management’s credibility and ability to execute  we use historical archived conference calls to gain a  perspective rather than only getting the current “story” from the investor relations department or meeting management for the first time  management execution is especially important in smallcap stocks in our opinion accounting for up to  of their success financials we look to uncover assets trading below our perception of their intrinsic value based on potential catalysts we expect to develop  balance sheet strength cash flow and sustainable revenue growth are also key ingredients to identifying a winslow stock    valuation by eliminating the potential manipulation of earnings the price to sales metric has been a very successful tool for assessing a company’s valuation  we review price to sales as well as other typical metrics and view them relative to a company’s history and the specific sector or industry  through our valuation work we are able to purchase companies at prices with an imbedded margin of safety   portfolio construction  risk controls build a diversified portfolio using an incremental approach both equity strategies are diversified by sector exposure yet remain concentrated enough to provide the best chance for outperformance  the allcap strategy invests in  holdings with a  maximum individual stock weighting risk control while the smallcap strategy invests in  holdings with a  maximum individual stock weighting limit  while some allcap managers merely have the ability to invest across the market capitalization spectrum our clients benefit by having a minimum of  and a maximum of  in each market capitalization category at all times  sell discipline sell when expectations are high or investment story has changed companies are sold when the position size becomes too large financial metrics are no longer attractive price targets have been met business fundamentals have changed or a better investment idea is identified in addition our stocks  have been taken over by larger companies or private equity firms investment philosophy our philosophy our process investment recap winslow asset management is an independent  employeeowned investment firm based in cleveland

customizable equity and balanced strategies for high net worth investors we manage equity strategies and balanced strategies which are a blend of holdings based on the risk profile and liquidity needs of each client  approximately half of our individual clients utilize winslow as the sole asset manager for their entire liquid net worth in these instances we work with the client to determine the appropriate allocation of stocks bonds and cash to meet their short and longterm needs  the other half of our high net worth clients utilize winslow in a multimanager environment where we compliment the investment stylesobjectives of their other asset managers sometimes with the partnership of an outside investment consultant  given the flexible and opportunistic nature of our allcap strategy winslow provides a welldiversified core equity option  the smallcap strategy is suitable for individuals with a greater risk tolerance and a willingness to withstand additional market volatility while looking  for higher longterm returns a focus on asset management we are not all things to all people our team focuses on our niche which is picking stocks and providing exceptional long term investment performance for our clients   it is just as important to understand what we don’t do as it is to know what we do best  adding noncore functions to a “menu of services” would be a distraction rather than a benefit to our clients   we understand that a comprehensive financial plan goes beyond asset management  that is why we collaborate with our clients’ other partners such as tax and estate attorneys accountants and family offices or investment consultants to make sure that together we bring best in class services to our clients a personal touch we provide high quality investment options with the personal touch to high net worth clients  with an intentionally low clientportfolio manager ratio of  we by design are accessible  our clients can tailor the frequency and

process investment recap investment productsallcap core smallcap core balanced our team our philosophy research driven at winslow we have a firm culture which embraces a consistent and repeatable process we look to identify low expectation stocks that are either underfollowed by traditional sellside firms or  unloved by the market we strive to understand our companies and what drives them better than our peers identifying catalysts before they develop is a key component to our process evaluating a management team’s ability to execute is especially critical in the smallcap space contrarian our longterm experience investing in value stocks and our contrarian mindset makes us predisposed to run toward fires not away from them additionally our  year investment horizon allows us to arbitrage time and take advantage of  shortterm market volatility we are students of the concepts of behavioral finance and utilize this philosophy throughout our research process our midwest location and roots also provide a unique perspective avoiding the herd mentality often found on wall street  while we embrace the scientific models and metrics used in evaluating companieswe believe that this approach must be combined with the artistic aspects of picking good investments core with a value tilt we are always looking for good companies or those that can become good companies we just prefer to buy them when others don’t perceive them favorably allowing us to opportunistically purchase these mispriced investments with the most upside potential we firmly believe that at an inflated price even the best company is a poor investment yet at a depressed price even a perceived “junky” company can be a great investment      investment philosophy our philosophy our process
