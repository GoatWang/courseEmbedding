bond of the silver ion in sdc allows the silver ion to remain in solution while at the same time making it more bioavailable for antimicrobial action mode of action       sdc kills microorganisms by two modes of action  the silver ion deactivates structural and metabolic membrane proteins leading to microbial death  the microbes view sdc as a food source allowing the silver ion to enter the
