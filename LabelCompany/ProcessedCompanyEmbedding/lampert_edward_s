esl investments it hasn’t failed but may be setting a benchmark for slow painful declines thanks to its outsize longterm bet on two venerable retailers sears and kmartlast week sears holdings the parent company said what was becoming increasingly obvious to most investors not to mention anyone who’s been in a sears store lately “substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”sears said that the statement reflected a new more stringent accounting rule and that the company was in no imminent danger of bankruptcy “we are a viable business that can

sears a long time to die” said greg melich senior managing director and head of consumer research for evercore and the last wall street analyst still covering sears “it’s been burning through over a billion dollars in cash every year that’s not sustainable”sears holdings has long been esl’s largest investment along with other sears assets mr lampert spun off such as the struggling lands’ end the two holdings accounted for nearly half the fund’s holdings at the end of the year according to its most recent securities filings sears holdings shares were  in  this week they were barely above few hedge fund managers have been as celebrated as mr lampert in his heyday which now appears to be the mids mr lampert was a wall street wunderkind a goldman sachs intern whose intellect ingratiating personality and prodigious work ethic attracted the patronage of some of america’s most prominent and successful investors robert rubin mr lampert’s mentor at goldman richard rainwater who invested for the billionaire bass brothers before starting his own firm and david geffen the billionaire entertainment mogulmr lampert was  years old and at the vanguard of the hedge fund movement when he founded esl in  with  million in seed money from mr rainwater the change in sears share price from  to the beginning of this week just three years later he was the subject of a frontpage profile in the wall street journal he reaped even more publicity after he was kidnapped at gunpoint in  and held hostage in a days inn before talking his way to freedom by  esl’s spectacular  percent annualized returns landed him on the cover of businessweek magazinebesides mr rainwater and mr geffen his highprofile investors included michael dell members of the ziff publishing family and thomas j tisch a philanthropist and heir to the tisch family fortune in  forbes ranked him no  on its list of the  richest americans with a net worth of  billion a few notches ahead of another retailing executive jeff bezos of amazon he was widely hailed as another warren buffett only perhaps even smarter “eddie is one of the extraordinary investors of our age if not the most extraordinary” mr tisch told businessweekno one compares mr lampert to mr buffett anymore his highprofile investors are for the most part long gone mr tisch who’s also a director of sears is described as steadfastly loyal steven mnuchin mr lampert’s roommate at yale and now treasury secretary disclosed last year that he had a  million investment in esl mr mnuchin said he would divest the position advertisement continue reading the main story notably a group of goldman sachs clients who had invested  billion in  bailed out of the fund in  their exit “pretty much says it all” as far as investor confidence in mr lampert goes mr melich saidwhere did someone as smart successful and hardworking as mr lampert go wrong his initial concept to combine two iconic but deeply distressed retailers — kmart and sears — initially appealed to many investors as a classic investment in undervalued poorly managed assets in the warren buffett style but mr buffett doesn’t personally manage his portfolio companies several former lampert investors told me that mr lampert’s fundamental mistake was one common to many oncesuccessful hedge fund managers hubris and the belief that investment prowess would translate into management skill“he was a very successful investor before he took over kmart and sears” said mark cohen former chief executive of sears canada and a professor at columbia business school where he’s the director of retail studies mr cohen left sears canada before mr lampert arrived“he seemed to think he was smarter than anyone in the retail business but he had no idea how to run the company from day ” mr cohen said “one thing i teach is that core competencies are the basis for success or failure lampert had no experience in retail and no management competency whatsoever” newsletter sign up

the last decade by forces beyond mr lampert’s control especially the rise of internet retailing mr lampert claims to have foreseen the trend if so he’s had scant success carrying out a strategy to deal with ithis one consistent approach over the years has been to cut costs drastically initially it seemed to work increasing cash flow and earnings “there’s a philosophy to that” mr melich said but sears “grossly underinvested in areas that proved to be very relevant to the future of merchandising such as multichannel retailing”he pointed to the contrast between sears and home depot whose shares have nearly tripled in the last five years despite the internet and competition from amazon photo edward s lampert in  he was at the vanguard of the hedge fund movement when he started esl in  credit vincent laforetthe new york times mr lampert has shown more prowess as a financial engineer and has seemingly squeezed sears’s once formidable assets for every penny of value through a continuing series of asset sales spinoffs dividend payouts and loans secured by sears assets mr lampert has emphasized that because he is sears’s largest shareholder his interests are aligned with other sears shareholdersbut the perception persists that many of these deals have benefited mr lampert more than shareholders since he’s often on both sides of the transactions advertisement continue reading the main story over the last two years alone mr lampert and esl have extended sears over  million in loans secured by sears assets — nearly twothirds as much as sears’s entire market capitalization of  billion that makes mr lampert and esl the largest sears creditors giving them vastly different interests than most shareholders esl investments holds  percent of sears holdings’s equity and  percent of its total longterm debt as creditors they could end up owning sears if it reorganizes in bankruptcy while other sears shareholders would be wiped outlast month mr lampert and the sears board agreed to pay  million to settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming that sears’s sale and leaseback of much of its most valuable real estate to a real estate investment trust —  percent owned by mr lampert and his esl hedge fund — was a blatant conflict of interest that harmed sears shareholders sears has denied any wrongdoing and said it had settled the suit merely to avoid “protracted litigation”mr lampert “has stripped sears of its assets” mr cohen said “it’s the longest liquidation in retail history his reputation in the retail community is that he’s a financial pirate”like most hedge fund managers mr lampert continues to get a management fee no matter how poorly the fund’s assets performstill sears’s travails and their impact on esl’s results have clearly taken a toll on mr lampert’s own fortunes although mr lampert probably shows substantial gains on his original investment in sears and kmart “he and esl investors can’t have fared very well over the past six or seven years” mr melich saidmr lampert remains one of the country’s richest people he owns lavish homes in greenwich conn aspen colo and miami as well as a foot yacht fountainhead named after the ayn rand novel mr lampert is a devotee of the author last year forbes ranked him tied for no  on its annual list of the  richest americans with a net worth of  billionbut that’s a billionandahalf dollars less than forbes estimated back in  since then mr bezos has vaulted to no  on the forbes list just behind bill gates with a net worth of  billion had mr lampert simply put his fortune in a stock market index fund rather than gaining control of sears and kmart he would have fared far betterthrough a spokesman mr lampert declined to commenteven his critics concede that mr lampert has been stubbornly consistent refusing to throw in the towel on sears even after years of deteriorating results in a news release last week he showed no signs of backing down pledging yet another “fundamental restructuring” of searshis strategy cutting “at least  billion in costs on an annualized basis” correction march   an earlier version of this column misstated the management fee charged by esl

print order reprint of this story walk into a sears these days and you’ll see an icon of american retailing collapsing before your eyes on a may visit to the falls church virginia store the floors in the refrigerator aisles were splotched with brown stains over by the exercise equipment the walls were scuffed and had wires hanging out of them there were empty shelves in the shoe department and in the tools section and the men’s clothing area the place is in decay — much like sears’s oncedominant business model after six straight years of plunging sales and profit losses the company is shuttering stores and selling off crown jewels like its craftsman tools line decades of missed opportunities have brought sears to this it lost its focus with ventures into discover credit cards and coldwell banker real estate in an attempt to diversify then big boxes such as home depot and best buy chipped away at lucrative product niches but maybe the biggest whiff executives knew as far back as the early s that they had to wean sears off its dependency on shopping malls — but its many forays into other store formats never quite worked as ecommerce moves toward its golden age sears is an

in this war of attrition chief executive indian creek village’s edward s lampert has said “we’re fighting like hell” lampert a controversial hedge fund billionaire has invested heavily in bolstering sears’s internet business but has let the retail stores languish he’s now propping up the company with loans and other feats of financial engineering — moves that may soften his landing if the chain fails the trouble at sears “represents the loss of this long arc of retail history” said vicki howard a historian at university of essex in britain who has written a book about department stores “it does seem quite dire it does seem like we’re at some kind of turning point” an employee prepares to lock up for the night at the sears on leesburg pike in falls church virginia the washington post allison shelley sears is hardly alone retailers have announced the closures of more than  stores this year alone big retail is on pace to see more bankruptcies in  than in any year since the great recession according to research by the consultancy alixpartners “the past year will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for ‘brick and mortar’ retailers — and our company was one of the many affected by these headwinds” lampert wrote in a blog post in may lampert has acknowledged that vendors are getting nervous about doing business with sears in may the retailer filed a lawsuit against a tool supplier that it believes is “trying to take advantage of negative rumors” to get out of a contract related stories from miami herald sears and south florida keep a close relationship sears dismisses the idea that it has run out of options the company says it is confident in its financial position and is pushing forward with a turnaround plan even as it acknowledged in a march regulatory filing that there is “substantial doubt” as to whether it can survive “the folks who are playing taps at our funeral we’re not in the box” said chris brathwaite a company spokesman company’s roots sears in many ways created the blueprint for shopping as we know it sears roebuck  co began in the th century as a mailorder business for selling watches and quickly grew into a catalog that sold saddles sewing machines and buggies to a largely rural nation the prices were low and the selection was vast — a model made possible as the rampup of mass production was making it cheaper and quicker than ever to churn out goods montgomery ward and rh macy  co already had flourishing catalog businesses by the time richard sears got in the game but he quickly found an audience thanks to his flair for cooking up promotions that shoppers went wild for sometimes they were too good to be true the  sears roebuck catalog promised a men’s suit for  saying it was an “unheard of price” for its quality the deluge of interest left sears’s merchants scrambling unsuccessfully to find enough suits to fill the orders where america went sears followed as consumers migrated into urban and later suburban areas sears swooped in and built an empire of department stores sears in many ways created the blueprint for shopping as we know it in  a visionary executive named robert e wood pushed the company to open its first outpost wood gambled that these emporiums would appeal to consumers who were discovering the new mobility that came with the automobile within four years sears had  stores and it could hardly open them fast enough by  store purchases accounted for a bigger share of its sales than the catalog did sears became the country’s largest most powerful retailer generations of shoppers outfitted their homes with its craftsman tools and kenmore appliances they dragged their children there to buy backtoschool clothes and first communion outfits those kids built their christmas lists by paging through its holiday wish book for a time sears sold cars it even sold houses if shopping in america had a collective consciousness sears was its centerpiece by the s  out of every  working americans was employed by sears it was pumping out  million catalogs a year making it america’s largest publisher “sears was regarded as a national institution almost like the post office” said gordon l weil a writer who chronicled the history of sears in a  book “everybody went there everybody did business with them everybody believed they were a permanent part of the landscape” jim hicks a retiree living in atlanta was one of those loyal customers the yearold remembers that his dad took him to sears in  to buy two new suits a gesture of kindness when money was tight for him as a seminary student about  years ago he had sears technicians install a kenmore washer and dryer in his home “they’re still working” hicks said “and no one’s done a lick of work to them” and then there was the sears tools department where hicks said he was “like a kid in the candy store” a handpowered drill he bought there helped him build the  foot rowboat that he took on countless fishing excursions to georgia lakes and marshes his soldering gun his saw his ratchet wrench they all come from sears portfolio broadens by the early s the portfolio of sears had grown to include discover coldwell banker and stock brokerage firm dean witter reynolds financial services businesses that it hoped would provide more diverse revenue streams but ultimately they became distractions from the core retailing business when sears posted a loss of nearly  billion in  investors began worrying about its durability steven kirn recalled what it was like when he joined the company a year later as a senior humanresources executive and spent time traveling the country to visit sears stores to get a feel for the business “the morale was so low” kirn said when store employees went on break and ventured out to the mall food court “they would take off their sears name tag so no one would know where they were from that’s pretty grim” and then came those “softer side of sears” commercials the ads had an earworm of a jingle and featured fashionistas ambling along the beach in a cozy coat or twirling in a sparkly cocktail dress the message was clear sears is not just a place to stock a toolbox the campaign was part of a broader turnaround strategy hatched by arthur martinez an executive who took the helm of the sears retail division in late  his idea was simple women were the primary shopping decisionmakers in most american households and sears was not doing enough to win them over martinez made other key moves to nurse sears back to health he axed the catalog which by then was losing more than  million a year the company sold off its gleaming sears tower headquarters in chicago and those distracting financial services businesses it also parted ways with allstate the insurance provider that it had created back in  it was a shot in the arm but it only lasted so long martinez began steering sears to focus on new retailing formats that were aimed at reducing the store’s dependency on shopping malls including sears hardware stores orchard supply hardware stores and the great indoors but none of those provided salvation — and in some cases just created new competition for its existing department stores sears hometown and outlet stores was spun off as a separate public company in  a sign giving information on a sale is displayed at a sears location in ottawa ontario canada on thursday june  sean kilpatrick ap steve dennis a former sears executive who worked on its deals strategies in the s said the company studied whether it could buy its way to success by scooping up a home improvement bigbox store he said they looked at buying builder’s square but ultimately concluded they were late to what was already a “twohorse game” between home depot and lowe’s “there are plenty of examples along the way where sears just missed some pretty profound changes” dennis said “unfortunately i think for the most part the die was cast by the mid’s” a new brand after martinez retired in  chief executive alan lacy pushed forward with the idea to wean sears off the suburban shopping mall by creating a brand called sears grand a concept that was something of a hybrid between a department store and walmart but at a pace of  to  sears grand stores a year it was too little too late by  it was hedge fund chief lampert’s turn to try to revive the chain he engineered a takeover of sears by kmart another troubled retailer at the time the deal had the media asking whether lampert might be the next warren buffett a genius investor who could resurrect the venerable chain by turning it into a powerful conglomerate lampert undertook a number of initiatives including shop your way a rewards program in which shoppers earn points by spending money at sears kmart and tens of thousands of partner businesses its goal is to turn sears into a more membershipcentric retailer the company says the program has “tens of millions of active members and that nearly threequarters of its business is driven by it lampert also slashed costs and put more resources toward building sears’s online shopping firepower but even so that is another area that the retailer has struggled to get right a former ecommerce executive recalled that from  to  the sears and kmart websites went down for hours at a time on black friday and cyber monday — and they just expected those kinds of outages on the biggest shopping days of the year sears at  sw nd st coral gables early thursday sears is closing its aventura store in midjuly in the main florida so far has escaped the growing loss of traditional retail jobs nationwide “in south florida shopping is a part of the tourism experience” sean snaith university of central florida economist told the sunsentinel in may cm guerrero cmguerreroelnuevoheraldcom some critics say lampert just does not have a merchant’s instinct one former senior executive for example remembers being puzzled when lampert wanted to start selling appliances in kmart stores customer research showed that most kmart shoppers were renters not homeowners so why would they spring for ovens and refrigerators lampert’s tenure has seen a revolving door at the highest levels of management several former sears executives say that stores have suffered because lampert did not pour more money into their maintenance or growth lampert himself has lamented the sluggish progress “if we were making a meaningful amount of money it would enable us to move much faster in our transformation” lampert said in a recent interview with the chicago tribune lampert’s role amid sears’s recent spate of troubles lampert has thrown the company several lifelines a real estate investment trust he chairs seritage growth properties paid  billion in  to acquire more than  stores and other real estate owned by sears holdings the deal gave sears a fresh infusion of cash and the retailer entered into a saleleaseback arrangement that allowed it to continue operating stores in those locations sears was regarded as a national institution almost like the post office everybody went there everybody did business with them everybody believed they were a permanent part of the landscape gordon l weil who chronicled the history of sears in a  book in addition lampert’s hedge fund esl investments has provided loans to sears holdings including one for  million announced earlier this year so in addition to being the chief executive and major shareholder of sears lampert is also effectively a major creditor and that means that he may have found a way to lessen his financial pain should the company go into bankruptcy — even as jobs disappear and stores close “i’ve never seen a company that was financed like this and i’ve looked at the capital structure of thousands of companies” said jared ellias a professor at the university of california’s hastings college of the law who studies corporate bankruptcies as of march  lampert controlled about  percent of shares of sears holdings experts say that if the company were to file for bankruptcy those shares as well as those of other shareholders would probably be wiped out however experts say esl could be buffered by the fact that it is a secured creditor of sears the type that typically fares better in a bankruptcy proceeding but it might not turn out to be that simple fellow creditors could bring up issues in bankruptcy proceedings that could undermine lampert’s ultimate financial standing in search of profits it is possible that those financial scenarios never come to pass as sears works through its transformation plan which includes making the shop your way program even more valuable to members lampert has blamed the media for much of the negativity surrounding the company “people are shopping us to the tune of  billion in revenue” said brathwaite the sears spokesman “clearly we mean something to a lot of people and so what we’re trying to do is make ourselves profitable” the retailer still has a substantial market share in the appliances category trailing only lowe’s and home depot technicians in its home services business make some  million service calls a year offering an opportunity to establish and deepen customer relationships there are plenty of examples along the way where sears just missed some pretty profound changes unfortunately i think for the most part the die was cast by the mid’s steve dennis a former sears executive who worked on its deals strategies in the s when asked about the condition of the store in falls church a spokesman said they are working to spiff up the store in the hope that business picks up there “because of sears and kmart’s longstanding history and cultural impact we are targeted for criticism when our results are poor” lampert said in a  letter to shareholders “but it is unfair to evaluate our approach through the rearview mirror without acknowledging the changing circumstances in our industry as well as our bold attempts to change the way we do business to meet this changing reality” but others are not so sure the chicago tribune has reported that by early september sears will close  k mart and  sears stores according to a source close to the company after shuttering  in the first quarter of this year “you’re not going to be able to reverse sears i’m not sure there’s much left to reverse” said michael lisicky an author who has chronicled the history of department stores kirn now a professor at the university of florida said he recently asked his students whether they have shopped at sears in the past year zero hands went up “they don’t have any sense of identification with sears at all” kirn said miami herald staff contributed to this report information from the chicago tribune was also used the location of the sears store on biscayne boulevard and northeast th street was significant in developing a retail district north of downtown miami built on nov   the store was one of the area’s first art deco buildings predating the art deco hotels on ocean drive by almost six years it was designed by nimmons carr and wright of chicago now only its tower

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
