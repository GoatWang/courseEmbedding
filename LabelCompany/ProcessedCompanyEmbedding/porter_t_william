editionverified purchasehaving recently seen for the third or fourth time the movie delovely with kevin kline as cole porter i realized that i was fascinated by this very talented man i had also seen the hollywoodized rendition of coles life and times with cary grant and comparing the two movies and trying to figure out the truth was a mystery for me hence when i saw this book was available i immediately ordered it it is a provocative entertaining and highly informative biography of this talented mans life and i thoroughly enjoyed it my husband tells me that i am addicted to his music and i know the words to most every song of his it doesnt hurt that i also have an abiding interest in the broadway music world as an aside i would love to see his former apartment at the waldorf as my
