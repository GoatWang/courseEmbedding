learn faster see your products big picture and streamline experimentation with user story mapping by brian anderson  branderlog  june   download a free copy of building an optimized business a curated collection of chapters from the o’reilly web operations and performance library this post is an excerpt by jeff patton from user story mapping one of the selections included in the curated collection this is my friend eric standing in front of his backlog and task board in his team room he’s a product owner working hard with his team to build a successful product but right now it’s not that doesn’t worry eric though he has a strategy for making his product successful and so far it’s working eric works for a company called liquidnet liquidnet is a global trading network for institutional investors long before eric came to stand in front of the board in the picture someone at his company identified a group of customers liquidnet could serve better along with a few ideas of how to do that eric is part of a team that took those ideas and ran with them that’s what product owners do if you thought they were always acting on their own great ideas well you’re wrong one of the hard parts of being a product owner is taking ownership of someone else’s idea and helping to make it successful or proving that it isn’t likely to be the best product owners like eric help their entire team take ownership of the product read more… comment applied devops and the potential of docker the cultural impact within a software engineering organization can be dramatic by brian anderson  branderlog  may   early release available editor’s note this post is from karl matthias and sean p kane authors of “docker up  running” a guide to quickly learn how to use docker to create packaged images for easy management testing and deployment of software at the python developers conference in santa clara california on march th  with no preannouncement and little fanfare solomon hykes the founder and ceo of dotcloud gave a minute lightning talk where he first introduced the world to a brand new tool for linux called docker it was a response to the hardships of shipping software at scale in a fastpaced world and takes an approach that makes it easy to map organizational processes to the principles of devops the capabilities of the typical software engineering company have often not kept pace with the quickly evolving expectations of the average technology user users today expect fast reliable systems with continuous improvements ease of use and broad integrations many in the industry see the principles of devops as a giant leap toward building organizations that meet the challenges of delivering high quality software in today’s market docker is aimed at these challenges

downloadbuilding an optimized business download a free copy of building an optimized business a curated collection of chapters from the o’reilly web operations and performance library this post is an excerpt by jez humble joanne molesky and barry o’reilly from lean enterprise one of the selections included in the curated collection in most enterprises there is a distinction between the people who build and run software systems often referred to as “it” and those who decide what the software should do and make the investment decisions often called “the business” these names are relics of a bygone age in which it was considered a cost necessary to improve efficiencies of the business not a creator of value for external customers by building products and services these names and the functional separation have stuck in many organizations as has the relationship between them and the mindset that often goes with the relationship ultimately we aim to remove this distinction in highperformance organizations today people who design build and run softwarebased products are an integral part of business they are given — and accept — responsibility for customer outcomes but getting to this state is hard and it’s all too easy to slip back into the old ways of doing things read more… comment from industrialism to postindustrialism leveraging the power of emergence to balance flexibility with coherency by brian anderson  branderlog  april   download building an optimized business download a free copy of building an optimized business a curated collection of chapters from the o’reilly web operations and performance library this post is an excerpt by jeff sussna from designing delivery one of the selections included in the curated collection in  daniel bell published a book called “the coming of postindustrial society” in it he posited a seismic shift away from industrialism towards a new socioeconomic structure which he named ‘postindustrialism’ bell identified four key transformations that he believed would characterize the emergence of postindustrial society service would replace products as the primary driver of economic activity work would rely on knowledge and creativity rather than bureaucracy or manual labor corporations which had previously strived for stability and continuity would discover change and innovation as their underlying purpose these three transformations would all depend on the pervasive infusion of computerization into business and daily life if bell’s description of the transition from industrialism to postindustrialism sounds eerily familiar it should we are just now living through its fruition every day we hear proclamations touting the arrival of the service economy service sector employment has outstripped product sector employment throughout the developed world  companies are recognizing the importance of the customer experience drinking coffee has become as much about the bar and the barista as about the coffee itself owning a car has become as much about having it serviced as about driving it new disciplines such as service design are emerging that use design techniques to improve customer satisfaction throughout the service experience read more… comment the puppet design philosophy explore the declarative idempotent and stateless puppet dsl by brian anderson  branderlog  april   buy puppet best practicesit can be very easy to get started with puppet but scaling it effectively can be a challenge in this early release excerpt from puppet best practices author chris barbour discusses the philosophy behind using puppet effectively before we begin to explore practical best practices with puppet it’s valuable to understand the reasoning behind these recommendations puppet can be somewhat alien to technologists who have a background in automation scripting where most of our scripts are procedural puppet is declarative while a declarative language has many major advantages for configuration management it does impose some interesting restrictions on the approaches we use to solve common problems although puppet’s design philosophy may not be the most exciting topic to begin this book it drives many of the practices in the coming chapters understanding that philosophy will help contextualize many of the recommendations covered read more…
