percent of mgmspringfield the downtown casino planned by the las vegasbased company a resident of hampden he is the only other owner of the planned casino project besides mgm and stands to be a big local financial winner if the casino is built paul c picknelly smiles during a victory rally in springfield on july  to celebrate voter approval of mgm springfieldmichael s gordonthe republican file  the estimated  million casino planned for  to  acres in the south end of springfield across from the massmutual center is poised to receive a major boost on monday the fivemember massachusetts gaming commission is scheduled to release a decision on whether mgm is suitable to apply for a casino license in springfield if commission members follow the recommendation of their investigators mgm would be cleared to seek the license with certain conditions picknelly declined to provide an interview for this story and has not commented on the casino when reached by the republican in the past stephen p crosby chairman of the gaming commission said he did not recall any suitability issues raised about paul picknelly during the commissions dec  hearing on mgm it would make sense that you would have partial local ownership crosby said i think it is probably good in principle one of the whole ideas was economic development in massachusetts and to create wealth in massachusetts picknelly was a partner in a company blue tarp redevelopment that signed a letter of intent with mgm in march of last year according to a redacted commission background report on mgms bid the casino plan was kept under wraps until a formal announcement in august of last year its unclear how much money paul picknelly would make but he would receive a perpetual annual share of revenues from the casino as well as payments if the project hits several milestones according to the background report paul picknellys brother peter a picknelly ceo and chairman of peter pan bus lines and a former rival of his brother for a casino in springfield said the mgm casino is a huge opportunity for springfield im happy for him peter picknelly said of his brother im pleased for him peter picknelly was a partner with penn national gaming which planned a casino in the north end of downtown springfield including on properties owned by the republican he said he is now working on a transportation plan with mgm and some real estate opportunities with the casino company in a city competition springfield mayor domenic j sarno choose mgm over penn national in april fiftyeight percent of city voters approved the mgm casino in a ballot question on july  they came up with a better plan but there is certainly no hard feelings said peter picknelly he said he and his brother had a business disagreement about the best location for a casino in springfield a project long supported by their late father peter l picknelly who died in  he said he talks with his brother weekly and emails daily each brother has a minority interest in businesses led by the other he said in the background report on mgms ethics and finances investigators said they found no derogatory information about paul picknelly that could affect his suitability for licensure with the commission the report said picknellys finances are complex investigators said they needed numerous discussions with picknelly and his team to develop a complete picture about his deal with mgm in the fall of  paul picknelly and partners sought to put together parcels of real estate for a casino in springfield according to the background report picknelly told investigators that he helped retain a gaming consultant which marketed springfield to mgm after it initially chose a site in brimfield in march of last year mgm said it intended to purchase most of blue tarp the company agreed to pay picknelly and three other members a perpetual annual payment from revenues from the springfield casino the report said mgm would also provide payments for milestones including upon acquiring certain parcels when the casino is licensed and when it opens to the public the report said the other members of blue tarp  lawyer thomas d murphy jr francis j cataldo jr a real estate investor and springfield businessman heriberto flores  no longer have ownership interests in blue tarp flores resigned with no apparent compensation from blue tarp and joined the penn national bid according to the report murphy and cataldo sold their interests to picknelly several months after mgm bought blue tarp picknelly assumed the risks if mgms bid fails and became the sole remaining member to partner with mgm the report said through his real estate companies cataldo also has negotiated options to sell at least a half dozen properties to mgm if the project moves forward the report said paul picknelly who was born and raised in springfield with his brother and their sister mary jean attended holyoke community college but he did not receive a degree at  he was working in the family business and rose to senior vice president and chief operating officer at peter pan bus lines in  mgm said in a filing with the city he owns at least  percent of  businesses including peter pan bus lines the commissions report said picknelly owns and operates the room sheraton hotel and the hilton garden inn both in springfield according to a report filed by mgm with the city he is also owner and operator of monarch place a story downtown office building that includes the sheraton and is the largest commercial real estate project in the state outside boston according to the mgm filing bruce stebbins a member of the gaming commission and former springfield city councilor and business development administrator for the city said he knows picknelly from when he was on the council and a city administrator in order to dispel a possible conflict stebbins said he disclosed his interactions with both picknelly brothers to gov deval patrick attorney general martha coakley and treasurer steve grossman who jointly appointed stebbins to the commission stebbins said he participated in the suitability decision on mgm when he was development administrator stebbins said for example that paul picknelly showed him some improvements he planned to the sheraton he was not seeking city funds stebbins said in a prepared statement paul picknelly said in part that he spoke with a lot of casino operators but mgm offered the best vision for revitalizing downtown springfield i felt like my job as a native son of springfield was to find a partner who shared my vision and the vision of many of my friends and colleagues he stated once i met mgms team early last year i was confident they could take it from there carole brennan spokeswoman for mgm springfield also released a statement saying in part from day one of meeting paul mgms leadership team was in sync with him on an mgm springfield vision that both helped rebuild the tornadodevastated section of downtown springfield and offered the best economic development plan for the entire city the casino is planned to have up to  slot machines and a room hotel the project is expected to create  construction jobs and  permanent jobs kevin e kennedy chief development officer for springfield said its great that the planned casino will have a small percent of local ownership hes a very good
