find global websites and locations region africa asia pacific europe latin america middle east north america country home investor relations corporate governance leadership andrew n liveris liveris why  how to participate in china’s transformation columbia business school china business conference columbia university new york april   remarks as prepared for delivery thank you professor barry salzberg for that introduction and thank you all for welcoming me to this beautiful campus it is a privilege to be with so many future business leaders – including kevin wu and the columbia business school greater china society who invited me here today i am honored to join you in discussing the next wave of surprises that china has in store and i am especially glad to be with you at such a pivotal moment in world history because i believe that far more than any political agreement or economic treaty you – and your peers at similar schools in china – are the key to our political and economic future your generation of leaders will decide whether china’s rise will lead to conflict as some – like henry kissinger – conjecture may be inevitable as an emergent power supplants an established power or whether a powerful united states and a prosperous china can grow succeed and thrive together… peacefully sharing the world stage avoiding the rhythms of history experts like henry kissinger have argued for decades that competition is “embedded in human nature” as students of competition in a sense i cannot imagine that you disagree but – with due respect to the experts – what shape that competition might take… and whether this crucial relationship between the world’s chief economic powers will be defined by dialogue or by discord… is very much up to you china risen and rising still as you may know i am australian by birth greek by heritage and i now live here in the united states but of all the places where i have lived and worked over the course of my career none has commanded more of my attention or fascination than china i first traveled there  years ago – for one of my first jobs at the dow chemical company since then i have been back multiple times each year i was in beijing just last week where i had the opportunity to speak with a group very much like this one at tsinghua university i am not exaggerating when i say that china surprises me every time i return i was lucky to have a frontrow seat thirty years ago when deng xiaoping opened china to the world and in the decades since i have had the privilege of watching – and even better participating – as china’s rise has transformed not only china but the rest of the global economy these days it seems china is at the center of every global conversation – from this forum… to last year’s un conference on climate change… to the g which will convene in hangzhou this september we are all chinawatchers and many of us are china students and this has made many people quite sensitive to every fluctuation in china’s economic and policy environments whether the latest news out of beijing or the latest numbers out of shanghai and shenzhen dual horizons many have been alarmed by the stock market turmoil we have seen in recent months some economists predict that china’s economy is in for a “hard landing” they suggest a “severe adjustment period” is just around the corner we cannot be blithe about this volatility but the fact is that china’s economy is in the midst of a onceinageneration transition president xi jinping’s pivot away from the hazards of commodity exports… and toward the economic strength and stability that flow from higher levels of domestic consumption and tradable value this transformation began in  it will continue for another five years – at least but i believe it will prove even more critical than the deng xiaoping opening of thirty years ago positioning the world’s secondlargest economy for more sustainable growth and success that is why despite the growing pains we will see in the short term i disagree with the conventional wisdom i am not merely optimistic about china’s economy i am confident in china i am bullish about china i am not suggesting that growth and prosperity will be automatic that you can just throw a dart and hit a bullseye so to speak as you might have been able to do in china a decade ago on the contrary we have real volatility to contend with we will have to brave global headwinds and slowing growth… navigating shortterm challenges in order to take advantage of longterm opportunities we will need to act like pilots do – keeping one eye on the instruments in front of us and the other on the distant horizon i call this a “dual horizons” mindset and it is the only way to weather this turbulence and keep moving toward our destination positioning ourselves for success in china – today tomorrow and ten years from now – will not be easy but it is a matter of choice we can choose to participate we can choose to be partners in this new phase of the chinese economy if we do i am confident this choice will be rewarded twin transformations with the th five year plan that president xi unveiled last week china’s government is accelerating its pivot to the domestic sector… transitioning from being an exporter of basic materials to a creator and consumer of hightech goods and products at dow we have chosen to be part of this transformation to help teach china how to build the demand side even though we have been in the country for decades we have not made the mistake of thinking we are owed anything because dow does not want to be merely present for china’s transformation – or saudi arabia’s… or india’s… or europe’s and america’s for that matter we want to power these transformations we want to help drive them this is why ten years ago we began a historic transformation of our own ten years ago dow’s success depended on the commodities cycle we rode it up and down like a roller coaster but we had come to recognize that the path we were on was unsustainable we saw that at a time of increasing volatility in a world where change moves at the “speed of live” many industrial conglomerates were too big complex and unwieldy to survive so we chose a different path we transformed into an engine of innovation – a close partner to customers in solving their challenges we adopted a philosophy i like to call “smart scale” maintaining our industry leadership while honing our organizational agility as a result our success is no longer driven by the cycle it is driven by innovation and integration and today’s dow provides not just products but solutions to our customers because today’s dow is nimble enough to go where the growth is serve the right markets we transformed in part in order to serve the right markets in china today that means helping the middle class grow by  china’s middle class will grow to  million – twice the present us population this will create enormous demand for the highvalue solutions our transformation has left us uniquely positioned to provide but again this did not happen by accident we chose this path it has taken years to prepare ourselves for this opportunity over a decade dow has positioned our product mix in china to be technologydriven waiting for the country to shift its economy toward one that values high quality products… not just a large quantity of products rather than selling commodities and reprocessing them for export – the china engine of yesteryear – we worked to fulfill essential needs… to build goods no one else can build… and to serve china’s consumer engine of today and tomorrow in  we launched a worldclass business and innovation center in shanghai our largest outside of the us including stateoftheart rd facilities where more than  scientists and engineers work in  different labs we have opened one new business center in china each year since  and we broke ground just two weeks ago on a brandnew dow agricultural sciences plant in northeastern china that will manufacture industryleading products for china and for the world our transformation is allowing us to drive and capture value in new places… and even to achieve  percent year over year volume growth in  in spite of the broader slowdown we have seen collaborate locally innovate globally this is possible only because of dow’s deep roots in east asia it is because our transformation has been fueled by local collaboration… in pursuit of lifechanging innovation i often say that dow is a company of communities we are where we operate and this means we increasingly are china our employees and leadership teams do not just work in the markets they serve they are of these markets and they can forge the strategic relationships that companies like dow need close collaborative connections with ngos and governments a perfect example of strategic collaboration in action is the uschina building energy efficiency fund – an ambitious new partnership in which dow plays a pivotal role today buildings are the source of roughly  percent of all greenhouse gas emissions our energy efficiency fund will address this by reducing the costs of sustainable american technologies… while accelerating their development in china the fund will also serve a broader global good – helping to usher in a brighter future for people around the world this too is at the heart of china’s transformation and at the center of the th five year plan an ambitious strategy that will bring the government’s focus on environmental and social wellbeing to the fore the five year plan will achieve this by prioritizing emissions reduction… addressing the root causes of air pollution… and rallying stakeholders throughout the country to enhance sustainability both from the “bottomup” and from the “topdown” the plan will also strengthen the government’s enforcement of environmental regulations it will bolster china’s environmental justice system it will encourage investment in sustainable technologies and incentivize “green” business practices most importantly it will mobilize both the chinese public and partners in private enterprise to meet the considerable challenges ahead sustainability after all this work cannot be completed by government alone overcoming today’s sustainability challenges will require solutions that can only be delivered by government business and civil society in close collaboration consider that air pollution contributes to the deaths of a staggering  million chinese citizens each year that is  lives every day and the problem is only getting worse consider that by   billion people – in china and around the world – will live in regions where clean water is scarce consider that by  – as the global population tops nine billion – worldwide demand for food will increase by  percent and all of humanity will be counting on sustainable solutions to address these urgent needs fortunately sustainability is also a pillar of dow’s transformation we share with china a steadfast belief that doing well by doing good is not only possible but essential – even in today’s volatile environment with our  sustainability goals dow is integrating the value of nature into everything we do and our scientists in shanghai are leading the way when it comes to inventing and manufacturing sustainable solutions – solutions that directly address priorities laid out in the new five year plan to keep the air clear our scientists have pioneered a firstofitskind formaldehyde abatement technology that gives paint incredible aircleaning functionality converting formaldehyde in the air into harmless water vapor to address the water challenge dow has worked with the haier group to commercialize the world’s first ecofriendly washing machine which reduces water consumption more than  percent… while removing as much as  percent of bacteria during washing and to provide better food safety and extended shelf life we have developed technologies like packxperttm which has won the china sustainable package technology award and the “rd ” award for its reduction in raw materials use – and its ability to protect more product in a lighter package conclusion of course innovation does not happen in a vacuum our ability to continue developing differentiated sustainable solutions will depend on the government’s willingness to create an atmosphere conducive to innovation… friendly to entrepreneurial spirit… and founded on mutual trust i have conveyed directly to president xi that he can count on dow’s partnership as china embraces regulatory reform… and develops clear rational rules of the road because dow like china is focused on the future we can build together the theme of this conference “unveiling china’s next wave of surprises” stimulated me to think about china’s last wave of surprises from the great opening of deng xiaoping’s china circa  how toward the end of these  years china had become an export engine par excellence… but had left many of its citizens behind i remembered a session with premier wen jiabao where he teared up when he spoke about the great achievement of bringing  million people out of poverty… but how many had been left behind how the issues of corruption income inequality and real estate bubbles were endemic to the new china – and the new china was not inclusive president xi jinping is sweeping in an era of fundamental new reforms to solve these issues and many more so i thought as an avid chinawatcher and sinophile that i could conclude my remarks to you today by having a list of china’s next wave of surprises over the next decade here you go some are already obvious china will move to a phase of soe’s… with a little “e” china’s entrepreneurial ecosystem will be unique to china china’s consumers will outspend their us counterparts on a runrate basis by  china will keep a large agrarian economy but will be a fast adopter of new technologies “made in china” will be matched by “invented in china” and ip enforcement will become stronger and stronger china’s geopolitics will be led by their geoeconomics – which will define their relationships with other countries and last but not least china’s environmental stewardship will become exponentially better and will be an exemplar in enforceable regulatory standards we will all be able to breathe in beijing again my final thought for you do not let the  percent gdp growth number fool you at a  trillion gdp every year china adds a g economy go east there is opportunity and unique experience in every sector and on every street corner thank you leadership  dow the human element at work find global websites and locations region africa asia pacific europe

dow chemical company x times times times times cnbc news releases cnbc transcript andrew n liveris ceo dow chemical company monday  mar    am etcnbccom shares following is the transcript of a cnbc interview with andrew n liveris ceo dow chemical company the interview was broadcast on cnbc on  march  all references must be sourced to a cnbc interview interviewed by geoff cutmore anchor cnbc at china development forum  geoff cutmore so lets start andrew by just asking you how good or otherwise you feel about the growth momentum that the chinese economy has right now andrew n liveris look the growth momentum in china is based on their pivot of a few years ago almost as president xi came into power that discusses domestic sector growth economy rather than an export reliant economy id say a few years in its going as well as they wanted and for dow surpassing our expectations because the other pivot thats occurred here is the obvious one of the environment i mean when they hit the food safety issues a few years ago when they hit the you know the issues of water and clean water in their riverways if you look at the air and the air pollution especially in places in the urban centres like beijing theyve accelerated their notion in the th five year plan speaks to it of putting in place sustainable growth so sustainable growth if you put the technologies and the products these are domestic sector purchases these are companies being born all over china smes to reform stateowns that are needing these technologies and that will create new types of growth they call it high quality growth so instead of high volume only high quantity thats high quality gc the government has been trying to restructure and reform part of that has been down to the environmental story but some of it has also been about access capacity around the state owned enterprises theyve also been slowly opening the door in some sectors of the economy where there has been limited access are you concerned at all that under the pressure they feel now from the american administration some of those progressive moves get rolled back or suspended al so thats thats a very big question has several big bite sized chunks lets go one by one and ill give you the dow view the reforms as it relates to excess capacity in lets call it me two product lines that the state owned enterprises have been primarily involved in they used to call those pillar industries in essence those cutbacks those factory shut downs mostly for environmental reasons but really because of structural capacity reasons  oversupply theyre not low on the cost curve here theyre higher on the cost curve very few of those commodities do they have some sort of competitive edge those are being welcomed those are being in fact dow never participated in building petrochemicals here weve built in places like saudi arabia or the united states that are much lower on the cost curve and so the pivot from restructuring the structure of the supply side to working the demand side and then really look at the demand side as i said earlier as a domestic sector quality demand side to change the skills they need for the digital age to put in place efficient transportation smart cities and better food supply all those technologies are innovation driven so low cost integration commodity as a base fine theyve got enough building on top of that an innovation centric economy through investment here in china like dow has done we have a very large rd center our second largest in the world is right here in china we have got  chinese scientists working towards all these environmental drivers but also domestic drivers working with haier to give them a more efficient washing machine so it uses less water and takes out bacteria working with nippon paints and take out pollutants in indoor air quality and many other building projects and materials projects that i can quote those sorts of growth drivers are right in the sweet spot of technology driven companies now as it relates to the us administration and the back and forth thats begun and i want to emphasize the word begun its begun because what the inequity perceived in global distribution of wealth is not just unique to emerging countries its very much in the centrepiece of developing countries and the united states you know what president trump got elected on was very simple and that is the income distribution of the us economy as it became more and more of a service sector economy the factory workers the displaced workers of america didnt have a job to look forward to and the conundrum there is theres a half a million science based jobs open in the united states as we speak so what the issue is isnt really chinacentric the issue really is uscentric how do i rekindle manufacturing the united states not by taking it away from someway but rekindling it in the united states now will that manifest itself into a discussion on trade absolutely whats fair trade look like you said it in your question access are all us companies being able to access the chinese market equitably according to whether they are important whether they are local no so what does fair trade look like and is it in fact what we used to have in trade agreements thats a discussion thats opening up i call that healthy i as a global company want to access the chinese market the us market the south american market every market on the same standard gc so you dont think you get that access in china al well so over all the years that weve been operating here we could never do a petrochemical complex without making it a joint venture technology transfer had to occur in chinas first manifestation of economic growth now that theyve got their own technology they need it less service sector countries companies cant access this market the financial services insurance companies health sector sector companies so those you know access issues on investment not necessarily on trade of goods are importing china has been pretty good under wto standards we can import pretty much everything here as a manufacturer from elsewhere but to invest here  we didnt have equal access gc but do you not feel conflicted that you are now perceived to be part of donald trumps drive for america first when your business makes two thirds of its revenue from the rest of the world al the question is flawed because i am not part of anyones drive to make america first im part of president trumps activity to rekindle manufacturing so its not a zero sum game and that is fundamental is the answer to your question this is not a zero sum game we all know that people who trade in the global system we know what has to happen here and to satisfy a populations feeling of inequity globalization hasnt been fair think about it this way america pretty much since world war  has been a consumption economy in essence you can import pretty much anything to america and sell it in america in any environment retail or in the channel you want to invest in america there hasnt been any incentive to invest other than the market so whether youre an importer or an investor if youre a consumption economy the american economy is the best in access every other economy is an investment economy even europe has protections around investment so i would say to you there is a recalibration going on globalization think of it as not consumption but investment i want to be part of that conversation so i get a better answer for the dow chemical company gc you have a very nuanced view on this strategy the problem is that people read the headlines and they see the fact that steve mnuchin was unprepared to put an anti protectionist language in the g communique that sends a terrible message doesnt it to anybody that believes that free trade lifts income levels for everybody al so people elect governments governments do what they have to do to protect their people we should not judge why the democratic process elects this or that dow is  years young we work with every government and ive been ceo for a dozen years i work with every government in the united states every government around the world including this one here so i am not afraid of headlines its the body of work that goes below the headlines thats more important behind every statement theres a body of work that has to happen and i would say very important to the us government is job creation in the manufacturing base of america and if you look at the raw data america has lost that battle the last three decades it wants to regain footing now there are some advantages  entrepreneurial best universities in the world energy low cost energy the petrochemical chemical sector that i belong to investing  billion dollars as we speak dow  billion dollars so we are not starting from zero so what businesses like ours have to do is help with the body of work together to get america what it needs investment and growth and job creation for the new age not yesterdays era the new era and then grow from there off of a flat level playing field im all for that in any country gc but i mean not to get too theoretical about this but ricardian comparative advantage is all about trade happening to the advantage of both parties and if you can manufacture at a lower cost somewhere else trying to bring those jobs back to america is trying to reverse the rules of economics isnt it al yeah and were not going to spend an awful lot of time at this point because its a one or two hour interview probably but please remember whats happened to the world based on technology the industrial age  the fourth industrial revolution is creating this another another pressure its enormous on job creation its in essence the digitization of industries not just digitization of communication or even digitization of ecommerce which everyone in the in the world probably understands somewhat if youre an online shopper or for sure use a smartphone but the digitization of manufacturing has begun and companies like dow are digitizing that means were not creating the same sort of jobs we used to create so the war on human capital and the war on job creation has moved and the governments that get that when they rebuild their manufacturing sectors to this new economy have to look at skills look at their education system and they have to look at many things that other countries might do and build them all together like germany and apprenticeship programs many of us have become universities in our own right because the universities are not giving us what we need so when you look at competitive advantage think of it in the context of the technology age and what we havent done to prepare our kids and frankly the displaced workers out there mostly in western economies we cant protect them we have to skill them we have to help them get these new skills to deal with robotics and automation and the internet of things and the digitization of every factory floor and in by so doing we create an ecosystem of new jobs and i mentioned earlier half a million of these jobs are opened in the united states as we speak me yeah were not going to get there overnight but we can make that happen faster if we cooperate with governments and get them into the right programs gc but lets just bring this back to a human level look we understand the points that youre making and im sure as youve explained them to people that youve spoken to here as youve gone into some of the details perhaps their eyes widened and theyve gone now i start to see some of the reasons why youre involved but you must also be getting some pressure here i would imagine a little bit of blowback particularly from the chinese who see you now as being a party to an administration thats had relatively harsh language towards this government al look ive been coming to china since the s one thing i know about the chinese culture in the chinese people and chinese leadership they never overreact they are patient and they seek to understand the meetings ive had frankly have been nothing like you describe theyve been more well now that youre inside discussing this and understanding it the way youre understanding it tell me a lot more about it and how does it apply to the relationship and im getting that sort of question and you know i wont push back on the label youre giving me remember im a global ceo you said those statements earlier gc and youre in a unique position of having helped both administrations you were also involved with president obamas administration as you compare the approaches of the two how do you feel what trump is doing is more effective in terms of rolling back some of the red tape and the barriers to you doing business al yeah the distinction is interesting because the three pillars of activity are almost the same the work products on what are the technologies of the future what are the policies to encourage them how do we get the workforce skilled the emphasis in this administration is the last two the workforce skilling and training and finding national programs that make sense as recent as yesterday two days ago in the united states we had a meeting on that when the german chancellor visited how did we learn from germany and then most importantly the point you made how do we take out these headwinds to enable manufacturing to invest in this country in the us again just to give you one step the average regulatory cost to a us manufacturer is a small medium and large is roughly  per employee per year the average cost to all other sectors is less than half of that at  so the manufacturing sector has his added burden at double the rate of every other sector so just working on that alone forget everything else that gets done would immediately enable the policy environment to have an effect on investment there are many other things i could talk about but those two areas regulatory and training those two areas our emphasis points on this administration gc on the regulatory and i am going to wrap it up here because i know you need to go off let me just ask you then about the process here to finally get this deal over the line with dupont because its felt torturous i think to me looking from the outside so it must have felt even tougher for you on the inside here youre talking now about a second quarter closure of this how frustrating though has this regulatory process been al so antitrust regulatory regulators around the world whether they be the eu or china or in the us any time too big businesses get together you know we were expecting that there would be some of this its taken much longer in europe than we imagine because there was a very decent thesis put out by the regulator that we had to respond to that it had never been raised before and also the context of the deal changed the other deals that happened pretty much right after us changed the context of our deal no matter which way you want to say it you couldnt just look at our deal and say well im looking at those other two coming along so that created a series of delays you mentioned a second quarter so first half is what we said im very confident were going to get there in fact first half is what were all planning on we have put in place now all the programs to get us ready for day one were gearing up down dupont are getting ready to create this new company that will then have three companies spun out of it the regulatory remedies for sure have been frustrating ive used a line which im going to use on you three months of delay in the context of  million of new value – fine gc but couldnt europe do with a little bit of trump va va voom when it comes to getting these things to run a bit faster al there are plenty of people commenting on what the eu is like and what there isnt and including from the us right now my experience with the eu is  nations trying to – the eu  – trying to make a decision on pretty much anything is dramatic but its own bureaucracy rate so yeah could it have been easier and simpler for sure but look i see a finish line so you know what whatever it took to get from there to that finish line  fine im a big boy we know how to get this done this deal is phenomenal when its day one i can look at it and say thats all memory faded memory more from cnbc news releases cnbc exclusive cnbc transcript united airlines president  ceo oscar munoz speaks with cnbcs squawk box today cnbc exclusive cnbc

us and beyond on the globe will be determined by how quickly the next president acts and lets call it put in place an fdr effect i mean get in place as fast as possible the transition teams work with the treasury secretary and the outgoing administration and really start to frame economic stimuli that will create a sense of confidence in the american economy going forward deficit and stimulus the deficits and how much we owe as hard as it is for me to say this almost have to be put to one side i think we need to put some real money into the economy not only the fiscal tools such as cutting interest rates but whether they be tax benefits and providing some checks to the american people some help on mortgages all the things that have to be done in ailing industries for sure the auto industry needs help all these things are going to cost money and they are going to cost money in the very short term you know i just came back in from china and they are putting money into their economy through infrastructure spending and spending on alternative energy these sorts of programs both candidates have spoken about are putting money directly back into the economy now not waiting a year from now but now and i think those sorts of interventions will not only impart new lifeblood into the economy but frankly create a sense of confidence that its ok to borrow again its ok to spend again now as you look at more medium and longterm policies youve got to get the words efficient borrowing and efficient spending in there but for now we have to correct the downward slope that were on because were either going to make this a vshaped recession a ushaped recession or an lshaped recession an lshaped recession obviously i dont even need to speak about that a ushaped—if the bottom of that u is two years or more were going to get some real chronic hurt out there in terms of people who lose jobs the american economys competitiveness and frankly the globe as a whole will suffer the next administration both campaigns leading into the election and beyond the election realize that the american economy needs to put in place some medium and longterm fixes such as the ones i raised i think its the responsibility of ceos the responsibility of many industry sectors such as the ones ive been talking about to step up and be part of that solution space to help our politicians—administration congress—not approach things in a partisan way but a bipartisan way for america really make them live up to their promise for why they got elected in the first place which is to find solutions that matter for america i believe we cant stay silent and stay on the sidelines and just beat the drum and say this is what you should do we should come forward really stick our necks out and say this is what should happen and in some of the cases frankly well have to give a little to get the right answers an address to climate change is a great example every sector will have to give a little for the greater good including my sector and i think for the greater good needs to be the headline that we all operate under for the next couple of years to address this complex agenda that i just laid out energy ive been an active proponent of two policies that if they are not put into place then the american economys competitiveness will continue to be hollowed out one i believe is getting full address and thats energy policy both candidates have now stepped forward and have articulated what their vision for energy policy is we in the chemical industry and we at dow chemical are strong supporters of alternatives and so whether it be green chemistry biochemistry or biofuels wind solar all those tools that we have at our disposal are very necessary however a full energy policy needs to include all components weve articulated the efficiency side of the equation the increased production of fossil fuels clean fossil fuels a component thats nuclear and on top of that all of the alternatives and so that i believe is job one two and three without an energy policy our industry will continue to build factories and invest in jobs overseas other countries are putting in place very very sound energy policies that include all of those components industrial policy the second thing that weve been pushing for dow in particular is a readdress to industrial policy you know america has become uncompetitive in industry industry is only  of this economy although that  is over  trillion and employs literally  million americans in manufacturing but we dont have sound tax policy we have a very broken tort system we have a poor health benefit pension system we have of course the regulatory issues very bad regulations that over the years have become worse and of course this whole thing on energy those five things when you put them together make american industry uncompetitive compared with the oecd countries like germany and japan—forget labor costs so i believe an approach to the industrial sector needs to occur in this country industry generates rd seventy percent of nongovernment rd comes from industry education the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up industry employs young graduates from our industry and into highpaying jobs and as you know a lack of an address into chemistry engineering and science is hollowing that out as we speak to places like china and india and elsewhere and we at dow are noticing it we are finding more talent overseas than in the us which is a travesty to the american university system which is still the best in the world so you put all those things together—thats a lot of fix that needs to occur i believe working closely with industry our industry other industries the next administration needs to put these policies into place return to the obama election  table of contents before its here its on the bloomberg terminal learn more most read americans

liveris appointed ceo in  after the board of directors unanimously selected him in part based upon his plan to transform dow began to implement the new strategy his plan called for dow to reinforce its core strengths in providing its clients with customised chemicals plastics and advanced materials including electronics and agricultural products such as genetically improved seeds the plan also called for reducing dows exposure to commodity chemical and plastics which were subject to competition especially from new entrants from the middle east and asia who benefit from cost advantages part of the plan to derisk the business called for the formation of joint ventures to free up dow capital for deployment in more specialised areas of the business as cited above the formation of joint

confluence of factors including uncertainty in the credit markets unprecedented lower demand for chemical products the ongoing global recession and pending business issues in march  liveris and his management team organized a plan to implement the rohm and haas integration focusing on growth and cost synergies but also reducing costly debt from the transaction through public offerings along with

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
