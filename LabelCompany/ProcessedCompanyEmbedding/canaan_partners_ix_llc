visionaries with transformative ideas while we love speedy success we’re acutely aware that greatness comes in many forms and at different times that’s why we’re not afraid to break the mold to bring something spectacular to life our approach is personal we don’t believe in a onesizefitsall approach but there are a few absolutes intrinsic to who we are and how we work and these values weren’t contrived out of thin air they’re hard earned over the past  years and counting  high performance low ego the old adage “actions speak louder than words” rings true within canaan’s walls and in our interactions with companies out in the wild words like understated and effective are often used to describe our partners and that’s fine by us we’ll leave the bragging to the others “seasoned investors can be very arrogant but canaan is no bs unassuming and humble—no hysteria no angst”— michael gilman ceo arrakis  people are more than statistics a diverse team means we bring varied perspectives to the table and that table welcomes outofthebox thinking spirited debate and people from all walks of life it’s our individual backgrounds and interests that inform our collective approach which spans industries generations and coasts in short our diversity is who we are and what we do “theres a lot of talk about diversity on boards but it’s great to have a smart strong woman in a leadership position on mine”— michael laskoff ceo annum  we ask for help and so should you we firmly believe that two heads are better than one so while our investors thrive in  partnerships our companies also have the support of the entire canaan team whenever wherever recruiting your executive team we’ll mobilize our full network need operational advice to bring a product to market we’ll connect you with the right partner or colleague our resources are yours “even if canaan hadn’t funded us just going through the process with them – the discussions we had and the questions they asked – already made us a better company and that’s amazing”— julie wainwright ceo the real real  the golden rule still applies we treat you like we treat ourselves—with respect transparency and honesty—even if it’s sometimes not what you want to hear it’s this approach that makes our portfolio companies more like family because we’re not afraid to get in the weeds and help solve big hairy problems in fact it’s what we live for we’re acutely aware that our success hinges on your success so we do what it takes “we made big strategic shifts as a company and worked closely with maha through all of them canaan is really smart about the way they get involved and how they support you through good times and bad”— kevin chou former ceo kabam  meddling is for mothers not investors we’d be lying if we said we weren’t handson but we also know when to step back and let you soar our goal is to add value to your process and help you grow in ways you couldn’t alone that’s why you’ll never see us booking meetings just to check a box or “see how are things are going” we’ll already know because that’s the kind of relationship we have with our companies “rich is an amazing thought partner his real world operational expertise has been tremendously valuable as weve scaled having this type of access to the canaan team has been an incredible benefit to our team”— john kobs ceo apartment
