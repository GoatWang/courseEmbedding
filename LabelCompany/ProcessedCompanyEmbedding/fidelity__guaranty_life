to file a notification of the merger under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended due to an available exemption nongaap measures management believes that certain nongaap financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable gaap measures are included herein aoi is calculated by adjusting net income to eliminate i the impact of net investment gains including otherthantemporary impairment otti losses recognized in operations but excluding gains and losses on derivatives hedging our indexed annuity policies ii the effect of changes in the interest rates used to discount the fia embedded derivative liability and iii the effect of change in fair value of the reinsurance related embedded derivative all adjustments to aoi are net of the corresponding voba and dac impact the income tax impact related to these adjustments is measured using an effective tax rate of  as appropriate while these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of fgl market conditions impacting these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the business accordingly we believe using a measure which excludes their impact is effective in analyzing the trends of our operations our nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such nongaap measures in the same manner as we do net investment spread is the excess of net investment income earned over the sum of interest credited to policyholders and the cost of hedging our risk on fia policies average assets under management aaum is the sum of i total invested assets at amortized cost excluding derivatives ii related party loans and investments and iii cash and cash equivalents at the end of each month in the period divided by the number of months in the period book value per share excluding aoci is calculated as total stockholders equity excluding aoci divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding sales are not derived from any specific gaap income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with gaap for gaap purposes annuity sales are recorded as deposit liabilities ie contract holder funds management believes that presentation of sales as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business and helps depict longer term trends that may not be apparent in the results of operations due to the timing of sales and revenue recognition while management believes that nongaap measurements are useful

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

policyholder and contract obligations this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events aa very strong aa ifs ratings denote a very low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments they indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events a strong a ifs ratings denote
