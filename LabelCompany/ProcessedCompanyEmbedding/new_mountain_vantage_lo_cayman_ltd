representatives who act like owners focused on increasing shareholder value will advocate a fair and full process will advocate timely board action with clear deadlines and deliverables vantage believes shareholders need a seat at the table � i the appalachia opportunity � overview of appalachia opportunity appalachia is the oldest producing basin in the united states appalachia has several attractive characteristics longlived gas reserves proximity to markets nfg is one of the largest landowners in the basin controls  acres roughly the size of rhode island  in pennsylvania  in new york significant fee mineral ownership approximately  acres roughly  acres estimated by management to be undeveloped vantage believes that nfg has opportunities in at least two formations shallow sands nfg

before vantage became involved in nfg nfg had been underinvesting in appalachia historically in vantages view nfg underinvested in appalachia did not show a map of acreage to shareholders had not disclosed proved undeveloped probable and possible p reserves averaged only  wells per year    instead nfg had spent over  million dollars from  to  on what vantage views as an unsuccessful exploration program in canada and the gulf of mexico while spending only  million cumulatively in appalachia over the same fiveyear period vantage believes nfg has misallocated capital in its ep

mindset over the past several months natural gas prices have skyrocketed in any but the most shortsighted of views this is not good for national fuel   annual report letter to shareholders philip c ackerman chairman of the board president  ceo � vantage commissioned schlumberger to help set new strategic direction for nfgs appalachian acreage as explained above in early  when vantage began its nfg investment nfg had issued no public map of its appalachian acreage had no p reserves for appalachia and was drilling only  wells per year on average between  and  even as range resources atlas energy equitable resources and others were moving aggressively in the region vantage believed it was necessary to engage a highly reputable third party to analyze data to determine whether appalachia could be a much more valuable asset for shareholders if properly developed vantage commissioned schlumberger in march  to assess the full reserve potential of all nfgs acreage position in appalachia including the potential number of shallow well drilling locations an optimal longterm drilling plan and the potential cash flows and net present value of the asset vantage presented a summary of schlumbergers work to nfg in  and encouraged nfg to retain schlumberger directly in order to reproduce the same high level strategic analysis for all shareholders the company chose not to do so vantage believes that the actions and successes of other ep companies in the region lead to the same strategic direction as the schlumberger analysis even if the schlumberger work did not exist vantage believes that the vantage and schlumberger work is not inconsistent with nfgs internal data and the netherland sewell report rather vantage believes that schlumberger is addressing a different broader and more strategic set of questions ie what all  acres could be worth if developed and managed optimally � vantage work with schlumberger indicates major untapped opportunities work summary schlumberger reviewed publicly available production data for a large sample set approximately  wells located in all counties where nfg owns acreage the data are from many operators not just nfg schlumberger developed a modeled type curve or decline curve for the low risk shallow horizons upper devonian  clinton medina in nfgs counties schlumberger modeled the economics of a potential drilling plan based on these average type curves and based on capital and operating cost assumptions in accordance with nfgs estimates conclusions at a natural gas price of  per mcf and an oil price of  per barrel schlumbergers model drilling program yields ebitda of approximately  million in year five of the program and a net present value at a  discount rate of approximately  billion vantage views schlumbergers work as strategic and directional rather than as a precise point estimate of ultimate value the marcellus shale opportunity would be in addition to this shallow level opportunity

investor day presentation dated november   � netherland sewell report to nfg reviewed only small part of big picture vantage believes that the netherland sewell report to nfg did not address the key strategic question that vantage has asked regarding the full resource potential of nfgs acreage only evaluated  out of  acres appears to have only evaluated the lowest risk infill drilling potential probable and possible locations are based on only one stepout from a subset of nfg wells no third party offset wells were evaluated the netherland sewell report to nfg as published left open critical questions does not address whether well recoveries may be greater with superior operational capabilities does not benchmark nfgs cost structure does not include a drilling plan or development plan does not consider the marcellus shale or other high potential horizons however the netherland sewell report to nfg does indicate substantial potential according to the netherland sewell report proved undeveloped reserves per well average  mmcfe probable and possible reserves per well average  mmcfe and  mmcfe respectively these estimates imply significant upside potential from nfgs reported results of  mmcfe reserves per well for its shallow gas program in  at  wells per year and  mmcfe per well value creation would be substantial the company indicated it expects proved reserves to grow as drilling continues although netherland sewell has identified only approximately  locations that can be classified as having undeveloped reserves we believe that at current commodity price levels and well costs hundreds of wells will be drillable each year for the foreseeable future we fully expect that the stepout locations we drill each year as well as the exploratory wells we will drill on the acreage that is now classified as only having prospective resources will yield additional locations that will ultimately be classifiable in the proved probable and possible categories  matt cabell
