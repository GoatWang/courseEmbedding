by sept  a year before his fouryear term expires general fogleman a member of the joint chiefs of staff since  would become the first air force chief of staff to leave voluntarily before his tenure was upgeneral fogleman  a highly decorated vietnamera fighter pilot has told associates in recent weeks that he would leave if defense secretary william s cohen punished air force commanders for failing to prevent the bombing at the khobar towers housing complex in dhahranin a statement issued today general fogleman said his decision was intended to defuse the perceived confrontation between myself and secretary cohen the general added my values and sense of loyalty to the troops led me to the conclusion that i may be out of step advertisement continue reading the main story general foglemans early departure is the latest blow to the air force the service is still reeling from criticism of its handling of the case of first lieut kelly flinn the b bomber pilot accused of adultery

advertisement continue reading the main story secretary cohen is expected to announce this week whether he will discipline anyone for the saudi disaster a pentagon inquiry last year singled out an air force commander brig gen terryl j schwalier for failing to safeguard the complex adequately but two air force reports concluded that the bombing was not the fault of general schwalierthe air force has delayed promoting general schwalier to two stars from one star pending mr cohens decision some lawmakers are urging the defense secretary to cancel general schwaliers promotion which would have the effect of ending his careersomeone should be held accountable shouldnt they senator richard c shelby an alabama republican who heads the intelligence committee said in a recent interviewsecretary cohen aware of the reports of general foglemans possible retirement had already started interviewing candidates before todays announcement aides said and will nominate a replacement sooni respect general foglemans personal decision to retire to pursue new opportunities after his service to the air force and to the nation mr cohen said in a terse statement issued at the pentagongeneral fogleman angered some senior lawmakers and pentagon officials with his rigid stance on lieutenant flinns case in testimony before the senate appropriations committee in may general fogleman said that by focusing on the adultery charge lawmakers were losing sight of a more important issuethis is an issue about an officer entrusted to fly nuclear weapons who disobeyed an order who lied general fogleman said thats what this is about advertisement continue reading the main story general foglemans blunt comments won cheers from many rankandfile air force personnel but drew rebukes from senators and

graduated from the air force academy the last straw was the khobar towers casethe question of responsibility for the bombing on june   has caused deep strains in the armed forces with generals and their civilian bosses debating whether congress and the public hold the most prudent field commanders to unrealistically high standardsin  general fogleman won a reputation for holding air force personnel to higher standards after he grounded five officers and imposed administrative penalties on several others for their role in the downing of two army helicopters over iraq twentysix people were killed when two air force fs mistakenly shot down the helicopters one captain went to trial for his role in the accident but he was acquittedgeneral fogleman and other senior air force officials closed ranks in support of general schwalier criticizing the original pentagon inquiry headed by a retired fourstar army general wayne a downinggeneral downing concluded that general schwalier had focused too much on preventing a car bomb from penetrating the housing complex and not enough on the possibility that a terrorist would detonate a huge bomb just outside the perimeter fencebut two air force reports cited scores of preventive measures that general schwalier took and concluded that the bomb was too large to defend againstthe air force challenged the technical accuracy of general downings estimate that the bomb was about  pounds using pentagon experts the air force determined the bomb was equal to  to  pounds of explosives advertisement continue reading the main story general

senator ted stevens an alaska republican who heads the senate appropriations committeesenator stevens who said he spoke to general fogleman about the issue last week said the general believes there are people who will be held accountable who had no ability to prevent the bombinggeneral foglemans frustration seeped down to lower levels in the past few months air force lawyers sympathetic to general schwalier prepared on their own initiative a memorandum suggesting that general downing had a financial conflict of interest with the inquirythey said the general received a  consulting fee from the science applications international corporation a research and consulting company based in san diego that makes antiterrorist devices that the inquiry recommended and therefore could profit from the conclusions in general downings report general downing is also on the companys board of directors the authors of the memorandum are not identified on the fourpage papergeneral downing in an interview today strongly denied the memorandums accusations and said the document attempted to create a smoke screen three senior pentagon officials including one familiar with an investigation into

‘mentors’ and contractor consultants share tweet pinit upinewscom by justin elliott published december    am views under a newly revealed arrangement that makes the famous “revolving door” seem quaint retired military officers are simultaneously drawing paychecks both from the government and from private sector businesses gunning for pentagon contracts according to a usa today investigationa defense consulting firm out in colorado called durango group which helps companies obtain dod contracts sits at the center of this lucrative arrangementabout a quarter or  of the retired officers who get a durango paycheck are also paid by taxpayers in the military’s “mentor” program at a rate of hundreds of dollars per hour according to usa today they also get hefty military pensions and many sit on the boards of defense contractorsthrough their military work these mentors have access to sensitive information that can be leveraged into unbeatable business advice for companies — boeing for example — looking for government contracts who in turn pay durango for the privilege while the firm and officers might see this as synergy others see it as an ethical breach the watchdog group public citizen called it an “amazing conflict of interest” in an interview with usa todaythe story on durango is the latest in an excellent usa today series on the growing senior mentors program the series has prompted defense secretary bob gates to order a review of the programbut durango doesn’t seem embarrassed by the arrangement it advertises its consultants’ special ties to the military on its web site conflict of interest rules don’t apply because mentors are technically contractors for the military not employeesdurango founder gen ronald fogleman who retired as chief of staff of the air force in  himself has worked as a senior mentor for the militaryusa today reports that in his capacity as a mentor fogleman took part in a major air force space war game in  at that war game new tech concepts including a longrange unmanned drone were tested out soon after boeing one of fogleman’s clients announced it was developing such a drone for military usesthe whole story on durango is here

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
