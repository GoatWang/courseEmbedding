hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer clenbuterol hardy said she had never heard of the substance attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage at the time hardy had been taking the supplement arginine extreme which she had received for free from advocare in exchange for making product testimonials and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the companys product was tainted advocare sued hardy for making false claims an arbitration hearing reduced hardys suspension after a scientific expert testified that the advocare product was tainted advocare disputed the panels findings saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of clenbuterol in the supplements in  a dallas county jury awarded  million in damages against advocare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors according to the lawsuit litigants bruce and teresa badgett of arlington texas had been active and profitable marketers of advocare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in  based upon vague and trumpedup charges the jury found that advocare engaged in false misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with advocare were unconscionable according to court documents advocare disputed the ruling and on april   filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the texas deceptive trade practices act the appeal was dismissed on march   and the company was ordered to reimburse the badgetts for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case advocare ceased offering kickstart spark targeted to youth age  after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing  mg of caffeine advocare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events in  the company paid  to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in sacramento but after negative publicity advocare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events wendy miller of the beaumont weight control center said advocares herbal cleanse is probably safe for many users but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products in march  advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in espn the magazine the exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signingup of new distributors rather than sales of the product while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money that the company creates a cultlike atmosphere of not questioning the companys claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the companys strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members see alsoedit companies

richard w read preview academic journal article the review of litigation the principles of product liability by wright richard w read preview article excerpt i introduction more than any other area of tort law the law of product liability has been the subject of continuing debate regarding the interrelated issues of its proper rationales and grounds of liability although the seeds of the debate go back at least  years it flowered into its mature form in  in escola v coca cola bottling co in which the majority of the california supreme court used an expansive application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine to hold the defendant liable for inferred negligence in a concurring opinion justice roger traynor relied on four different rationalesefficient compensation efficient deterrence inferred negligence and consumer expectationsto argue that liability for defective products should be strict almost twenty years later in  traynors rationales and position were ratified and adopted in an opinion that he wrote for a unanimous court in greenman v yuba power products inc the greenman opinion was a catalyst for the adoption of strict product liability based on the same rationales in restatement second section a which in turn was rapidly adopted by most states in the united states and greatly influenced the adoption of product liability laws in other countries however as the courts attempted to apply strict liability as articulated in section a renewed debate developed on the proper extent and grounds of product liability by the time the restatement third was being drafted it was generally agreed at least among the courts that liability for construction defects should be strict and that liability for warning defects should be based on negligence while considerable disagreement remained about the proper grounds of liability for design defects the restatement third continues to invoke all four of the rationales that traynor set forth in escolaand a few moreto support strict liability for construction defects but it asserts that those rationales do not support strict liability for design or warning defects which it claims are predicated on a different concept of responsibility and were not prominent in the cases or a subject of significant consideration at the time that restatement second section a was drafted and adopted it is true that at the time that section a was adopted no clear distinction was drawn between construction defects and design or warning defects but this is not because little consideration was given to design or warning defects but rather because the prevailing academic and judicial view was that there was no need to distinguish the types of defect since it was assumed that strict liability should apply regardless of the type of defect greenman itself involved a design defect which the court loosely described as a defect in design and manufacture and section a clearly was meant to encompass design and warning defects as well as construction defects their inclusion was the reason for the insertion of the mischievous phrase unreasonably dangerous in section a this phrase along with repetitive language in comments h through k was intended to preclude strict liability for generic product risks if but only if those risks were unavoidable aspects of a useful and reasonably safe product and proper warnings were provided the restatement thirds rote invocation of the efficiency rationales is unfortunate not merely because they are normatively unappealing but also because they fail to explain or justify the differential treatment of construction defects and design and warning defects or indeed any of the content or structure of past or current product liability law which however can be explained and justified by traynors other rationales which are based on interactive justice rather than efficiency except for its making the existence of a reasonable alternative design an independent requirement that the plaintiff must prove to establish a design defect rather than only a factor to be considered in its consumeroriented riskutility analysis of reasonableness the restatement thirds substantive provisions and comments present a generally accurate description of current product liability law … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this
