what’s wrong with the market today kelly evans thursday  jun    am etcnbccom shares show chapters value spark bob olstein on netflix    thursday  jun    am et   dont get bob olstein started on netflix or cisco or tesla when it comes to investing the veteran fund manager said there are three key things he looks at price price and price thats why he prefers walt disney — which he says still has  percent of upside — to netflix which is currently trading north of  times estimated  earnings to watch kellys full indepth interview with bob olstein click here  as for any problems with disneys juggernaut espn he argues its slow growth is already priced in and that hell trade growth for strong free cash flow — another of his musts — any day tesla motors elon musk is probably one of the brightest human beings in the history of mankind olstein said but free cash flow is our mantra olstein whose purchase new yorkbased olstein funds oversees a number of mutual funds such as the allcap value fund he launched in  shared his views in the latest cnbc pro value spark interview  never one to keep quiet about injustices he perceives olstein also inveighed against market forecasters passive investing exchangetraded funds earnings manipulation heavy stockbased compensation and what he calls the wall street spin machine take cisco systems im supposed to trust wall street research that in a ninemonth period changed its value of cisco by  billion — twice he admonished we like to sit out here rip balance sheets and income statements apart make investment decisions rather than market decisions he said indeed that is why olstein vehemently defends the cost of his mutual funds his allcap fund has a high fee according to morningstar with a  percent expense ratio do you believe that if youre sick you should go to the cheapest doctor we spend our fees on doing research and picking good stocks to invest in he said and funds like his are better and even safer for many retail investors than newer cheaper exchangetraded funds he argued in etfs weve had two little mini crashes already he said on top of that anybody who tries to trade our fund  always sells us at bottoms and buys us at tops show chapters value spark bob olstein on the mutual fund industry    thursday  jun    am et   the only advantage of an etf over a mutual fund olstein said is for trading his allcap fund he added has turned a  investment in  into  after fees today as for the poor performance lately of many actively managed funds particularly hedge funds he said its probably true that only  percent to  percent of the professionals are above average he is equally upset by market professionals who make calls or predictions on where the market is headed adding i dont care whether its bill gross  or jeffrey gundlach  or stanley druckenmiller while many of them have been successful traders or even have made prescient calls on the market in the past he said the idea that the market can be consistently forecast is as plausible as discovering a fountain of youth getting back to his current stock picks olstein actually likes cisco today along with legg mason oracle zimmer biomet holdings keysight technologies and retailers like kohls macys and bed bath  beyond isnt bed bath an example of dying oldschool retail not to olstein who emphasizes that he sees the company generating  per share in free cash flow in the next couple years and that the shares are worth more like  versus the  they trade for today he is staying away from the big banks though we got burned by derivatives in  he said i dont understand them i dont want to understand them so he is avoiding the big banks only because of the derivative exposure on the markets overall olstein added a final warning the benchmark sp  was much more conservative  years ago he said today it has prominent members like netflix amazoncom and facebook — growthy companies trading at high multiples in new fields like social networking i dont think the markets a bubble he said its just a different mentality kelly evansclosing bell coanchor related securities symbol price   change change sp   dis  to view this site you need to have
