first this vision became a reality later that year when levitt and bird founded albion financial group a feeonly registered investment advisor ria legally and culturally committed to each client’s

pressure to do anything but what’s right for each client our investment relationships begin with a facetoface conversation this allows albion and potential clients to discuss financial goals and investment philosophies—laying the foundation for a personalized and integrated longterm investment plan one team a world of options managing multiple portfolios or advisors is neither convenient nor
