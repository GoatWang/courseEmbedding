that intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items inside of backpacks carryon luggage and suitcases we plan on generating revenues by

related stockholder matters and issuer purchase of equity securities   market information   there is currently no established public trading market for our common shares   our shares of common stock are approved for trading on the otc markets under the ticker symbol “nink” trading in stocks quoted on the otc markets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects    otc markets securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange instead otc markets securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks otc markets issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange   number of holders   as of april   the company had a total of  shares issued and outstanding which were held by a total of  shareholders of record   dividends   no cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal year ended november   we have not paid any cash dividends since inception and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future    recent sales of unregistered securities   none    in october  the company’s board of directors approved a  forward split  all share and per share amounts herein reflect the impact of the forward split   item  selected financial data   not applicable    item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report   this report contains forward looking statements relating to our companys future economic performance plans and objectives of management for future operations projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to our management the words expects” “intends” “believes” “anticipates” “may” “could” “should and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forwardlooking statements the cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement        table of contents   our auditor’s report on our november   financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business since our officers and directors may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next  months we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans see “november   audited financial statements  auditors report”   as of november   the company had  cash compared to  in cash on as of november   management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised we plan to satisfy our future cash requirements by additional equity financing this will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock   management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof however additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements   if the company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operations to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing we would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in the company’s common stock would lose all of their investment   the development and marketing of our products is expected to begin over the next  months the company does not anticipate obtaining any further products or services   we did not generate any revenue during the fiscal year ended november   as of the fiscal year ended november   and november   we had  and  of cash on hand in the bank respectively we incurred operating expenses in the amount of  for the fiscal year ended november   compared to operating expenses of  for the fiscal year ended november   these operating expenses were comprised of professional fees and office and general expenses   the company intends to become a holding company with the objective of systematically acquiring assets in the form of profitable companies to be acquired throughout the asian region providing consistent attractive returns to its investments   however the company has no current plans preliminary or otherwise to merge with any other entity   off balance sheet arrangements   the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the company’s financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors the term “offbalance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party under which the company has i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract derivative instrument or variable interest or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such

de under the exchange act disclosure controls and procedures are defined as those controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports it files or submits under the act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on that evaluation he concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in gathering analyzing and disclosing information needed to satisfy the registrant’s disclosure obligations under the exchange act based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures our company’s principal executive and principal financial officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form k our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae or de under the exchange act are not effective because of the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures which is identified below it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote”   the material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows       lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions the company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions      audit committee and financial expert  the company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and thus the company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process   we intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including but not necessarily limited to the following     · establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the chief executive officer the chief financial officer and the company’s corporate legal counsel         · form an audit committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the board of directors a formal review process that will among other things assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently        table of contents   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act internal control over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected   as of november   management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on this evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting are not effective as of november   in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework based on that evaluation they concluded that as of november   such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that the company’s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives  insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the companys chief financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of november   and communicated to our management   management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items   and  above did not have an affect on the companys financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the companys determination to its financial statements for the future years   we are committed to improving our financial organization as part of this commitment we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the company i appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and ii preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements   management believes that the appointment of more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board in addition management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses i insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements and ii ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes further management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur this coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future        table of contents   we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements as necessary and as funds allow   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended november   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s
