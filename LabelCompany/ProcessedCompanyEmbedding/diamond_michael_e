industry definition michael porters cluster or competitive cluster is a geographical location where enough resources and competences amass and reach a critical threshold giving it a key position in a given economic branch of activity with a decisive sustainable competitive advantage over others places or even a world supremacy in that field generally two types of competitive clusters based on different kinds of knowledge are recognized techno clusters  these clusters are high technologyoriented well adapted to the knowledge economy and typically have as a core renowned universities and research centers historic knowhowbased clusters  these are based on more traditional activities that maintain their advantage in knowhow over the years and for some of them over the centuries they are often industry specific the concept is named after michael porter a harvard professor who developed it he claims that clusters have the potential to affect competition in three ways by increasing the productivity of the companies in the cluster by driving innovation in the field by stimulating new businesses in the field the process of identifying defining and describing a cluster is not standardized individual economic consultants and researchers develop their own methodologies all cluster analysis relies on evaluation of local and regional employment patterns based on sic codes an alternative to clusters reflecting the distributed nature of business operations in the wake of globalization is hubs and nodes examples well known examples are the silicon valley in california in the field of computer technology bangalore in india for software outsourcing paris in france for haute couture toulouse in france for aerospace cambridge in the uk for biotechnology and electronic belgian

national playing field that countries establish for their industries porters diamond of national advantage the individual points on the diamond and the diamond as a whole affect four ingredients that lead to a national comparative advantage these ingredients are  the availability of resources and skills  information that firms use to decide which opportunities to pursue with those resources and skills  the goals of individuals in companies  the pressure on companies to innovate and invest the points of the diamond are described as follows factor conditions a country creates its own important factors such as skilled resources and technological base the stock of factors at a given time is less important than the extent that they are upgraded and deployed local disadvantages in factors of production force innovation adverse conditions such as labor shortages or scarce raw materials force firms to develop new methods and this innovation often leads to a national comparative advantage demand conditions when the market for a particular product is larger locally than in foreign markets the local firms devote more attention to that product than do foreign firms leading to a competitive advantage when the local firms begin exporting the product a more demanding local market leads to national advantage a strong trendsetting local market helps local firms anticipate global trends related and supporting industries when local supporting industries are competitive firms enjoy more cost effective and innovative inputs this effect is strengthened when the suppliers themselves are strong global competitors firm strategy structure and rivalry local conditions affect firm strategy for example german companies tend to be hierarchical italian companies tend to be smaller and are run more like extended families such strategy and structure helps to determine in which types of industries a nations firms will excel in porters five forces model low rivalry made an industry attractive while at a single point in time a firm prefers less rivalry over the long run more local rivalry is better since it puts pressure on firms to innovate and improve in fact high local rivalry results in less global rivalry local rivalry forces firms to move beyond basic advantages that the home country may enjoy such as low factor costs the diamond as a system the effect of one point depends on the others for example factor disadvantages will not lead firms to innovate unless there is sufficient rivalry the diamond also is a selfreinforcing system for example a high level of rivalry often leads to the formation of unique specialized factors governments role the role of government in the model is to encourage companies to raise their performance for example by enforcing strict product standards stimulate early demand for advanced products focus on specialized factor creation stimulate local rivalry by limiting direct cooperation and enforcing antitrust regulations chance can play a role also application to the japanese fax machine industry the japanese facsimile industry illustrates the diamond of national advantage japanese firms achieved dominance

authorporter michael e countryunited states period typemodel roleconsultant and manager activityanalyse and plan topicstrategic management and culture  internationalisation abstr levelenvironment perspectiverational statusfor review moduleclassics i comments   advertising   description in the mids professor michael porter of harvard business school developed a framework to assess the competitiveness of regions states and nationsin the early s us industry saw its economic competitiveness eroded by japanese and european competitors porter concluded that classical international trade theories which mainly focused on slowly changing “inherited” variables such as natural resources climate size of working population etc could only partially explain why nations gain competitive advantage in a given industry this observation initiated a four year study of ten major trading nations and  industries that covered  of total world exports in  successful international industries tend to be located within particular cities and regions geographic concentration is vital for firms to efficiently draw on each others resources and capabilities and to benefit from a shared culture and learning experience supply capabilities and local infrastructure industry clusters are geographical concentrations of interconnected businesses suppliers and associated institutions in a particular field clusters lead to productivity increases higher innovation rates and faster new business developments porter argued that productivity is the main factor for international competitiveness and that the standard of living of a country’s population can be improved as a direct result of increases in that factor clusters may take different forms between firms producing different products across valueadded chains or between firms producing similar products at different stages of the same chain examples are banking in london and new york chemical transport in rotterdam houston and singapore film in mumbai and hollywood and internetsoftware in silicon valley and bangaloreporter’s diamond of competitive advantage model of nations consists of four main attributes that shape the national environment in which local connected firms compete factor conditionsthe nation’s relative position in vital industrial production factors such as skilled labour or infrastructure are important determinants of national competiveness both the level of individual factors and the overall composition of the resource mix must be considered factors can be country specific or industry specific for example japan’s large pool of engineers  reflected by a much higher number of engineering graduates per capita than almost any other nation  has been vital to japan’s success in many manufacturing industries demand conditionsthe nature of home demand for an industry’s products and services requires considering both the quantity and quality of the demand for example japan’s sophisticated and knowledgeable buyers of cameras helped stimulate the japanese camera industry to improve product quality and to launch new innovative models related and supporting industriesthe presence or absence in the nation of internationally competitive supplier and related industries is a key factor until the mids for example the technological leadership in the us semiconductor industry provided the basis for us success in personal computers and several other technically advanced electronic products adoption of the automobile took off in the usa after the construction of a national system of highways and gas stations  firm strategy structure and rivalrythe national conditions that determine how companies are created organised and managed as well as the nature and extent of domestic rivalry for example the predominance of engineers on the topmanagement teams of german and japanese firms results in emphasising the improvement of the manufacturing processes and product design furthermore domestic rivalry creates pressure to launch new products to improve quality to reduce costs and to invest in new more advanced technologiesporter stated two additional variables that indirectly influence the diamond chance eventsdisruptive developments outside the control of firms and governments that allow in  new players who exploit opportunities arising from a reshaped industry structure for example radical innovations unexpected oil prise rises revolutions wars etc    governmentgovernment choice of policies can influence each of the four determinants successful government policies work in those industries where underlying determinants of national advantage are present and reinforced by government actions government can raise the odds of gaining competitive advantage but lacks the power to create advantages on its ownthese six attributes promote or impede the creation of competitive advantages of firms clusters and nations all conditions need to be present and favourable for an industrycompany within a country to attain global supremacy managers can use the diamond model during their internationalisation efforts to determine if the home market can support and sustain a successful internationalisation effort or to asses in which country to invest next the model helps entrepreneurs decide where to start their next venture government officials can use the model for guidance on how to best build a supporting policy framework for a given industry assets diamond model provenmodels editor pm version   kb   factor conditions matrix provenmodels editor pm version   kb   industry cluster sample provenmodels editor pm version   kb   pros porters diamond model explains why corporations domiciled in certain countries are successful in penetrating foreign markets this model can be used to assess competitive advantage of the national environment in which individual business units organisations or industries operate   the model helps to understand the dynamic interplay between a firms corporate strategy and the competitive advantages of a country  the habitat in which organisations operate this model is an addition to porters five forces model dealing with industry structure the diamond model emphasises that a firm should only internationalise when it has a strong position in its home market   the model provides an explanation of why industry clusters are relevant   governments can play an active role in supporting the development of clusters countering the notion of public laissezfair   the model shows that apart from interfirm rivalry cooperation is a vital component of corporate strategy companies should form strategic alliances especially with organisations in related and supporting industries   the model explains in part the resource curse  why a large natural resources base is not sufficient to develop industrial might   cons the situation in which all four attributes are correctly lined up to boost the development of a given industry provides only a higher probability that an industry will develop its development depends on personal action for the favourable conditions to be fully commercially exploited   the absence of any of the four conditions from the diamond domestically may not inhibit companies and industries from becoming globally competitive for example if related and supporting industries are not available locally materials and components can be easily brought in from abroad because of advancements in transportation and the relaxation of import restrictions   capacity gets created by better allocation of resources due to the pressure of competition the model pays no direct attention to competence building   the level of importance of chance as a nucleus for change is not clear how much change is needed to make the transition to a globally competitive economic cluster   cooperation directly between rivals is considered non advantageous due to the reason that it decreases the strength of rivalry this view does not always hold eg when  based on cooperation  industry standards get developed that grow the overall market   the importance of exchange rates and wage rates in the determination of competitiveness is overlooked no comparative data for wages price levels or cost levels in manufacturing were listed in the country fact files in porters  volume   the impact of virtual clusters where participants located across countries collaborate via internet on porters model has not been determined   the model assumes that national free markets exist where firms compete headtohead this is not the case in many countries on this globe   porter placed perhaps a too great an emphasis on the role of home based companies when the driving force is the multinational company   moon rugman  verbeke argued that the porter diamond framework is useful in a single country context but as so much of a nations activity takes place in a regional international or global context it is important to consider the trade relationships between countries to gain a full understanding at the nation level a double diamond framework was proposed to consider the trade space between two countries   references cluster profile database harvard business school press united states   competitive advantage of
