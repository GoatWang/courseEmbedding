drug designations product candidates our primary pharmaceutical product platform consists of our experimental compound ampligen® our fda approved natural interferon product alferon n injection® and our experimental liquid natural interferon for oral administration alferon® ldo low dose oral ampligen®  ampligen® is an experimental drug currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome cfs the fda has so far declined to approve our nda for the treatment of cfs with ampligen® and has requested that we generate additional clinical data over its developmental history ampligen® has received various designations including orphan drug product designation fda treatment protocol eg “expanded access” or “compassionate” use authorization with cost recovery authorization fda and “promising” clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports “ahrq” or agency for healthcare research and quality ampligen® represents the first drug in the class of large macromolecular rna nucleic acid molecules to apply for nda review based on the results of published peer reviewed preclinical studies and clinical trials we believe that ampligen® may have broadspectrum antiviral and anticancer properties alferon n injection®  alferon n injection® is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon which was approved by the fda in  for the treatment of certain categories of genital warts alferon® is the only naturalsource multispecies alpha interferon currently approved for sale in the us for the intralesional within lesions treatment of refractory resistant to other treatment or recurring external genital warts in patients  years of age or older certain types of human papilloma viruses “hpv” cause genital warts a sexually transmitted disease “std” the us centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” estimates that “approximately twenty million americans are currently infected with hpv with another six million becoming newly infected each year hpv is so common that at least  of sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives” although they do not usually result in death genital warts commonly recur causing significant morbidity and entail substantial health care costs interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon alpha beta gamma and omega alferon n injection® contains a multispecies form of alpha interferon the worldwide market for injectable alpha interferonbased products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways by genetic engineering by cell culture and from human white blood cells all three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the us our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells the potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant synthetic interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon in contrast commercial recombinant alpha interferon products each contain only a single species researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated partially covered with sugar molecules such glycosylation is not present on the currently us marketed recombinant alpha interferons we believe that the absence of glycosylation may be in part responsible for the production of interferonneutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon although cell culturederived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon  alferon n injection® interferon alfan human leukocyte derived is a highly purified naturalsource glycosylated multispecies alpha interferon product there are essentially no neutralizing antibodies observed against alferon n injection® to date and the product has a relatively low sideeffect profile the recombinant dna derived alpha interferon formulations have been reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year probably due to neutralizing antibody formation alferon® ldo low dose oral  alferon® ldo low dose oral interferon alfan human leukocyte derived is an experimental lowdose oral liquid formulation of natural alpha interferon and like alferon n injection® should not cause antibody formation which is a problem with recombinant interferon it is an experimental immunotherapeutic believed to work by stimulating an immune cascade response in the cells of the mouth and throat enabling it to bolster systemic immune response through the entire body by absorption through the oral mucosa oral interferon could be economically feasible for patients and logistically manageable globally for development programs for prevention and or treatment of pandemic influenza seasonal influenza and other emerging viruses oral administration of alferon® ldo with its anticipated affordability low toxicity no production of antibodies and broad range of potential bioactivity could be a breakthrough treatment or preventative for viral diseases site map  privacy  terms of use copyright   hemispherx biopharma inc  all rights reserved stocks index  markets index bulletin investor alert stocks rates funds bonds
