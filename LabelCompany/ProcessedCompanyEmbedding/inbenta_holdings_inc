what it is used for form d disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors the information in form d is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t

services analyzing browsing on our website if you continue to browse you agree to use you can get more information on our cookie policy x the meaningtext theory  inbenta technology the meaningtext theory meaningtext theory the unique theoretical linguistic framework that uses lexical functions to compute semantics a groundbreaking theoretical linguistic framework the meaningtext theory mtt is a unique ai method that uses lexical functions to compute semantics we’ve implemented software based on the way meaningtext theory conceives natural language from lexicon to semantics which has led our linguistic team to create detailed and specific descriptions of the lexical units in a number of different languages   the two men behind the mtt model first put forward in moscow by aleksandr žolkovskij and igor mel’čuk mtt is a theoretical linguistic framework for the construction of models of natural language a theory that provides a large and elaborate basis for linguistic description and due to its formal character lends itself particularly well to computer ai applications   the power of lexical function one important discovery of meaning–text linguistics was the recognition that the elements in the lexicon lexical units of a language can be related to one another in an abstract semantic sense these relations are represented in mtt as lexical functions lf thus the description of the lexicon in a crucial aspect of our software lexical functions are a tool designed to formally represent the relations between lexical units this allows us to formalize and describe — in a relatively simple manner — the complex network of lexical relationships within languages and assign a corresponding semantic weight to each element in a sentence most importantly they allow us to relate analogous meanings no matter which form they’re presented in   the meaning in mtt natural languages are more restrictive than they may seem at first glance in the majority of cases we encounter frozen expressions sooner or later and although these have varying degrees of rigidity ultimately they are fixed and must be described according to some characteristic for example obtain a result do a favor ask  pose a question raise a building all of these examples show us that it’s the lexicon that imposes selection restrictions since we would hardly find “do a question” or “raise a favor” in a text indeed the most important factor when analyzing these phrases is that from a meaning point of view the elements don’t have the same semantic value as illustrated in the examples above the first element provides little information with all of the meaning or semantic weight provided by the second element the crucial matter here is that the semantic relationship between the first and second element is exactly the same in every example roughly what we’re saying is “make x” a result a joke a favor a question a building this type of relation can be represented by the “oper” lexical function   complexity is easy for our linguists mtt collects around  different types of lexical functions this allows among other things the description of relations such as synonymy buying and purchasing are identical actions hypernymy and hyponymy a dog is a type of animal and other relations among lexical units at the sentence level this includes the oper that we mentioned before or ones expressing the concept “a lot” ie if you smoke a lot you are a heavy smoker but if you sleep a lot you are not a “heavy sleeper” all we can say is that you sleep like a logour linguists adapt the principles of the meaningtext theory while describing the languages supported user questions may be completely different on the surface but the questions underlying meaning is the same and thus correctly understood by our semanticbased searches the upshot is that users get fast accurate results from their queries   another example of mtt in action let’s take these user questions purchasing a ticket for an overweight person i want to buy a ticket for someone who is obese even though the words are different the meaning conveyed is the same way in both cases so both will get the same answer from a virtual assistant at inbenta our semantic search engine is built within a rich and complex network of lexical relations so that it understands what users mean with their queries regardless of the exact words they use to pose their questions do you want to know more about how to integrate inbenta in your website we can create a demo tailored to your needs complete with live examples and the search results

clustering  inbenta technology semantic clustering the science behind the search content discovery  gap analysis semantic clustering helps your company discover gaps in your content to enrich your customer’s experience how exactly does semantic clustering work inbenta’s semantic clustering groups semantically equivalent search queries — words phrases and sentences — into clusters based on meaning the higher the number of questions words and phrases with a similar meaning the greater the cluster imagine you find a piece of a puzzle in the middle of the street you are unlikely to know what image it is a part of inbenta’s semantic clustering is able to locate and put together this piece with the rest of the puzzle of similar unanswered questions to give you a complete picture of how you can fill your knowledge gap when is semantic clustering used customers react negatively when their search results in an unsatisfactory answer they will either fail to click on what has been provided or will indicate their unhappiness with the response by leaving the page or getting in touch with you this means the customer did not receive an answer the answer for that cluster was not precise enough or that it was incorrect this is a good indicator of missing information that customers value and consequently needs to be created inbenta can map all these negative signals and discover where customers have had similar inquiries but did not receive a satisfactory response these negative responses alert the company to crucial new material that needs to be created in order to answer their customers’ questions this is a huge advantage as it enables businesses to see what their customers want to know and respond with better targeted content that improves customer satisfaction have you got an example an airlines company might receive a number of unanswered queries about what time the gates close for boarding of course humans are unique and will ask this question in a number of different ways “what time should i arrive” “when do gates close” “boarding time” these questions or statements all use different words or phrases but mean the same thing inbenta’s semantic clustering is able to group all of these responses together into a cluster with the same meaning – essentially when the passenger should arrive at the airport for their flight how semantic clustering helps you our gap analysis function allows our customers to discover where they need to add additional answers and information to make sure their customers can find the information they want quickly and easily without having to raise a support ticket the gap in the company’s knowledge base is reduced and the customer’s satisfaction is significantly increased chatbots semantic clustering on a more personal level semantic clustering is also utilized in our chatbots which can improve the quality of conversations and provide a more interactive experience for the customer   do

the fastest time to market integrating inbenta will be fast and easy for your development team below is a breakout of our technology solutions integrating the inbenta selfservice application we have extensive possibilities for you to plug in the selfservice application and semantic search engine to your website or any other type of application our most popular integration is html plus we have a number of other technology options that will fit most any web browser   integrating the inbenta knowledge base you’ll get our fullfeatured knowledge base manager with a choice of two options with which to integrate your knowledge base  you can use inbenta backstage analytics our crm tool that lets you edit the content and store it in our cloud infrastructure  you can edit the content in your own infrastructure or website and use our web crawler to index your knowledge base into inbenta if you have your content in zendesk we use their secure apis to access the zendesk knowledge base and then implement inbenta    natural language search on top of zendesk’s for your developers our guide for javascript highlevel apis popups frames or iframes and lightbox • integrating with javascript this is the easiest quickest and more versatile integration mechanism you’d include one line of javascript that would access inbenta functionality through a script that establishes a jsonp communication directly between the user’s web browser and inbenta servers the script handles any search events required to power the user interface and it integrates the answer into the existing page structure • integrating with highlevel apis if you decide to handle the presentation layer of the inbenta semantic search engine yourself we’ll provide a high level api using either json xml or soap
