billion which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads us steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale reduce transportation and resource costs expand product lines and improve distribution it was also planned to allow the united states to compete globally with the united kingdom and germany schwab and others claimed that us steels size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets globalization us steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges ships railroad cars and rails wire nails and a host of other products with us steel morgan had captured twothirds of the steel market and schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a  percent market share however after  the business market share dropped schwab resigned from us steel in  to form bethlehem steel which became the second largest us steel producer labor policy was a contentious issue us steel was nonunion and experienced steel producers led by schwab wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive

us steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits morgan controlled us steel and he decided it had to buy the tci stock from moore and schley elbert gary head of us steel agreed but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for us steel which was already dominant in the steel industry morgan sent gary to see president theodore roosevelt who promised legal immunity for the deal us steel thereupon paid  million for the tci stock and moore and schley was saved the announcement had an immediate effect by november   the panic was over the crisis

twothirds of the steel market and schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a  percent market share however after  the business market share dropped schwab resigned from us steel in  to

business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges ships railroad cars and rails wire nails and a host of other products with us steel morgan had captured twothirds of the steel market and schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a  percent market share however after  the business market share dropped schwab resigned from us steel in  to form bethlehem steel which became the second largest us steel producer labor policy was a contentious issue us steel was nonunion and experienced steel producers led by schwab wanted to keep it that

tennessee coal iron and railroad company moore and schley had pledged over  million of the tennessee coal and iron tci stock for loans among the wall street banks the banks had called the loans and the firm could not pay if moore and schley should fail a hundred more failures would follow and then all wall street might go to pieces morgan decided they had to save moore and schley tci was one of the chief competitors of us steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits morgan controlled us steel and he decided it had to buy the tci stock from moore and schley elbert gary head of us steel agreed but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for us steel which was already dominant in the steel industry morgan sent gary to see president theodore

trust by susanne craig october    pm october    pm james gibbardtulsa worldjudge linda g morrissey of the tulsa county district court in oklahoma  pm  updated trust accounts require advisers to be even more diligent in putting the interests of clients ahead of the banks’ this week an oklahoma judge found that jpmorgan chase had been “grossly negligent and reckless” in its administration of one client’s trust account and ordered the bank to pay  million in a harshly worded opinion released late tuesday judge linda g morrissey of the tulsa county district court in oklahoma said that the bank had breached a series of fiduciary duties in its handling of the trust of carolyn s burford an oil heiress who died in  the court also ordered jpmorgan to pay punitive damages to be set at a later date along with the trust’s legal fees judge morrissey concluded that jpmorgan had breached its fiduciary duty in  when it sold what are known as variable prepaid forward contracts to the trust a complex feerich product that the judge determined was unsuitable for the trust “we disagree with the court’s decision and will take all appropriate measures to respond including appealing the decision” jpmorgan said in a statement erin donovan a lawyer for one of the burford family members praised the ruling “i think the judge was affronted by the fact that jpmorgan which was in a position of trust betrayed it for their own benefit” this case is likely to put a spotlight on trust accounts under the current law some stockbrokers are required to act in a customer’s best interest — but that is a lessstringent standard that allows them to sell products that are suitable but not necessarily in a client’s best interest brokers who handle trust accounts are held to the higher standard and have to do what is best for the client alone the contracts in this case were pitched as a way to generate more income for the trust which was established in  by ms burford’s parents the trust now benefits ann fletcher ms burford’s daughter carolyn burford’s father founded skelly oil and her mother had ties with another oil company the trust initially contained a significant amount of exxon mobil stock jpmorgan and the trust entered into several variable prepaid forward contracts from  to  the judge found that jpmorgan which ended up with the account after a series of bank mergers had not properly explained the product to its client and had failed to disclose that the bank was benefiting from the transaction the bank also breached its duty when it invested the proceeds of the contracts in its own investment products which the judge said “amounted to double dipping” that was unreasonable “the bank provided incentives to its employees to generate revenue for the bank this created a situation in which the selfinterest of employees managing and advising fiduciary accounts was placed in conflict with the interest of those to whom the bank owed fiduciary duties” the judge wrote the misconduct in the case the judge added showed a serious disregard for customers of the bank which was aware “or recklessly failed to be aware” of the conduct at issue “the court finds that beyond simply restoring the trust in the position in which it should have been maintained it is appropriate to assess punitive damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the bank for its conduct” judge morrissey wrote correction october   an earlier version of this article misstated the jurisdiction of judge linda g morrissey she is a district judge for the tulsa county district court which is a state court in oklahoma not for the united states district court which is also in tulsa whats next loading previous post business day live official warmth and public rage for merkel in

investment strategies and policies as noted in the applicable prospectuses for each of the funds in addition to the main investment strategy and the main investment risks described in the prospectuses each fund may employ other investment strategies and may be subject to other risks which are described below the funds may engage in the practices described below to the extent consistent with their investment objectives strategies policies and restrictions however no fund is required to engage in any particular transaction or purchase any particular type of securities or investment even if to do so might benefit the fund because the following is a combined description of investment strategies of all of the funds i certain matters described herein may not apply to particular funds and ii certain references to the adviser may also include a subadviser as the context requires for a list of investment strategies and policies employed by each fund see “investment practices” in part i of this sai assetbacked securities assetbacked securities consist of securities secured by company receivables home equity loans truck and auto loans leases or credit card receivables assetbacked securities also include other securities backed by other types of receivables or other assets including collateralized debt obligations “cdos” which include collateralized bond obligations “cbos” collateralized loan obligations “clos” and other similarly structured securities such assets are generally securitized through the use of trusts or special purpose corporations assetbacked securities are backed by a pool of assets representing the obligations often of a number of different parties certain of these securities may be illiquid assetbacked securities are generally subject to the risks of the underlying assets in addition assetbacked securities in general are subject to certain additional risks including depreciation damage or loss of the collateral backing the security failure of the collateral to generate the anticipated cash flow or in certain cases more rapid prepayment because of events affecting the collateral such as accelerated prepayment of loans backing these securities or destruction of equipment subject to equipment trust certificates in addition the underlying assets for example the underlying credit card debt may be refinanced or paid off prior to maturity during periods of declining interest rates changes in prepayment rates can result in greater price and yield volatility if assetbacked securities are prepaid a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds from the securities at a lower rate potential market gains on a security subject to prepayment risk may be more limited than potential market gains on a comparable security that is not subject to prepayment risk under certain prepayment rate scenarios a fund may fail to recover additional amounts paid ie premiums for securities with higher interest rates resulting in an unexpected loss a cbo is a trust or other special purpose entity “spe” which is typically backed by a diversified pool of fixed income securities which may include high risk below investment grade securities a clo is a trust or other spe that is typically collateralized by a pool of loans which may include among others domestic and nonus senior secured loans senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans although certain cdos may receive credit enhancement in the form of a seniorsubordinate structure overcollateralization or bond insurance such enhancement may not always be present and may fail to protect a fund against the risk of loss on default of the collateral certain cdos may use derivatives contracts to create “synthetic” exposure to assets rather than holding such assets directly which entails the risks of derivative instruments described elsewhere in this sai cdos may charge management fees and administrative expenses which are in addition to those of a fund for both cbos and clos the cash flows from the spe are split into two or more portions called tranches varying in risk and yield the riskiest portion is the “equity” tranche which bears the first loss from defaults from the bonds or loans in the spe and serves to protect the other more senior tranches from default though such protection is not complete since it is partially protected from defaults a senior tranche from a cbo or clo typically has higher ratings and lower yields than its underlying securities and may be rated investment grade despite the protection from the equity tranche cbo or clo tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults downgrades of the underlying collateral by rating agencies forced liquidation of the collateral pool due to a failure of coverage tests increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches market anticipation of defaults as well as investor aversion to cbo or clo securities as a class interest on certain tranches of a cdo may be paid in kind or deferred and capitalized paid in the form of obligations of the same type rather than cash which involves continued exposure to default risk with respect to such payments the risks of an investment in a cdo depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the cdo in which a fund invests normally cbos clos and other cdos are privately offered and sold and thus are   not registered under the securities laws as a result investments in cdos may be characterized by a fund as illiquid securities however an active dealer market may exist for cdos allowing a cdo to qualify for rule a transactions in addition to the normal risks associated with fixed income securities and assetbacked securities generally discussed elsewhere in this sai cdos carry additional risks including but not limited to i the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments ii the risk that the collateral may default or decline in value or be downgraded if rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” iii a fund may invest in tranches of cdos that are subordinate to other tranches iv the structure and complexity of the transaction and the legal documents could lead to disputes among investors regarding the characterization of proceeds v the investment return achieved by the fund could be significantly different than those predicted by financial models vi the lack of a readily available secondary market for cdos vii risk of forced “fire sale” liquidation due to technical defaults such as coverage test failures and viii the cdo’s manager may perform poorly total annual fund operating expenses set forth in the fee table and financial highlights section of each fund’s prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain structured or synthetic products that may rely on the exception for the definition of “investment company” provided by section c or c of the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” auction rate securities auction rate securities consist of auction rate municipal securities and auction rate preferred securities sold through an auction process issued by closedend investment companies municipalities and governmental agencies for more information on risks associated with municipal securities see “municipal securities” below provided that the auction mechanism is successful auction rate securities usually permit the holder to sell the securities in an auction at par value at specified intervals the dividend is reset by “dutch” auction in which bids are made by brokerdealers and other institutions for a certain amount of securities at a specified minimum yield the dividend rate set by the auction is the lowest interest or dividend rate that covers all securities offered for sale while this process is designed to permit auction rate securities to be traded at par value there is the risk that an auction will fail due to insufficient demand for the securities since february  numerous auctions have failed due to insufficient demand for securities and have continued to fail for an extended period of time failed auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of auction rate securities investments although some issuers of auction rate securities are redeeming or are considering redeeming such securities such issuers are not obligated to do so and therefore there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for a fund’s investments in auction rate securities at a time when the fund wishes to dispose of such securities dividends on auction rate preferred securities issued by a closedend fund may be designated as exempt from federal income tax to the extent they are attributable to taxexempt interest income earned by the closedend fund on the securities in its portfolio and distributed to holders of the preferred securities however such designation may be made only if the closedend fund treats preferred securities as equity securities for federal income tax purposes and the closedend fund complies with certain requirements under the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” a fund’s investment in auction rate preferred securities of closedend funds is subject to limitations on investments in other us registered investment companies which limitations are prescribed under the  act except as permitted by rule or exemptive order see “investment company securities and exchangetraded funds” below for more information a fund is generally prohibited from acquiring more than  of the voting securities of any other such investment company and investing more than  of a fund’s total assets in securities of any one such investment company or more than  of its total assets in securities of all such investment companies a fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees paid by such closedend funds in addition to the advisory fee payable directly by the fund bank obligations bank obligations consist of bankers’ acceptances certificates of deposit bank notes and time deposits bankers’ acceptances are negotiable drafts or bills of exchange typically drawn by an importer or exporter to pay for specific merchandise which are “accepted” by a bank meaning in effect that the bank unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on maturity to be eligible for purchase by a fund a bankers’ acceptance must be guaranteed by a domestic or foreign bank or savings and loan association having at the time of investment total assets in excess of  billion as of the date of its most recently published financial statements   part ii   certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates issued against funds deposited in a commercial bank or a savings and loan association for a definite period of time and earning a specified return certificates of deposit may also include those issued by foreign banks outside the united states “us” with total assets at the time of purchase in excess of the equivalent of  billion such certificates of deposit include eurodollar and yankee certificates of deposit eurodollar certificates of deposit are us dollardenominated certificates of deposit issued by branches of foreign and domestic banks located outside the us yankee certificates of deposit are certificates of deposit issued by a us branch of a foreign bank denominated in us dollars and held in the us certain funds may also invest in obligations including bankers’ acceptances and certificates of deposit denominated in foreign currencies see “foreign investments including foreign currencies” herein with regard to certificates of deposit issued by us banks and savings and loan associations to be eligible for purchase by a fund a certificate of deposit must be issued by i a domestic or foreign branch of a us commercial bank which is a member of the federal reserve system or the deposits of which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or ii a domestic savings and loan association the deposits of which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation provided that in each case at the time of purchase such institution has total assets in excess of  billion as of the date of its most recently published financial statements time deposits are interestbearing nonnegotiable deposits at a bank or a savings and loan association that have a specific maturity date a time deposit earns a specific rate of interest over a definite period of time time deposits cannot be traded on the secondary market and those exceeding seven days and with a withdrawal penalty are considered to be illiquid time deposits will be maintained only at banks and savings and loan associations from which a fund could purchase certificates of deposit the funds will not invest in obligations for which a fund’s adviser or any of its affiliated persons is the ultimate obligor or accepting bank provided however that the funds maintain demand deposits at their affiliated custodian jpmorgan chase bank na “jpmorgan chase bank” subject to the funds’ limitations on concentration in a particular industry there is no limitation on the amount of a fund’s assets which may be invested in obligations of banks which meet the conditions set forth herein commercial paper commercial paper is defined as shortterm obligations generally with maturities from  to  days issued by banks or bank holding companies corporations and finance companies although commercial paper is generally unsecured the funds may also purchase secured commercial paper in the event of a default of an issuer of secured commercial paper a fund may hold the securities and other investments that were pledged as collateral even if it does not invest in such securities or investments in such a case the fund would take steps to dispose of such securities or investments in a commercially reasonable manner commercial paper includes master demand obligations see “variable and floating rate instruments” below certain funds may also invest in canadian commercial paper which is commercial paper issued by a canadian corporation or a canadian counterpart of a us corporation and in europaper which is us dollar denominated commercial paper of a foreign issuer see “risk factors of foreign investments” below convertible securities certain funds may invest in convertible securities convertible securities include any debt securities or preferred stock which may be converted into common stock or which carry the right to purchase common stock generally convertible securities entitle the holder to exchange the securities for a specified number of shares of common stock usually of the same company at specified prices within a certain period of time the terms of any convertible security determine its ranking in a company’s capital structure in the case of subordinated convertible debentures the holders’ claims on assets and earnings are subordinated to the claims of other creditors and are senior to the claims of preferred and common shareholders in the case of convertible preferred stock the holders’ claims on assets and earnings are subordinated to the claims of all creditors and are senior to the claims of common shareholders convertible securities have characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities due to the conversion feature the market value of convertible securities tends to move together with the market value of the underlying common stock as a result selection of convertible securities to a great extent is based on the potential for capital appreciation that may exist in the underlying stock the value of convertible securities is also affected by prevailing interest rates the credit quality of the issuer and any call provisions in some cases the issuer may cause a   part ii   convertible security to convert to common stock in other situations it may be advantageous for a fund to cause the conversion of convertible securities to common stock if a convertible security converts to common stock a fund may hold such common stock in its portfolio even if it does not ordinarily invest in common stock certain funds invest in contingent securities structured as contingent convertible securities also known as cocos contingent convertible securities are typically issued by nonus banks and are designed to behave like bonds in times of economic health yet absorb losses when a predetermined trigger event occurs a contingent convertible security is a hybrid debt security either convertible into equity at a predetermined share price or written down in value based on the specific terms of the individual security if a prespecified trigger event occurs the “trigger event” unlike traditional convertible securities the conversion of a contingent convertible security from debt to equity is “contingent” and will occur only in the case of a trigger event trigger events vary by instrument and are defined by the documents governing the contingent convertible security such trigger events may include a decline in the issuer’s capital below a specified threshold level increase in the issuer’s risk weighted assets the share price of the issuer falling to a particular level for a certain period of time and certain regulatory events contingent convertible securities are subject to the credit interest rate high yield security foreign security and markets risks associated with bonds and equities and to the risks specific to convertible securities in general contingent convertible securities are also subject to additional risks specific to their structure including conversion risk because trigger events are not consistently defined among contingent convertible securities this risk is greater for contingent convertible securities that are issued by banks with capital ratios close to the level specified in the trigger event in addition coupon payments on contingent convertible securities are discretionary and may be cancelled by the issuer at any point for any reason and for any length of time the discretionary cancellation of payments is not an event of default and there are no remedies to require reinstatement of coupon payments or payment of any past missed payments coupon payments may also be subject to approval by the issuer’s regulator and may be suspended in the event there are insufficient distributable reserves due to uncertainty surrounding coupon payments contingent convertible securities may be volatile and their price may decline rapidly in the event that coupon payments are suspended contingent convertible securities typically are structurally subordinated to traditional convertible bonds in the issuer’s capital structure in certain scenarios investors in contingent convertible securities may suffer a loss of capital ahead of equity holders or when equity holders do not contingent convertible securities are also subject to extension risk contingent convertible securities are perpetual instruments and may only be callable at predetermined dates upon approval of the applicable regulatory authority there is no guarantee that a fund will receive return of principal on contingent convertible securities convertible contingent securities are a newer form of instrument and the regulatory environment for these instruments continues to evolve because the market for contingent convertible securities is evolving it is uncertain how the larger market for contingent convertible securities would react to a trigger event or coupon suspension applicable to a single issuer the value of contingent convertible securities is unpredictable and will be influenced by many factors such as i the creditworthiness of the issuer andor fluctuations in such issuer’s applicable capital ratios ii supply and demand for contingent convertible securities iii general market conditions and available liquidity and iv economic financial and political events that affect the issuer its particular market or the financial markets in general custodial receipts certain funds may acquire securities in the form of custodial receipts that evidence ownership of future interest payments principal payments or both on certain us treasury notes or bonds in connection with programs sponsored by banks and brokerage firms these are not considered us government securities and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government these notes and bonds are held in custody by a bank on behalf of the owners of the receipts debt instruments below investment grade securities securities that were rated investment grade at the time of purchase may subsequently be rated below investment grade bb or lower by standard  poor’s corporation “sp” and bal or lower by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” certain funds that do not invest in below investment grade securities as a main investment strategy may nonetheless continue to hold such securities if the adviser believes it is   part ii   advantageous for the fund to do so the high degree of risk involved in these investments can result in substantial or total losses these securities are subject to greater risk of loss greater sensitivity to interest rate and economic changes valuation difficulties and a potential lack of a secondary or public market for securities the market price of these securities also can change suddenly and unexpectedly corporate debt securities corporate debt securities may include bonds and other debt securities of us and nonus issuers including obligations of industrial utility banking and other corporate issuers all debt securities are subject to the risk of an issuer’s inability to meet principal and interest payments on the obligation and may also be subject to price volatility due to such factors as market interest rates market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity high yieldhigh risk securitiesjunk bonds certain funds may invest in high yield securities to varying degrees high yield high risk bonds are securities that are generally rated below investment grade by the primary rating agencies bb or lower by sp and bal or lower by moody’s or unrated but determined by the fund’s adviser to be of comparable quality other terms used to describe such securities include “lower rated bonds” “noninvestment grade bonds” “below investment grade bonds” and “junk bonds” these securities are considered to be highrisk investments high yield securities are regarded as predominately speculative there is a greater risk that issuers of lower rated securities will default than issuers of higher rated securities issuers of lower rated securities generally are less creditworthy and may be highly indebted financially distressed or bankrupt these issuers are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes political changes or adverse industry developments in addition high yield securities are frequently subordinated to the prior payment of senior indebtedness if an issuer fails to pay principal or interest a fund would experience a decrease in income and a decline in the market value of its investments a fund may also incur additional expenses in seeking recovery from the issuer the income and market value of lower rated securities may fluctuate more than higher rated securities noninvestment grade securities are more sensitive to shortterm corporate economic and market developments during periods of economic uncertainty and change the market price of the investments in lower rated securities may be volatile the default rate for high yield bonds tends to be cyclical with defaults rising in periods of economic downturn it is often more difficult to value lower rated securities than higher rated securities if an issuer’s financial condition deteriorates accurate financial and business information may be limited or unavailable the lower rated investments may be thinly traded and there may be no established secondary market because of the lack of market pricing and current information for investments in lower rated securities valuation of such investments is much more dependent on the judgment of the adviser than is the case with higher rated securities in addition relatively few institutional purchasers may hold a major portion of an issue of lowerrated securities at times as a result a fund that invests in lower rated securities may be required to sell investments at substantial losses or retain them indefinitely even where an issuer’s financial condition is deteriorating credit quality of noninvestment grade securities can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security future legislation may have a possible negative impact on the market for high yield high risk bonds as an example in the late ’s legislation required federallyinsured savings and loan associations to divest their investments in high yield high risk bonds new legislation if enacted could have a material negative effect on a fund’s investments in lower rated securities inflationlinked debt securities inflationlinked securities include fixed and floating rate debt securities of varying maturities issued by the us government its agencies and instrumentalities such as treasury inflation protected securities “tips” as well as securities issued by other entities such as corporations municipalities foreign governments and foreign issuers including foreign issuers from emerging markets see also “foreign investments including foreign currencies” typically such securities are structured as fixed income investments whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation the following two structures are common i the us treasury and some other issuers issue inflationlinked securities that accrue inflation into the principal value of the security and ii other issuers may pay out the consumer price index “cpi” accruals as part of a semiannual coupon other types of inflationlinked securities exist which use an inflation index other than the cpi inflationlinked securities issued by the us treasury such as tips have maturities of approximately five ten or thirty years although it is possible that securities with other maturities will be issued in the future typically   part ii   tips pay interest on a semiannual basis equal to a fixed percentage of the inflationadjusted principal amount for example if a fund purchased an inflationindexed bond with a par value of  and a  real rate of return coupon payable  semiannually and the rate of inflation over the first six months was  the midyear par value of the bond would be  and the first semiannual interest payment would be   times  if inflation during the second half of the year resulted in the whole year’s inflation of  the endofyear par value of the bond would be  and the second semiannual interest payment would be   times  if the periodic adjustment rate measuring inflation falls the principal value of inflationindexed bonds will be adjusted downward and consequently the interest payable on these securities calculated with respect to a smaller principal amount will be reduced repayment of the original bond principal upon maturity as adjusted for inflation is guaranteed in the case of tips even during a period of deflation although the inflationadjusted principal received could be less than the inflationadjusted principal that had accrued to the bond at the time of purchase however the current market value of the bonds is not guaranteed and will fluctuate other inflationrelated bonds exist which may or may not provide a similar guarantee if a guarantee of principal is not provided the adjusted principal value of the bond repaid at maturity may be less than the original principal the value of inflationlinked securities is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates real interest rates in turn are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation therefore if the rate of inflation rises at a faster rate than nominal interest rates real interest rates might decline leading to an increase in value of inflationlinked securities while inflationlinked securities are expected to be protected from longterm inflationary trends shortterm increases in inflation may lead to a decline in value if interest rates rise due to reasons other than inflation for example due to changes in currency exchange rates investors in these securities may not be protected to the extent that the increase is not reflected in the bond’s inflation measure the periodic adjustment of us inflationlinked securities is tied to the consumer price index for all urban consumers “cpiu” which is not seasonably adjusted and which is calculated monthly by the us bureau of labor statistics the cpiu is a measurement of changes in the cost of living made up of components such as housing food transportation and energy inflationlinked securities issued by a foreign government are generally adjusted to reflect a comparable inflation index calculated by that government there can be no assurance that the cpiu or a foreign inflation index will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services moreover there can be no assurance that the rate of inflation in a foreign country will be correlated to the rate of inflation in the us any increase in the principal amount of an inflationlinked security will be considered taxable ordinary income even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity variable and floating rate instruments certain obligations purchased by the funds may carry variable or floating rates of interest may involve a conditional or unconditional demand feature and may include variable amount master demand notes variable and floating rate instruments are issued by a wide variety of issuers and may be issued for a wide variety of purposes including as a method of reconstructing cash flows subject to their investment objective policies and restrictions certain funds may acquire variable and floating rate instruments a variable rate instrument is one whose terms provide for the adjustment of its interest rate on set dates and which upon such adjustment can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its par value certain funds may purchase extendable commercial notes extendable commercial notes are variable rate notes which normally mature within a short period of time eg  month but which may be extended by the issuer for a maximum maturity of thirteen months a floating rate instrument is one whose terms provide for the adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified interest rate changes and which at any time can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its par value floating rate instruments are frequently not rated by credit rating agencies however unrated variable and floating rate instruments purchased by a fund will be determined by the fund’s adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase to rated instruments eligible for purchase under the fund’s investment policies in making such determinations a fund’s adviser will consider the earning power cash flow and other liquidity ratios of the issuers of such instruments such issuers include financial merchandising bank holding and other companies and will continuously monitor their financial condition there may be no active secondary market with respect to a particular variable or floating rate instrument purchased by a fund the absence of such an active secondary market could make it difficult for the fund to dispose of the variable or floating rate instrument involved in the event the issuer of the instrument defaulted on its payment obligations and the fund could for this or other   part ii   reasons suffer a loss to the extent of the default variable or floating rate instruments may be secured by bank letters of credit or other assets a fund may purchase a variable or floating rate instrument to facilitate portfolio liquidity or to permit investment of the fund’s assets at a favorable rate of return as a result of the floating and variable rate nature of these investments the funds’ yields may decline and they may forego the opportunity for capital appreciation during periods when interest rates decline however during periods when interest rates increase the funds’ yields may increase and they may have reduced risk of capital depreciation past periods of high inflation together with the fiscal measures adopted to attempt to deal with it have seen wide fluctuations in interest rates particularly “prime rates” charged by banks while the value of the underlying floating or variable rate securities may change with changes in interest rates generally the nature of the underlying floating or variable rate should minimize changes in value of the instruments accordingly as interest rates decrease or increase the potential for capital appreciation and the risk of potential capital depreciation is less than would be the case with a portfolio of fixed rate securities a fund’s portfolio may contain floating or variable rate securities on which stated minimum or maximum rates or maximum rates set by state law limit the degree to which interest on such floating or variable rate securities may fluctuate to the extent it does increases or decreases in value may be somewhat greater than would be the case without such limits because the adjustment of interest rates on the floating or variable rate securities is made in relation to movements of the applicable banks’ “prime rates” or other shortterm rate securities adjustment indices the floating or variable rate securities are not comparable to longterm fixed rate securities accordingly interest rates on the floating or variable rate securities may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed rate obligations of comparable quality with similar maturities variable amount master notes variable amount master notes are notes which may possess a demand feature that permit the indebtedness to vary and provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate according to the terms of the instrument variable amount master notes may not be secured by collateral to the extent that variable amount master notes are secured by collateral they are subject to the risks described under the section “loans—collateral and subordination risk” because master notes are direct lending arrangements between a fund and the issuer of the notes they are not normally traded although there is no secondary market in the notes a fund may demand payment of principal and accrued interest if the fund is not repaid such principal and accrued interest the fund may not be able to dispose of the notes due to the lack of a secondary market while master notes are not typically rated by credit rating agencies issuers of variable amount master notes which are normally manufacturing retail financial brokerage investment banking and other business concerns must satisfy the same criteria as those set forth with respect to commercial paper if any in part i of this sai under the heading “diversification” a fund’s adviser will consider the credit risk of the issuers of such notes including its earning power cash flow and other liquidity ratios of such issuers and will continuously monitor their financial status and ability to meet payment on demand in determining average weighted portfolio maturity a variable amount master note will be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period of time remaining until the principal amount can be recovered from the issuer variable rate instruments and money market funds variable or floating rate instruments with stated maturities of more than  days may under the sec’s rule applicable to money market funds rule a under the  act be deemed to have shorter maturities other than in connection with the calculation of dollarweighted average life to maturity of a portfolio as follows  adjustable rate government securities a government security which is a variable rate security where the variable rate of interest is readjusted no less frequently than every  days shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate a government security which is a floating rate security shall be deemed to have a remaining maturity of one day  shortterm variable rate securities a variable rate security the principal amount of which in accordance with the terms of the security must unconditionally be paid in  calendar days or less shall be deemed to have maturity equal to the earlier of the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand  longterm variable rate securities a variable rate security the principal amount of which is scheduled to be paid in more than  days that is subject to a demand feature shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the longer of the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand   part ii    shortterm floating rate securities a floating rate security the principal amount of which in accordance with the terms of the security must unconditionally be paid in  calendar days or less shall be deemed to have a maturity of one day  longterm floating rate securities a floating rate security the principal amount of which is scheduled to be paid in more than  days that is subject to a demand

holder is entitled to receive the par value of the security payinkind securities are securities that have interest payable by delivery of additional securities upon maturity the holder is entitled to receive the aggregate par value of the securities a fund accrues income with respect to zerocoupon and payinkind securities prior to the receipt of cash payments deferred payment securities are securities that remain zerocoupon securities until a predetermined date at which time the stated coupon rate becomes effective and interest becomes payable at regular intervals while interest payments are not made on such securities holders of such securities are deemed to have received “phantom income” because a fund will distribute “phantom income” to shareholders to the extent that shareholders elect to receive dividends in cash rather than reinvesting such dividends in additional shares the applicable fund will have fewer assets with which to purchase incomeproducing securities zerocoupon payinkind and deferred payment securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and lesser liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods impact of market conditions on the risks associated with debt securities investments in certain debt securities will be especially subject to the risk that during certain periods the liquidity of particular issuers or industries or all securities within a particular investment category may shrink or disappear suddenly and without warning as a result of adverse economic market or political events or adverse investor perceptions whether or not accurate current market conditions pose heightened risks for funds that invest in debt securities while the us is experiencing historically low interest rate levels signs of economic recovery and the end of the federal reserve board’s quantitative easing program have increased the risk that interest rates may rise in the near future any future interest rate increases or other adverse conditions eg inflationdeflation increased selling of certain fixedincome investments across other pooled investment vehicles or accounts changes in investor perception or changes in government intervention in the markets could cause the value of any fund that invests in debt securities to decrease as such debt securities markets may experience heightened levels of interest rate and liquidity risk as well as increased volatility if rising interest rates cause a fund to lose value the fund could also face increased shareholder redemptions which would further impair the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objectives the capacity for traditional dealers to engage in fixedincome trading for certain fixed income instruments has not kept pace with the growth of the fixed income market and in some cases has decreased as a result because dealers acting as market makers provide stability to a market the significant reduction in certain dealer inventories could potentially lead to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the fixed income markets such issues may be exacerbated during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility demand features certain funds may acquire securities that are subject to puts and standby commitments “demand features” to purchase the securities at their principal amount usually with accrued interest within a fixed period usually seven   part ii   days following a demand by the fund the demand feature may be issued by the issuer of the underlying securities a dealer in the securities or by another third party and may not be transferred separately from the underlying security the underlying securities subject to a put may be sold at any time at market rates applicable funds expect that they will acquire puts only where the puts are available without the payment of any direct or indirect consideration however if advisable or necessary a premium may be paid for put features a premium paid will have the effect of reducing the yield otherwise payable on the underlying security demand features provided by foreign banks involve certain risks associated with foreign investments see “foreign investments including foreign currencies” for more information on these risks under a “standby commitment” a dealer would agree to purchase at a fund’s option specified securities at a specified price a fund will acquire these commitments solely to facilitate portfolio liquidity and does not intend to exercise its rights thereunder for trading purposes standby commitments may also be referred to as put options the purpose of engaging in transactions involving puts is to maintain flexibility and liquidity to permit a fund to meet redemption requests and remain as fully invested as possible equity securities warrants and rights common stock common stock represents a share of ownership in a company and usually carries voting rights and may earn dividends unlike preferred stock common stock dividends are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of the issuer’s board of directors common stock occupies the most junior position in a company’s capital structure as with all equity securities the price of common stock fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition including those that result from management’s performance or changes to the business of the company and overall market and economic conditions common stock warrants and rights common stock warrants entitle the holder to buy common stock from the issuer of the warrant at a specific price the “strike price” for a specific period of time the market price of warrants may be substantially lower than the current market price of the underlying common stock yet warrants are subject to similar price fluctuations as a result warrants may be more volatile investments than the underlying common stock if a warrant is exercised a fund may hold common stock in its portfolio even if it does not ordinarily invest in common stock rights are similar to warrants but normally have a shorter duration and are typically distributed directly by the issuers to existing shareholders while warrants are typically attached to new debt or preferred stock issuances warrants and rights generally do not entitle the holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying common stock and do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer company warrants and rights will expire if not exercised on or prior to the expiration date preferred stock preferred stock is a class of stock that generally pays dividends at a specified rate and has preference over common stock in the payment of dividends and liquidation preferred stock generally does not carry voting rights as with all equity securities the price of preferred stock fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and on overall market and economic conditions because preferred stocks generally pay dividends only after the issuing company makes required payments to holders of its bonds and other debt the value of preferred stocks is more sensitive than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects initial public offerings “ipos” the funds may purchase securities in ipos these securities are subject to many of the same risks as investing in companies with smaller market capitalizations securities issued in ipos have no trading history and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods the prices of securities sold in ipos may be highly volatile at any particular time or from time to time a fund may not be able to invest in securities issued in ipos or invest to the extent desired because for example only a small portion if any of the securities being offered in an ipo may be made available to the fund in addition under certain market conditions a relatively small number of companies may issue securities in ipos similarly as the number of funds to which ipo securities are allocated increases the number of securities issued to any one fund may decrease the investment performance of a fund during periods when it is unable to invest significantly or at all in ipos may be lower than during periods when the fund is able to do so in addition as a fund increases in size the impact of ipos on the fund’s performance will generally decrease foreign investments including foreign currencies some of the funds may invest in certain obligations or securities of foreign issuers for purposes of a nonmoney market fund’s investment policies and unless described otherwise in a fund’s prospectus an issuer of a   part ii   security will be deemed to be located in a particular country if i the principal trading market for the security is in such country ii the issuer is organized under the laws of such country or iii the issuer derives at least  of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least  of its total assets situated in such country possible investments include equity securities and debt securities eg bonds and commercial paper of foreign entities obligations of foreign branches of us banks and of foreign banks including without limitation eurodollar certificates of deposit eurodollar time deposits eurodollar bankers’ acceptances canadian time deposits and yankee certificates of deposit and investments in canadian commercial paper and europaper securities of foreign issuers may include sponsored and unsponsored american depositary receipts “adrs” european depositary receipts “edrs” and global depositary receipts “gdrs” sponsored adrs are listed on the new york stock exchange unsponsored adrs are not therefore there may be less information available about the issuers of unsponsored adrs than the issuers of sponsored adrs unsponsored adrs are restricted securities edrs and gdrs are not listed on the new york stock exchange as a result it may be difficult to obtain information about edrs and gdrs the money market funds may only invest in us dollardenominated securities risk factors of foreign investments the following is a summary of certain risks associated with foreign investments political and exchange risks foreign investments may subject a fund to investment risks that differ in some respects from those related to investments in obligations of us domestic issuers such risks include potential future adverse political and economic developments sanctions or other measures by the united states or other governments possible imposition of withholding taxes on interest or other income possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of foreign deposits possible establishment of exchange controls or taxation at the source greater fluctuations in value due to changes in exchange rates or the adoption of other foreign governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment of principal and interest on such obligations higher transaction costs foreign investments may entail higher custodial fees and sales commissions than domestic investments accounting and regulatory differences foreign issuers of securities or obligations are often subject to accounting treatment and engage in business practices different from those of domestic issuers of similar securities or obligations in addition foreign issuers are usually not subject to the same degree of regulation as domestic issuers and their securities may trade on relatively small markets causing their securities to experience potentially higher volatility and more limited liquidity than securities of domestic issuers foreign branches of us banks and foreign banks are not regulated by us banking authorities and may be subject to less stringent reserve requirements than those applicable to domestic branches of us banks in addition foreign banks generally are not bound by accounting auditing and financial reporting standards comparable to those applicable to us banks dividends and interest paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may decrease the net return on foreign investments as compared to dividends and interest paid to a fund by domestic companies currency risk foreign securities may be denominated in foreign currencies although foreign issuers may also issue securities denominated in us dollars the value of a fund’s investments denominated in foreign currencies and any funds held in foreign currencies will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates the relative strength of those currencies and the us dollar and exchangecontrol regulations changes in the foreign currency exchange rates also may affect the value of dividends and interest earned gains and losses realized on the sale of securities and net investment income and gains if any to be distributed to shareholders by a fund the exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies are determined by the forces of supply and demand in foreign exchange markets and the relative merits of investments in different countries actual or anticipated changes in interest rates and other complex factors as seen from an international perspective currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency exchange rates also can be affected by intervention or lack of intervention by the united states or foreign governments or central banks or by currency controls or political developments in the united states or elsewhere accordingly the ability of a fund that invests in foreign securities as part of its principal investment strategy to achieve its investment objective may depend to a certain extent on exchange rate movements in addition while the volume of transactions effected on foreign stock exchanges has increased in recent years in most cases it remains appreciably below that of domestic securities exchanges accordingly a fund’s foreign investments may be less liquid and their prices may be more volatile than comparable investments in securities of us companies in buying and selling securities on foreign exchanges purchasers normally pay fixed commissions that are generally   part ii   higher than the negotiated commissions charged in the us in addition there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and issuers located in foreign countries than in the us settlement risk the settlement periods for foreign securities and instruments are often longer than those for securities or obligations of us issuers or instruments denominated in us dollars delayed settlement may affect the liquidity of a fund’s holdings certain types of securities and other instruments are not traded “delivery versus payment” in certain markets eg government bonds in russia meaning that a fund may deliver securities or instruments before payment is received from the counterparty in such markets the fund may not receive timely payment for securities or other instruments it has delivered and may be subject to increased risk that the counterparty will fail to make payments when due or default completely brady bonds brady bonds are securities created through the exchange of existing commercial bank loans to public and private entities in certain emerging markets for new bonds in connection with debt restructurings brady bonds have been issued since  in light of the history of defaults of countries issuing brady bonds on their commercial bank loans investments in brady bonds may be viewed as speculative and subject to the same risks as emerging market securities brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or uncollateralized are issued in various currencies but primarily the us dollar and are actively traded in overthecounter “otc” secondary markets incomplete collateralization of interest or principal payment obligations results in increased credit risk dollardenominated collateralized brady bonds which may be either fixedrate or floating rate bonds are generally collateralized by us treasury securities global depositary notes foreign securities and emerging markets securities include global depositary notes “gdns” a gdn is a debt instrument created by a bank that evidences ownership of local currencydenominated debt securities gdns reflect the terms of particular local currencydenominated bonds gdns trade settle and pay interest and principal in us dollars but typically are restricted securities that do not trade on an exchange any distributions paid to the holders of gdns are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary bank in addition to the risks associated with foreign investments a fund’s investments in gdns is subject to the risks associated with the underlying local currencydenominated bond and derivative instruments including credit risk default or similar event risk counterparty risk interest rate risk leverage risk liquidity risk and management risk holders of gdns may have limited rights and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of gdns because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert the bonds into gdns and vice versa such restrictions may cause bonds of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the gdn obligations of supranational entities obligations of supranational entities include securities designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development of international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for reconstruction and development the “world bank” the european coal and steel community the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank each supranational entity’s lending activities are limited to a percentage of its total capital including “callable capital” contributed by its governmental members at the entity’s call reserves and net income there is no assurance that participating governments will be able or willing to honor their commitments to make capital contributions to a supranational entity sukuk foreign securities and emerging market securities include sukuk sukuk are certificates similar to bonds issued by the issuer to obtain an upfront payment in exchange for an income stream to be generated by certain assets of the issuer generally the issuer sells the investor a certificate which the investor then rents back to the issuer for a predetermined rental fee the issuer also makes a contractual promise to buy back the certificate at a future date at par value while the certificate is linked to the returns generated by certain assets of the issuer the underlying assets are not pledged as security for the certificates and the fund as the investor is relying on the creditworthiness of the issuer for all payments required by the sukuk issuers of sukuk may include international financial institutions foreign governments and agencies of foreign governments underlying assets may include without limitation real estate developed and undeveloped lease contracts and machinery and equipment emerging market securities investing in companies domiciled in emerging market countries may be subject to potentially higher risks than investments in developed countries these risks include i less social political and economic stability ii greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities or low nonexistent trading volumes iii less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities of the foreign exchanges and brokerdealers iv the seizure or confiscation by local governments of securities held by foreign investors and the possible suspension or limiting by local governments of an issuer’s ability to make dividend or interest payments v limiting or entirely restricting repatriation of invested capital profits and dividends by local governments vi possible local taxation of capital gains including on a retroactive basis vii the attempt by issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments to make dividend or interest   part ii   payments to foreign investors in the local currency viii difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities andor local judges favoring the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors ix bankruptcy judgments being paid in the local currency x greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities due to limited public information regarding the issuer and xi difficulty of ascertaining the financial health of an issuer due to lax financial reporting on a regular basis substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards emerging country securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality the markets for securities in other emerging countries are in the earliest stages of their development and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging countries may not be able to absorb without price disruptions a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries the limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers for example prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets additionally market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets the limited liquidity of emerging country securities may also affect a fund’s ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be weak or nonexistent sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets certain emerging market countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property in many cases with little or no compensation and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future foreign investment in the securities markets of certain emerging countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees these restrictions may limit a fund’s investment in certain emerging countries and may increase the expenses of the fund certain emerging countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer’s outstanding securities or to a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms including price than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals many developing countries lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of the us political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth social unrest labor strikes civil wars and religious oppression economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of i high interest rates ii high levels of inflation including hyperinflation iii high levels of unemployment or underemployment iv changes in government economic and tax policies including confiscatory taxation and v imposition of trade barriers currencies of emerging market countries are subject to significantly greater risks than currencies of developed countries many emerging market countries have experienced steady declines or even sudden devaluations of their currencies relative to the us dollar some emerging market currencies may not be internationally traded or may be subject to strict controls by local governments resulting in undervalued or overvalued currencies some emerging market countries have experienced balance of payment deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves governments have responded by restricting currency conversions future restrictive exchange controls could prevent or restrict a company’s ability to make dividend or interest payments in the original currency of the obligation usually us dollars in addition even though the currencies of some emerging market countries may be convertible into us dollars the conversion rates may be artificial to their actual market values a fund’s income and in some cases capital gains from foreign stocks and securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the countries in which it invests and treaties between the us and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates foreign markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions such delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of a fund remains uninvested and no return is earned on such assets the inability of the fund to make intended security purchases or sales due to settlement problems could result either in losses to the fund due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio   part ii   securities in the fund deeming those securities to be illiquid or if the fund has entered into a contract to sell the securities in possible liability to the purchaser in the past governments within the emerging markets have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs which cause huge budget deficits often interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet representing a large percentage of total gross domestic product “gdp” these foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and have served as fuel for political parties of the opposition which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors but instead to use these funds for social programs either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan andor bond obligations have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted these events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in emerging market countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing but their ability to borrow in the future as well sovereign obligations sovereign debt includes investments in securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government or its agencies authorities or political subdivisions an investment in sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt obligations the issuer of the sovereign debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due and a fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default during periods of economic uncertainty the market prices of sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of us debt obligations in the past certain emerging markets have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations withheld payments of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts a sovereign debtor’s willingness or ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation the extent of its foreign currency reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange the relative size of the debt service burden the sovereign debtor’s policy toward principal international lenders and local political constraints sovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt the failure of a sovereign debtor to implement economic reforms achieve specified levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of thirdparty commitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor which may further impair such debtor’s ability or willingness to service its debts foreign currency transactions certain funds may engage in foreign currency transactions which include the following some of which also have been described elsewhere in this sai options on currencies currency futures options on such futures forward foreign currency transactions forward rate agreements and currency swaps caps and floors certain funds may engage in such transactions in both us and nonus markets to the extent a fund enters into such transactions in markets other than in the us the fund may be subject to certain currency settlement liquidity trading and other risks similar to those described above with respect to the fund’s investments in foreign securities including emerging markets securities certain funds may engage in such transactions to hedge against currency risks as a substitute for securities in which the fund invests to increase or decrease exposure to a foreign currency to shift exposure from one foreign currency to another for risk management purposes or to increase income or gain to the fund to the extent that a fund uses foreign currency transactions for hedging purposes the fund may hedge either specific transactions or portfolio positions while a fund’s use of hedging strategies is intended to reduce the volatility of the net asset value of fund shares the net asset value of the fund will fluctuate there can be no assurance that a fund’s hedging transactions will be effective furthermore a fund may only engage in hedging activities from time to time and may not necessarily be engaging in hedging activities when movements in currency exchange rates occur certain funds are authorized to deal in forward foreign exchange between currencies of the different countries in which the fund will invest and multinational currency units as a hedge against possible variations in the foreign exchange rate between these currencies this is accomplished through contractual agreements entered into in the interbank market to purchase or sell one specified currency for another currency at a specified future date up to one year and price at the time of the contract transaction hedging generally when a fund engages in transaction hedging it enters into foreign currency transactions with respect to specific receivables or payables of the fund generally arising in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities a fund may engage in transaction hedging when it desires to “lock in”   part ii   the us dollar price or a nonus dollar currency “reference currency” of a security it has agreed to purchase or sell or the us dollar equivalent of a dividend or interest payment in a foreign currency by transaction hedging a fund attempts to protect itself against a possible loss resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between the us dollar or other reference currency and the applicable foreign currency during the period between the date on which the security is purchased or sold or on which the dividend or interest payment is declared and the date on which such payments are made or received a fund may purchase or sell a foreign currency on a spot or cash basis at the prevailing spot rate in connection with the settlement of transactions in portfolio securities denominated in that foreign currency certain funds reserve the right to purchase and sell foreign currency futures contracts traded in the us and subject to regulation by the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” for transaction hedging purposes a fund may also purchase us exchangelisted call and put options on foreign currency futures contracts and on foreign currencies a put option on a futures contract gives a fund the right to assume a short position in the foreign currency futures contract until expiration of the option a put option on currency gives a fund the right to sell a currency at an exercise price until the expiration of the option a call option on a futures contract gives a fund the right to assume a long position in the futures contract until the expiration of the option a call option on currency gives a fund the right to purchase a currency at the exercise price until the expiration of the option position hedging when engaging in position hedging a fund will enter into foreign currency exchange transactions to protect against a decline in the values of the foreign currencies in which their portfolio securities are denominated or an increase in the value of currency for securities which a fund’s adviser expects to purchase in connection with the position hedging the fund may purchase or sell foreign currency forward contracts or foreign currency on a spot basis a fund may purchase us exchangelisted put or call options on foreign currency and foreign currency futures contracts and buy or sell foreign currency futures contracts traded in the us and subject to regulation by the cftc the precise matching of the amounts of foreign currency exchange transactions and the value of the portfolio securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of such securities in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements in the value of those securities between the dates the currency exchange transactions are entered into and the dates they mature forward foreign currency exchange contracts certain funds may purchase forward foreign currency exchange contracts sometimes referred to as “currency forwards” “forward contracts” which involve an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract as agreed by the parties in an amount and at a price set at the time of the contract in the case of a cancelable forward contract the holder has the unilateral right to cancel the contract at maturity by paying a specified fee the contracts are traded in the interbank market conducted directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers so no intermediary is required a forward contract generally has no deposit requirement and no commissions are charged at any stage for trades at the maturity of a forward contract a fund may either accept or make delivery of the currency specified in the contract or at or prior to maturity enter into a closing transaction involving the purchase or sale of an offsetting contract closing transactions with respect to forward contracts are usually effected with the currency trader who is a party to the original forward contract for forward foreign currency contracts other than nondeliverable forwards that require physical settlement the funds will segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the current notional value of each contract in calculating the notional value the funds may net long and short contracts with the same currency and the same settlement date with respect to trades that do not settle through cls bank international the funds may only net long and short contracts if the contracts are with the same counterparty certain funds may also engage in nondeliverable forwards which are cash settled and which do not involve delivery of the currency specified in the contract for more information on nondeliverable forwards see “nondeliverable forwards” below foreign currency futures contracts certain funds may purchase foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency futures contracts traded in the us are designed by and traded on exchanges regulated by the cftc such as the new york mercantile exchange a fund may enter into foreign currency futures contracts for hedging purposes and other risk management purposes as defined in cftc regulations certain funds may also enter into foreign currency futures transactions to increase exposure to a foreign currency to shift exposure from one foreign currency to another or to increase income or gain to the fund   part ii   at the maturity of a futures contract the fund may either accept or make delivery of the currency specified in the contract or at or prior to maturity enter into a closing transaction involving the purchase or sale of an offsetting contract closing transactions with respect to futures contracts are effected on a commodities exchange a clearing corporation associated with the exchange assumes responsibility for closing out such contracts positions in the foreign currency futures contracts may be closed out only on an exchange or board of trade which provides a secondary market in such contracts there is no assurance that a secondary market on an exchange or board of trade will exist for any particular contract or at any particular time in such event it may not be possible to close a futures position in the event of adverse price movements the fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin for more information on futures contracts see “futures contracts” under the heading “options and futures transactions” below foreign currency options certain funds may purchase and sell us exchangelisted and over the counter call and put options on foreign currencies such options on foreign currencies operate similarly to options on securities when a fund purchases a put option the fund has the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a preagreed exchange rate on a specified date when a fund sells or writes a call option the fund has the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a preagreed exchange rate if the buyer exercises option some of the funds may also purchase and sell nondeliverable currency options “nondeliverable options” nondeliverable options are cashsettled options on foreign currencies each a “option reference currency” that are nonconvertible and that may be thinly traded or illiquid nondeliverable options involve an obligation to pay an amount in a deliverable currency such as us dollars euros japanese yen or british pounds sterling equal to the difference between the prevailing market exchange rate for the option reference currency and the agreed upon exchange rate the “nondeliverable option rate” with respect to an agreed notional amount options on foreign currencies are affected by all of those factors which influence foreign exchange rates and investments generally a fund is authorized to purchase or sell listed foreign currency options and currency swap contracts as a short or long hedge against possible variations in foreign exchange rates as a substitute for securities in which a fund may invest and for risk management purposes such transactions may be effected with respect to hedges on nonus dollar denominated securities including securities denominated in the euro owned by the fund sold by the fund but not yet delivered committed or anticipated to be purchased by the fund or in transaction or crosshedging strategies as an illustration a fund may use such techniques to hedge the stated value in us dollars of an investment in a japanese yendominated security in such circumstances the fund may purchase a foreign currency put option enabling it to sell a specified amount of yen for dollars at a specified price by a future date to the extent the hedge is successful a loss in the value of the dollar relative to the yen will tend to be offset by an increase in the value of the put option to offset in whole or in part the cost of acquiring such a put option the fund also may sell a call option which if exercised requires it to sell a specified amount of yen for dollars at a specified price by a future date a technique called a “collar” by selling the call option in this illustration the fund gives up the opportunity to profit without limit from increases in the relative value of the yen to the dollar certain funds may also enter into foreign currency futures transactions for nonhedging purposes including to increase or decrease exposure to a foreign currency to shift exposure from one foreign currency to another or to increase income or gain to the fund certain differences exist among these foreign currency instruments foreign currency options provide the holder thereof the right to buy or to sell a currency at a fixed price on a future date listed options are thirdparty contracts ie performance of the parties’ obligations is guaranteed by an exchange or clearing corporation which are issued by a clearing corporation traded on an exchange and have standardized strike prices and expiration dates otc options are twoparty contracts and have negotiated strike prices and expiration dates options on futures contracts are traded on boards of trade or futures exchanges currency swap contracts are negotiated twoparty agreements entered into in the interbank market whereby the parties exchange two foreign currencies at the inception of the contract and agree to reverse the exchange at a specified future time and at a specified exchange rate the jpmorgan emerging markets debt fund may also purchase and sell barrier“touch” options “barrier options” including knockin options “knockin options” and knockout options “knockout options” a barrier option is a type of exotic option that gives an investor a payout once the price of the underlying currency reaches or surpasses or falls below a predetermined barrier this type of option allows the buyer of the option to set the position of the barrier the length of time until expiration and the payout to be received once the barrier is broken there are two kinds of knockin options i “up and in” and ii “down and in” with knockin options if the buyer has selected an upper price barrier and the currency hits that level the knockin option turns into a more traditional option “vanilla option” whereby the owner has the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a preagreed exchange rate on a specified date this type of   part ii   knockin option is called “up and in” the “down and in” knockin option is the same as the “up and in” except the currency has to reach a lower barrier upon hitting the chosen lower price level the “down and in” knockin option turns into a vanilla option as in the knockin option there are two kinds of knockout options  i “up and out” and ii “down and out” however in a knockout option the buyer begins with a vanilla option and if the predetermined price barrier is hit the vanilla option is cancelled and the seller has no further obligation if the option hits the upper barrier the option is cancelled and the investor loses the premium paid thus “up and out” if the option hits the lower price barrier the option is cancelled thus “down and out” barrier options usually call for delivery of the underlying currency the value of a foreign currency option is dependent upon the value of the foreign currency and the us dollar and may have no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security because foreign currency transactions occurring in the interbank market involve substantially larger amounts than those that may be involved in the use of foreign currency options investors may be disadvantaged by having to deal in an odd lot market generally consisting of transactions of less than  million for the underlying foreign currencies at prices that are less favorable than those for round lots there is no systematic reporting of last sale information for foreign currencies and there is no regulatory requirement that quotations available through dealer or other market sources be firm or revised on a timely basis available quotation information is generally representative of very large transactions in the interbank market and thus may not reflect relatively smaller transactions less than  million where rates may be less favorable the interbank market in foreign currencies is a global aroundtheclock market to the extent that the us options markets are closed while the markets for the underlying currencies remain open significant price and rate movements may take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options market in addition to writing call options on currencies when a fund owns the underlying currency the funds may also write call options on currencies even if they do not own the underlying currency as long as the fund segregates cash or liquid assets that when added to the amounts deposited with a futures commission merchant or a broker as margin equal the market value of the currency underlying the call option but not less than the strike price of the call option the funds may also cover a written call option by owning a separate call option permitting the fund to purchase the reference currency at a price no higher than the strike price of the call option sold by the fund in addition a fund may write a nondeliverable call option if the fund segregates an amount equal to the current notional value amount obligated to pay netting is generally permitted of long and short positions of a specific country assuming long and short contracts are similar if there are securities or currency held in that specific country at least equal to the current notional value of the net currency positions no segregation is required nondeliverable forwards some of the funds may also invest in nondeliverable forwards “ndfs” ndfs are cashsettled shortterm forward contracts on foreign currencies each a “reference currency” that are nonconvertible and that may be thinly traded or illiquid ndfs involve an obligation to pay an amount the “settlement amount” equal to the difference between the prevailing market exchange rate for the reference currency and the agreed upon exchange rate the “ndf rate” with respect to an agreed notional amount ndfs have a fixing date and a settlement delivery date the fixing date is the date and time at which the difference between the prevailing market exchange rate and the agreed upon exchange rate is calculated the settlement delivery date is the date by which the payment of the settlement amount is due to the party receiving payment although ndfs are similar to forward foreign currency exchange contracts ndfs do not require physical delivery of the reference currency on the settlement date rather on the settlement date the only transfer between the counterparties is the monetary settlement amount representing the difference between the ndf rate and the prevailing market exchange rate ndfs typically may have terms from one month up to two years and are settled in us dollars ndfs are subject to many of the risks associated with derivatives in general and forward currency transactions including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency and the risk that the counterparty will fail to fulfill its obligations the funds will segregate or earmark liquid assets in an amount equal to the marked to market value on a daily basis of the ndf in calculating the marktomarket value the funds may net opposing ndf contracts with the same currency and the same settlement date with respect to trades that do not settle through cls bank international the funds may only net opposing ndf contracts if the contracts are with the same counterparty the funds will typically use ndfs for hedging purposes but may also use such instruments to increase income or gain the use of ndfs for hedging or to increase income or gain may not be successful resulting in losses to the fund and the cost of such strategies may reduce the funds’ respective returns foreign currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for currency conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the “spread” between prices at which they are buying and selling   part ii   various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to a fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer other foreign currency hedging strategies new options and futures contracts and other financial products and various combinations thereof continue to be developed and certain funds may invest in any such options contracts and products as may be developed to the extent consistent with the fund’s investment objective and the regulatory requirements applicable to investment companies and subject to the supervision of the trust’s board of trustees risk factors in foreign currency transactions the following is a summary of certain risks associated with foreign currency transactions imperfect correlation foreign currency transactions present certain risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in hedging strategies and price movements in a security being hedged creates the possibility that losses on the hedging transaction may be greater than gains in the value of a fund’s securities liquidity hedging instruments may not be liquid in all circumstances as a result in volatile markets the funds may not be able to dispose of or offset a transaction without incurring losses although foreign currency transactions used for hedging purposes may reduce the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged security at the same time the use of these instruments could tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in the value of such security leverage and volatility risk derivative instruments including foreign currency derivatives may sometimes increase or leverage a fund’s exposure to a particular market risk leverage enhances the price volatility of derivative instruments held by a fund strategy risk certain funds may use foreign currency derivatives for hedging as well as nonhedging purposes including to gain or adjust exposure to currencies and securities markets or to increase income or gain to a fund there is no guarantee that these strategies will succeed and their use may subject a fund to greater volatility and loss foreign currency transactions involve complex securities transactions that involve risks in addition to direct investments in securities including leverage risk and the risks associated with derivatives in general currencies and investments in foreign and emerging markets judgment of the adviser successful use of foreign currency transactions by a fund depends upon the ability of the applicable adviser to predict correctly movements in the direction of interest and currency rates and other factors affecting markets for securities if the expectations of the applicable adviser are not met a fund would be in a worse position than if a foreign currency transaction had not been pursued for example if a fund has hedged against the possibility of an increase in interest rates which would adversely affect the price of securities in its portfolio and the price of such securities increases instead the fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of its securities because it will have offsetting losses in its hedging positions in addition when utilizing instruments that require variation margin payments if the fund has insufficient cash to meet daily variation margin requirements it may have to sell securities to meet such requirements other risks such sales of securities may but will not necessarily be at increased prices which reflect the rising market thus a fund may have to sell securities at a time when it is disadvantageous to do so it is impossible to forecast with precision the market value of portfolio securities at the expiration or maturity of a forward contract or futures contract accordingly a fund may have to purchase additional foreign currency on the spot market and bear the expense of such purchase if the market value of the security or securities being hedged is less than the amount of foreign currency a fund is obligated to deliver and if a decision is made to sell the security or securities and make delivery of the foreign currency conversely it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the portfolio security or securities if the market value of such security or securities exceeds the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver transaction and position hedging do not eliminate fluctuations in the underlying prices of the securities which a fund owns or expects to purchase or sell rather an adviser may employ these techniques in an effort to maintain an investment portfolio that is relatively neutral to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to major foreign currencies and establish a rate of exchange which one can achieve at some future point in time additionally although these techniques tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged currency they also tend to limit any potential gain which might result from the increase in the value of such currency moreover it may not be possible for a fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the anticipated devaluation level   part ii   insurancelinked securities the jpmorgan strategic income opportunities fund jpmorgan total return fund jpmorgan tax aware income opportunities fund and jpmorgan multimanager alternatives fund may invest in debt instruments or equity securities structured as eventdriven eventlinked or insurancelinked notes or catastrophe bonds collectively “catastrophe bonds” and related instruments such as reinsurance sidecars collectively with catastrophe bonds “insurancelinked securities” these insurancelinked securities are generally debt obligations or equity securities for which the return of principal and the payment of interest or dividends typically are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specific “trigger” events that lead to economic andor human loss such as a hurricane of a specific category earthquake of a particular magnitude or other physical or weatherrelated phenomena for some insurancelinked securities the magnitude of the effect of the trigger event on the security may be based on losses to a company or industry modeled losses to a notional portfolio industry indexes readings of scientific instruments or certain other parameters associated with a catastrophe rather than actual losses if a trigger event as defined within the terms of each insurancelinked security occurs a fund may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest dividends andor principal invested in such insurancelinked security in addition if there is a dispute regarding a trigger event there may be delays in the payment of principal interest and dividends a fund is entitled to receive principal interest and dividends payments so long as no trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the insurancelinked security insurancelinked securities may be sponsored by government agencies insurance companies or reinsurers and issued by special purpose corporations or other offshore or onshore entities such special purpose entities are created to accomplish a narrow and welldefined objective such as the issuance of a note in connection with a specific reinsurance transaction typically insurancelinked securities are issued by offshore entities including entities in emerging markets and may be nondollar denominated as a result the funds will be subject to currency and foreign and emerging markets risk including the risks described in foreign investments often catastrophe bonds provide for extensions of maturity that are mandatory or optional at the discretion of the issuer or sponsor in order to process and audit loss claims in those cases where a trigger event has or possibly has occurred an extension of maturity may increase volatility in addition to the specified trigger events insurancelinked securities also may expose a fund to certain unanticipated risks including but not limited to issuer risk credit risk counterparty risk adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences additionally insurancelinked securities are subject to the risk that modeling used to calculate the probability of a trigger event may not be accurate andor underestimate the likelihood of a trigger event this may result in more frequent and greater than expected losses including loss of principal andor interest with respect to catastrophic bonds and dividends with respect to reinsurance sidecars insurancelinked securities are relatively new types of financial instruments as such there is no significant trading history of these securities and there can be no assurance that markets for these instruments will be liquid at all times lack of a liquid market may impose the risk of higher transaction costs and the possibility that a fund may be forced to liquidate positions when it would not be advantageous to do so insurancelinked securities are generally rated below investment grade or the unrated equivalent and have the same or similar risks as high yield debt securities also known as junk bonds including the risks described under high yieldhigh risk securitiesjunk bonds and are subject to the risk that the fund may lose some or all of its investment if the particular trigger identified under the insurancelinked security occurs insurancelinked securities typically are restricted to qualified institutional buyers and therefore are not subject to registration with the securities and exchange commission “sec” or any state securities commission generally are not listed on any national securities exchange the amount of public information available with respect to insurancelinked securities is generally less extensive than that which is available for exchange listed securities there can be no assurance that future regulatory determinations will not adversely affect the overall market for insurancelinked securities industry loss warranties are a type of insurancelinked securities that are designed to protect insurers or reinsurers from severe losses due to significant catastrophic events the buyer pays the seller a premium at the inception of the contract and in return the buyer can make a claim if losses due to a certain class of catastrophic event for example florida hurricanes as estimated by a thirdparty exceed an agreed trigger level industry loss warranties have standard terms and conditions and are collateralized these contracts are evaluated using detailed underwriting information on the applicable exposures provided by the reinsurers or their intermediaries   part ii   inverse floaters and interest rate caps inverse floaters are instruments whose interest rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or the value of an index the market value of an inverse floater will vary inversely with changes in market interest rates and will be more volatile in response to interest rate changes than that of a fixed rate obligation interest rate caps are financial instruments under which payments occur if an interest rate index exceeds a certain predetermined interest rate level known as the cap rate which is tied to a specific index these financial products will be more volatile in price than securities which do not include such a structure investment company securities and exchangetraded funds investment company securities a fund may acquire the securities of other investment companies “acquired funds” to the extent permitted under the  act and consistent with its investment objective and strategies as a shareholder of another investment company a fund would bear along with other shareholders its pro rata portion of the other investment company’s expenses including advisory fees these expenses would be in addition to the advisory and other expenses that a fund bears directly in connection with its own operations except as described below the  act currently requires that as determined immediately after a purchase is made i not more than  of the value of a fund’s total assets will be invested in the securities of any one investment company ii not more than  of the value of its total assets will be invested in the aggregate in securities of investment companies as a group and iii not more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any one investment company will be owned by a fund in addition section  of the  act prohibits a fund from investing in another jp morgan fund except as permitted by section  of the  act by rule or by exemptive order the limitations described above do not apply to investments in money market funds subject to certain conditions all of the jp morgan funds may invest in affiliated and unaffiliated money market funds without limit under rule d under the  act subject to the acquiring fund’s investment policies and restrictions and the conditions of the rule in addition the  act’s limits and restrictions summarized above do not apply to jp morgan funds that invest in other jp morgan funds in reliance on section dg of the  act sec rule or an exemptive order issued by the sec each a “fund of funds” collectively “funds of funds” such funds of funds include jpmorgan investor funds the “investor funds” the jpmorgan smartretirement funds and the jpmorgan smartretirement blend funds collectively the “jpmorgan smartretirement funds” jpmorgan smartallocation funds jpmorgan diversified real return fund jpmorgan access funds jpmorgan diversified fund and such other jp morgan funds that invest in other jp morgan funds in reliance on section dg of the  act or the rules issued section  section dg of the  act permits a fund to invest in acquired funds in the “same group of investment companies” “affiliated funds” government securities and shortterm paper in addition to the investments permitted by section dg rule d permits funds of funds to make investments in addition to affiliated funds under certain circumstances including  unaffiliated investment companies subject to certain limits  other types of securities such as stocks bonds and other securities not issued by an investment company that are consistent with the fund of fund’s investment policies and  affiliated and unaffiliated money market funds in order to be an eligible investment under section dg an affiliated fund must have a policy prohibiting it from investing in other funds under section df or g of the  act in addition to investments permitted by section dg and rule d the jp morgan funds may invest in derivatives pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the sec under the exemptive order the funds of funds are permitted to invest in financial instruments that may not be considered “securities” for purposes of rule d subject to certain conditions including a finding of the board of trustees that the advisory fees charged by the adviser to the funds of funds are for services that are in addition to and not duplicative of the advisory services provided to an underlying fund exchange traded funds “etfs” etfs are pooled investment vehicles whose ownership interests are purchased and sold on a securities exchange etfs may be structured investment companies depositary receipts or other pooled investment vehicles as shareholders of an etf the funds will bear their pro rata portion of any fees and expenses of the etfs although shares of etfs are traded on an exchange shares of certain etfs may not be redeemable by the etf in addition etfs may trade at a price below their net asset value also known as a discount   part ii   certain funds may use etfs to gain exposure to various asset classes and markets or types of strategies and investments by way of example etfs may be structured as broad based etfs that invest in a broad group of stocks from different industries and market sectors select sector or market etfs that invest in debt securities from a select sector of the economy a single industry or related industries or etfs that invest in foreign and emerging markets securities other types of etfs continue to be developed and the fund may invest in them to the extent consistent with such funds’ investment objectives policies and restrictions the etfs in which the funds invest are subject to the risks applicable to the types of securities and investments used by the etfs eg debt securities are subject to risks like credit and interest rate risks emerging markets securities are subject risks like currency risks and foreign and emerging markets risk derivatives are subject to leverage and counterparty risk etfs may be actively managed or indexbased actively managed etfs are subject to management risk and may not achieve their objective if the etf’s manager’s expectations regarding particular securities or markets are not met generally an index based etf’s objective is to track the performance of a specified index index based etfs may invest in a securities portfolio that includes substantially all of the securities in substantially the same amount as the securities included in the designated index or a representative sample because passively managed etfs are designed to track an index securities may be purchased retained and sold at times when an actively managed etf would not do so as a result shareholders of a fund that invest in such an etf can expect greater risk of loss and a correspondingly greater prospect of gain from changes in the value of securities that are heavily weighted in the index than would be the case if etf were not fully invested in such securities this risk is increased if a few component securities represent a highly concentrated weighting in the designated index unless permitted by the  act or an order or rule issued by the sec see “investment company securities” above for more information the fund’s investments in unaffiliated etfs that are structured as investment companies as defined in the  act are subject to certain percentage limitations of the  act regarding investments in other investment companies as a general matter these percentage limitations currently require a fund to limit its investments in any one issue of etfs to  of the fund’s total assets and  of the outstanding voting securities of the etf issue moreover a fund’s investments in all etfs may not currently exceed  of the fund’s total assets under the  act when aggregated with all other investments in investment companies etfs that are not structured as investment companies as defined in the  act are not subject to these percentage limitations sec exemptive orders granted to various etfs and their investment advisers permit the funds to invest beyond the  act limits subject to certain terms and conditions including a finding of the board of trustees that the advisory fees charged by the adviser to the fund are for services that are in addition to and not duplicative of the advisory services provided to those etfs loans some of the funds may invest in fixed and floating rate loans “loans” loans may include senior floating rate loans “senior loans” and secured and unsecured loans second lien or more junior loans “junior loans” and bridge loans or bridge facilities “bridge loans” loans are typically arranged through private negotiations between borrowers in the us or in foreign or emerging markets which may be corporate issuers or issuers of sovereign debt obligations “obligors” and one or more financial institutions and other lenders “lenders” generally the funds invest in loans by purchasing assignments of all or a portion of loans “assignments” or loan participations “participations” from third parties a fund has direct rights against the obligor on the loan when it purchases an assignment because assignments are arranged through private negotiations between potential assignees and potential assignors however the rights and obligations acquired by a fund as the purchaser of an assignment may differ from and be more limited than those held by the assigning lender with respect to participations typically a fund will have a contractual relationship only with the lender and not with the obligor the agreement governing participations may limit the rights of a fund to vote on certain changes which may be made to the loan agreement such as waiving a breach of a covenant however the holder of a participation will generally have the right to vote on certain fundamental issues such as changes in principal amount payment dates and interest rate participations may entail certain risks relating to the creditworthiness of the parties from which the participations are obtained a loan is typically originated negotiated and structured by a us or foreign commercial bank insurance company finance company or other financial institution the “agent” for a group of loan investors the agent typically administers and enforces the loan on behalf of the other loan investors in the syndicate the agent’s duties may include responsibility for the collection of principal and interest payments from the obligor and the   part ii   apportionment of these payments to the credit of all loan investors the agent is also typically responsible for monitoring compliance with the covenants contained in the loan agreement based upon reports prepared by the obligor in addition an institution typically but not always the agent holds any collateral on behalf of the loan investors in the event of a default by the obligor it is possible though unlikely that the fund could receive a portion of the borrower’s collateral if the fund receives collateral other than cash any proceeds received from liquidation of such collateral will be available for investment as part of the fund’s portfolio in the process of buying selling and holding loans a fund may receive andor pay certain fees these fees are in addition to interest payments received and may include facility fees commitment fees commissions and prepayment penalty fees when a fund buys or sells a loan it may pay a fee in certain circumstances a fund may receive a prepayment penalty fee upon prepayment of a loan additional information concerning senior loans senior loans typically hold the most senior position in the capital structure of the obligor are typically secured with specific collateral and have a claim on the assets andor stock of the obligor that is senior to that held by subordinated debtholders and shareholders of the obligor collateral for senior loans may include i working capital assets such as accounts receivable and inventory ii tangible fixed assets such as real property buildings and equipment iii intangible assets such as trademarks and patent rights andor iv security interests in shares of stock of subsidiaries or affiliates additional information concerning junior loans junior loans include secured and unsecured loans including subordinated loans second lien and more junior loans and bridge loans second lien and more junior loans “junior lien loans” are generally second or further in line in terms of repayment priority in addition junior lien loans may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or other more senior liens or may be secured by a separate set of assets junior loans generally give investors priority over general unsecured creditors in the event of an asset sale additional information concerning bridge loans bridge loans are shortterm loan arrangements eg  to  months typically made by an obligor in anticipation of intermediateterm or longterm permanent financing most bridge loans are structured as floatingrate debt with stepup provisions under which the interest rate on the bridge loan rises the longer the loan remains outstanding in addition bridge loans commonly contain a conversion feature that allows the bridge loan investor to convert its loan interest to senior exchange notes if the loan has not been prepaid in full on or prior to its maturity date bridge loans typically are structured as senior loans but may be structured as junior loans additional information concerning unfunded commitments unfunded commitments are contractual obligations pursuant to which the fund agrees to invest in a loan at a future date typically the fund receives a commitment fee for entering into the unfunded commitment additional information concerning synthetic letters of credit loans include synthetic letters of credit in a synthetic letter of credit transaction the lender typically creates a special purpose entity or a creditlinked deposit account for the purpose of funding a letter of credit to the borrower when a fund invests in a synthetic letter of credit the fund is typically paid a rate based on the lender’s borrowing costs and the terms of the synthetic letter of credit synthetic letters of credit are typically structured as assignments with the fund acquiring direct rights against the obligor additional information concerning loan originations in addition to investing in loan assignments and participations the strategic income opportunities fund may originate loans in which the fund would lend money directly to a borrower by investing in limited liability companies or corporations that make loans directly to borrowers the terms of the loans are negotiated with borrowers in private transactions such loans would be collateralized typically with tangible fixed assets such as real property or interests in real property such loans may also include mezzanine loans unlike loans secured by a mortgage on real property mezzanine loans are collateralized by an equity interest in a special purpose vehicle that owns the real property limitations on investments in loan assignments and participations if a government entity is a borrower on a loan the fund will consider the government to be the issuer of an assignment or participation for purposes of a fund’s fundamental investment policy that it will not invest  or more of its total assets in securities of issuers conducting their principal business activities in the same industry ie foreign government limited federal securities law protections certain loans may not be considered securities under the federal securities laws in such circumstances fewer legal protections may be available with respect to a fund’s investment in those loans in particular if a loan is not considered a security under the federal securities laws certain legal protections normally available to investors under the federal securities laws such as those against fraud and misrepresentation may not be available   part ii   risk factors of loans loans are subject to the risks associated with debt obligations in general including interest rate risk credit risk and market risk when a loan is acquired from a lender the risk includes the credit risk associated with the obligor of the underlying loan the fund may incur additional credit risk when the fund acquires a participation in a loan from another lender because the fund must assume the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the other lender from which the loan was acquired to the extent that loans involve obligors in foreign or emerging markets such loans are subject to the risks associated with foreign investments or investments in emerging markets in general the following outlines some of the additional risks associated with loans high yield securities risk the loans that a fund invests in may not be rated by an nrsro will not be registered with the sec or any state securities commission and will not be listed on any national securities exchange to the extent that such high yield loans are rated they typically will be rated below investment grade and are subject to an increased risk of default in the payment of principal and interest as well as the other risks described under “high yieldhigh risk securitiesjunk bonds” loans are vulnerable to market sentiment such that economic conditions or other events may reduce the demand for loans and cause their value to decline rapidly and unpredictably liquidity risk although the funds limit their investments in illiquid securities to no more than  of a fund’s net assets  of the total assets for the money market funds at the time of purchase loans that are deemed to be liquid at the time of purchase may become illiquid or less liquid no active trading market may exist for certain loans and certain loans may be subject to restrictions on resale or have a limited secondary market certain loans may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the inability to dispose of certain loans in a timely fashion or at a favorable price could result in losses to a fund also to the extent that a fund needs to satisfy redemption requests or cover unanticipated cash shortfalls the fund may seek to engage in borrowing under a credit facility or enter into lending agreements under which the fund would borrow money for temporary purposes directly from another jp morgan fund please see “interfund lending” certain money market funds also use an interest bearing deposit facility to set aside cash at a level estimated to meet the money market fund’s next business day’s intraday redemption orders see “interest bearing deposit facility” for more information collateral and subordination risk with respect to loans that are secured a fund is subject to the risk that collateral securing the loan will decline in value or have no value or that the fund’s lien is or will become junior in payment to other liens a decline in value of the collateral whether as a result of market value declines bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise could cause the loan to be under collateralized or unsecured in such event the fund may have the ability to require that the obligor pledge additional collateral the fund however is subject to the risk that the obligor may not pledge such additional collateral or a sufficient amount of collateral in some cases there may be no formal requirement for the obligor to pledge additional collateral in addition collateral may consist of assets that may not be readily liquidated and there is no assurance that the liquidation of such assets would satisfy an obligor’s obligation on a loan if the fund were unable to obtain sufficient proceeds upon a liquidation of such assets this could negatively affect fund performance if an obligor becomes involved in bankruptcy proceedings a court may restrict the ability of the fund to demand immediate repayment of the loan by obligor or otherwise liquidate the collateral a court may also invalidate the loan or the fund’s security interest in collateral or subordinate the fund’s rights under a senior loan or junior loan to the interest of the obligor’s other creditors including unsecured creditors or cause interest or principal previously paid to be refunded to the obligor if a court required interest or principal to be refunded it could negatively affect fund performance such action by a court could be based for example on a “fraudulent conveyance” claim to the effect that the obligor did not receive fair consideration for granting the security interest in the loan collateral to a fund for senior loans made in connection with a highly leveraged transaction consideration for granting a security interest may be deemed inadequate if the proceeds of the loan were not received or retained by the obligor but were instead paid to other persons such as shareholders of the obligor in an amount which left the obligor insolvent or without sufficient working capital there are also other events such as the failure to perfect a security interest due to faulty documentation or faulty official filings which could lead to the invalidation of a fund’s security interest in loan collateral if the fund’s security interest in loan collateral is invalidated or a senior loan were subordinated to other debt of an obligor in bankruptcy or other proceedings the fund would have substantially lower recovery and perhaps no recovery on the full amount of the principal and interest due on the loan or the fund could have to refund interest lenders and investors in loans can be sued by other creditors and shareholders of the obligors losses can be greater than the original loan amount and occur years after the principal and interest on the loan have been repaid   part ii   agent risk selling lenders agents and other entities who may be positioned between a fund and the obligor will likely conduct their principal business activities in the banking finance and financial services industries investments in loans may be more impacted by a single economic political or regulatory occurrence affecting such industries than other types of investments entities engaged in such industries may be more susceptible to among other things fluctuations in interest rates changes in the federal open market committee’s monetary policy government regulations concerning such industries and concerning capital raising activities generally and fluctuations in the financial markets generally an agent lender or other entity positioned between a fund and the obligor may become insolvent or enter fdic receivership or bankruptcy the fund might incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment on a loan or suffer a loss of principal andor interest if assets or interests held by the agent lender or other party positioned between the fund and the obligor are determined to be subject to the claims of the agent’s lender’s or such other party’s creditors regulatory changes to the extent that legislation or state or federal regulators that regulate certain financial institutions impose additional requirements or restrictions with respect to the ability of such institutions to make loans particularly in connection with highly leveraged transactions the availability of loans for investment may be adversely affected furthermore such legislation or regulation could depress the market value of loans held by the fund inventory risk affiliates of the adviser may participate in the primary and secondary market for loans because of limitations imposed by applicable law the presence of the adviser’s affiliates in the loan market may restrict a fund’s ability to acquire some loans affect the timing of such acquisition or affect the price at which the loan is acquired information risk there is typically less publicly available information concerning loans than other types of fixed income investments as a result a fund generally will be dependent on reports and other information provided by the obligor either directly or through an agent to evaluate the obligor’s creditworthiness or to determine the obligor’s compliance with the covenants and other terms of the loan agreement such reliance may make investments in loans more susceptible to fraud than other types of investments in addition because the adviser may wish to invest in the publicly traded securities of an obligor it may not have access to material nonpublic information regarding the obligor to which other loan investors have access junior loan risk junior loans are subject to the same general risks inherent to any loan investment due to their lower place in the obligor’s capital structure and possible unsecured status junior loans involve a higher degree of overall risk than senior loans of the same obligor junior loans that are bridge loans generally carry the expectation that the obligor will be able to obtain permanent financing in the near future any delay in obtaining permanent financing subjects the bridge loan investor to increased risk an obligor’s use of bridge loans also involves the risk that the obligor may be unable to locate permanent financing to replace the bridge loan which may impair the obligor’s perceived creditworthiness mezzanine loan risk in addition to the risk factors described above mezzanine loans are subject to additional risks unlike conventional mortgage loans mezzanine loans are not secured by a mortgage on the underlying real property but rather by a pledge of equity interests such as a partnership or limited liability company membership in the property owner or another company in the ownership structures that has control over the property such companies are typically structured as special purpose entities generally mezzanine loans may be more highly leveraged than other types of loans and subordinate in the capital structure of the obligor while foreclosure of a mezzanine loan generally takes substantially less time than foreclosure of a traditional mortgage the holders of a mezzanine loan have different remedies available versus the holder of a first lien mortgage loan in addition a sale of the underlying real property would not be unencumbered and thus would be subject to encumbrances by more senior mortgages and liens of other creditors upon foreclosure of a mezzanine loan the holder of the mezzanine loan acquires an equity interest in the obligor however because of the subordinate nature of a mezzanine loan the real property continues to be subject to the lien of the mortgage and other liens encumbering the real estate in the event the holder of a mezzanine loan forecloses on its equity collateral the holder may need to cure the obligor’s existing mortgage defaults or to the extent permissible under the governing agreements sell the property to pay off other creditors to the extent that the amount of mortgages and senior indebtedness and liens exceed the value of the real estate the collateral underlying the mezzanine loan may have little or no value foreclosure risk there may be additional costs associated with enforcing a fund’s remedies under a loan including additional legal costs and payment of real property transfer taxes upon foreclosure in certain jurisdictions as a result of these additional costs the fund may determine that pursuing foreclosure on the   part ii   loan collateral is not worth the associated costs in addition if the fund incurs costs and the collateral loses value or is not recovered by the fund in foreclosure the fund could lose more than its original investment in the loan foreclosure risk is heightened for junior loans including certain mezzanine loans miscellaneous investment strategies and risks borrowings a fund may borrow for temporary purposes andor for investment purposes such a practice will result in leveraging of a fund’s assets and may cause a fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so this borrowing may be secured or unsecured if a fund utilizes borrowings for investment purposes or otherwise it may pledge up to   of its total assets to secure such borrowings provisions of the  act require a fund to maintain continuous asset coverage that is total assets including borrowings less liabilities exclusive of borrowings of  of the amount borrowed with an exception for borrowings not in excess of  of the fund’s total assets made for temporary administrative or emergency purposes any borrowings for temporary administrative purposes in excess of  of the fund’s total assets must maintain continuous asset coverage if the  asset coverage should decline as a result of market fluctuations or other reasons a fund may be required to sell some of its portfolio holdings within three days to reduce the debt and restore the  asset coverage even though it may be disadvantageous from an investment standpoint to sell securities at that time borrowing will tend to exaggerate the effect on net asset value of any increase or decrease in the market value of a fund’s portfolio money borrowed will be subject to interest costs which may or may not be recovered by appreciation of the securities purchased a fund also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with such borrowing or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate certain types of investments are considered to be borrowings under precedents issued by the sec such investments are subject to the limitations as well as asset segregation requirements in addition each fund may enter into interfund lending arrangements please see “interfund lending” commoditylinked derivatives commoditylinked derivatives are derivative instruments the value of which is linked to the value of a commodity commodity index or commodity futures contract a fund’s investment in commoditylinked derivative instruments may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates the possibility for greater loss including the likelihood of greater volatility of the fund’s net asset value and there can be no assurance that a fund’s use of leverage will be successful tax considerations may limit a fund’s ability to pursue investments in commoditylinked derivatives commodityrelated pooled investment vehicles commodityrelated pooled investment vehicles include ownership interests in grantor trusts and other pooled investment vehicles that hold tangible assets such as gold silver or other commodities or invest in commodity futures grantor trusts are typically traded on an exchange investors do not have the rights normally associated with ownership of other types of shares when they invest in pooled investment vehicles holding commodities or commodity futures including those structured as limited partnerships or grantor trusts holding commodities for example the owners of these commodityrelated grantor trusts or limited partnerships do not have the right to elect directors receive dividends or take other actions normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation holders of a certain percentage of shares in a grantor trust may have the right to terminate the trust or exercise other rights which would not be available to small investors if investors other than a fund exercise their right to terminate a fund that wishes to invest in the underlying commodity through the pooled investment vehicle will have to find another investment and may not be able to find another vehicle that offers the same investment features in the event that one or more participants holding a substantial interest in these pooled investment vehicles withdraw from participation the liquidity of the pooled investment vehicle will likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of the pooled investment vehicle and result in a fund incurring a loss on its investments these pooled investment vehicles are not registered investment companies and many are not commodity pools and therefore do not have the protections available to those types of investments under federal securities or commodities laws for example unlike registered investment companies these vehicles are not subject to federal securities laws that limit transactions with affiliates require redemption of shares or limit sales load although   part ii   shares of these vehicles may be traded on an exchange there may be no active market for such shares and such shares may be highly illiquid these vehicles are subject to the risks associated with direct investments in commodities the market price of shares of these vehicles will be as unpredictable as the price of the underlying commodity many factors can cause a decline in the prices of commodities including a change in economic conditions such as a recession this risk is magnified when the commodity is used in manufacturing in addition the prices of commodities may be adversely impacted by a change in the attitude of speculators and investors toward the applicable commodity or a significant increase in commodity price hedging activity in addition the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the assets owned by the trust are lost damaged or of inferior quality the commodities represented by shares of a grantor trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales of the underlying commodities necessary to pay trust fees and expenses including expenses associated with indemnification of certain service providers to the pooled investment vehicle without increases in the price of the underlying commodity sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the investment will decline and a fund will incur a loss on its investment commodityrelated grantor trusts are passive investment vehicles this means that the value of the investment in a grantor trust may be adversely affected by trust losses that if the trust had been actively managed it might have been possible to avoid a fund’s intention to qualify as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code may limit its ability to make investments in grantor trusts or limited partnerships that invest in commodities or commodity futures cyber security risk as the use of technology has become more prevalent in the course of business the funds have become more susceptible to operational and financial risks associated with cyber security including theft loss misuse improper release corruption and destruction of or unauthorized access to confidential or highly restricted data relating to a fund and its shareholders and compromises or failures to systems networks devices and applications relating to the operations of a fund and its service providers cyber security risks may result in financial losses to a fund and its shareholders the inability of a fund to transact business with its shareholders delays or mistakes in the calculation of a fund’s nav or other materials provided to shareholders the inability to process transactions with shareholders or other parties violations of privacy and other laws regulatory fines penalties and reputational damage and compliance and remediation costs legal fees and other expenses a fund’s service providers including but not limited to its investment adviser any subadvisers administrator transfer agent and custodian or their agents financial intermediaries companies in which a fund invests and parties with which a fund engages in portfolio or other transactions also may be adversely impacted by cyber security risks in their own businesses which could result in losses to a fund or its shareholders while measures have been developed which are designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber security there is no guarantee that those measures will be effective particularly since the funds do not directly control the cyber security defenses or plans of their service providers financial intermediaries and companies in which they invest or with which they do business volcker rule risk section  of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and certain rules promulgated thereunder known as the volcker rule places restrictions on the activities of banking entities including the adviser and its affiliates and may impact the longterm viability of a fund under the volcker rule if the adviser or its affiliates own  or more of the ownership interests of a fund outside of the permitted seeding time period a fund could be subject to restrictions on trading that would adversely impact a fund’s ability to execute its investment strategy as a result the adviser andor its affiliates may be required to reduce their ownership interests in a fund at a time that is sooner than would otherwise be desirable this may require the sale of fund securities which may result in losses increased transaction costs and adverse tax consequences in addition the ongoing viability of a fund may be adversely impacted by the anticipated or actual redemption of fund shares owned by the adviser and its affiliates and could result in a fund’s liquidation exchangetraded notes “etns” are senior unsecured notes linked to an index like etfs they may be bought and sold like shares of stock on an exchange however etns have a different underlying structure while etf shares represent an interest in a portfolio of securities etns are structured products that are an obligation of the issuing bank whereby the bank agrees to pay a return based on the target index less any fees essentially these notes allow individual investors to have access to derivatives linked to commodities and assets such as oil currencies and foreign stock indexes etns combine certain aspects of bonds and etfs similar to etfs etns are traded on a major exchange eg the new york stock exchange during normal trading hours however investors can also hold the etn until maturity at maturity the issuer pays to the investor a cash amount equal to principal   part ii   amount subject to the day’s index factor etn returns are based upon the performance of a market index minus applicable fees etns do not make periodic coupon payments and provide no principal protection the value of an etn may be influenced by time to maturity level of supply and demand for the etn volatility and lack of liquidity in underlying commodities markets changes in the applicable interest rates changes in the issuer’s credit rating and economic legal political or geographic events that affect the referenced commodity the value of the etn may drop due to a downgrade in the issuer’s credit rating despite the underlying index remaining unchanged the timing and character of income and gains derived from etns is under consideration by the us treasury and internal revenue service and may also be affected by future legislation impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares under applicable regulations the adviser or an affiliate of the adviser may be required to reduce its seed investment or other ownership interest in a fund at a time that is sooner than the adviser or its affiliate otherwise would in addition to such redemptions of seed investment from time to time shareholders of a fund which may include the adviser or affiliates of the adviser or accounts for which the adviser or its affiliates serve as investment adviser or trustee or for certain funds affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in a fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause a fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on a fund’s performance to the extent that the fund is required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so which may result in a loss to the fund these transactions may result in higher portfolio turnover accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in capital gains or other income and increase transaction costs which may impact the fund’s expense ratio additionally a significant reduction in fund assets would result in fund expenses being spread over a small asset base potentially causing an increase in the fund’s expense ratio to the extent that such transactions result in shortterm capital gains such gains will generally be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate in addition to the above information the funds’ sais include disclosure of accounts holding more than  of a fund’s voting securities government intervention in financial markets events in the financial sector over the past several years have resulted in reduced liquidity in credit and fixed income markets and in an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets both domestically and internationally while entire markets have been impacted issuers that have exposure to the real estate mortgage and credit markets have been particularly affected these events and the potential for continuing market turbulence may have an adverse effect on the funds’ investments it is uncertain how long these conditions will continue recent instability in the financial markets has led governments and regulators around the world to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and in some cases a lack of liquidity governments their regulatory agencies or self regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the funds invest or the issuers of such instruments in ways that are unforeseeable legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the funds themselves are regulated such legislation or regulation could limit or preclude a fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective governments or their agencies may also acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions the implications of government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear and such a program may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity valuation and performance of a fund’s portfolio holdings furthermore volatile financial markets can expose the funds to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing portfolio instruments held by the funds interest bearing deposit facility as part of seeking to provide intraday liquidity certain money market funds generally set aside cash in an interest bearing deposit facility “ibdf” at a level estimated to meet the money market fund’s next business day’s intraday redemption orders under the ibdf each money market fund expects to retain a balance “designated balance” overnight in its custodial cash deposit account with jpmorgan chase bank at a level estimated to meet its next business day’s intraday redemption orders as redemption payments are processed for the money market fund on the next business day outgoing wires are debited from its account at the end of that day the money market fund seeks to allocate cash to the account to restore the designated balance a money market fund receives interest overnight on the designated balance interfund lending to satisfy redemption requests or to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls a fund may enter into lending agreements “interfund lending agreements” under which the fund would lend money and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from another jp morgan fund through a credit facility “interfund loan” subject to meeting the conditions of an sec exemptive order granted to the funds permitting such interfund   part ii   lending no fund may borrow more than the lesser of the amount permitted by section  of the  act or the amount permitted by its investment limitations all interfund loans will consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the fund otherwise would invest in shortterm repurchase agreements or other shortterm instruments if a fund has outstanding borrowings any interfund loans to the fund a will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan b will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral c will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan and in any event not over seven days and d will provide that if an event of default occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the fund the event of default will automatically without need for action or notice by the lending fund constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund lending agreement entitling the lending fund to call the interfund loan and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing fund a fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total  or less of its total assets provided that if the fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender including but not limited to another jp morgan fund the fund’s interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral if a fund’s total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow through the credit facility on a secured basis only a fund may not borrow through the credit facility nor from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would exceed the limits imposed by section  of the  act no fund may lend to another fund through the interfund lending credit facility if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the credit facility to exceed  of the lending fund’s net assets at the time of the loan a fund’s interfund loans to any one fund shall not exceed  of the lending fund’s net assets the duration of interfund loans is limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold but in no event may the duration exceed seven days loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition each interfund loan may be called on one business day’s notice by a lending fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing fund the limitations detailed above and the other conditions of the sec exemptive order permitting interfund lending are designed to minimize the risks associated with interfund lending for both the lending fund and the borrowing fund however no borrowing or lending activity is without risk when a fund borrows money from another fund there is a risk that the loan could be called on one day’s notice or not renewed in which case the fund may have to borrow from a bank at higher rates if an interfund loan were not available from another fund a delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost opportunity or additional lending costs master limited partnerships certain companies are organized as master limited partnerships “mlps” in which ownership interests are publicly traded mlps often own several properties or businesses or directly own interests that are related to real estate development and oil and gas industries but they also may finance motion pictures research and development and other projects or provide financial services generally an mlp is operated under the supervision of one or more managing general partners limited partners like a fund that invests in an mlp are not involved in the daytoday management of the partnership they are allocated income and capital gains associated with the partnership project in accordance with the terms established in the partnership agreement the risks of investing in an mlp are generally those inherent in investing in a partnership as opposed to a corporation for example state law governing partnerships is often less restrictive than state law governing corporations accordingly there may be fewer protections afforded investors in an mlp than investors in a corporation additional risks involved with investing in an mlp are risks associated with the specific industry or industries in which the partnership invests such as the risks of investing in real estate or oil and gas industries new financial products new options and futures contracts and other financial products and various combinations thereof including overthecounter products continue to be developed these various products may be used to adjust the risk and return characteristics of certain funds’ investments these various products may increase or decrease exposure to security prices interest rates commodity prices or other factors that affect security values regardless of the issuer’s credit risk if market conditions do not perform as expected the performance of a fund would be less favorable than it would have been if these products were not used in addition losses may occur if counterparties involved in transactions do not perform as promised these products may expose the fund to potentially greater return as well as potentially greater risk of loss than more traditional fixed income investments   part ii   private placements restricted securities and other unregistered securities subject to its policy limitation a fund may acquire investments that are illiquid or have limited liquidity such as commercial obligations issued in reliance on the socalled “private placement” exemption from registration afforded by section a under the securities act of  as amended the “ act” and cannot be offered for public sale in the us without first being registered under the  act an illiquid investment is any investment that cannot be disposed of within seven days in the normal course of business at approximately the amount at which it is valued by a fund the price a fund pays for illiquid securities or receives upon resale may be lower than the price paid or received for similar securities with a more liquid market accordingly the valuation of these securities will reflect any limitations on their liquidity a fund is subject to a risk that should the fund decide to sell illiquid securities when a ready buyer is not available at a price the fund deems representative of their value the value of the fund’s net assets could be adversely affected where an illiquid security must be registered under the  act before it may be sold a fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time the fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop a fund might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to sell the funds may invest in commercial paper issued in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by section a of the  act and other restricted securities ie other securities subject to restrictions on resale section a commercial paper “a paper” is restricted as to disposition under federal securities law and is generally sold to institutional investors such as the funds that agree that they are purchasing the paper for investment purposes and not with a view to public distribution any resale by the purchaser must be in an exempt transaction a paper is normally resold to other institutional investors through or with the assistance of the issuer or investment dealers who make a market in a paper thus providing liquidity the funds believe that a paper and possibly certain other restricted securities which meet the criteria for liquidity established by the trustees are quite liquid the funds intend therefore to treat restricted securities that meet the liquidity criteria established by the board of trustees including a paper and rule a securities as determined by the fund’s adviser as liquid and not subject to the investment limitation applicable to illiquid securities the ability of the trustees to determine the liquidity of certain restricted securities is permitted under an sec staff position set forth in the adopting release for rule a under the  act “rule a” rule a is a nonexclusive safeharbor for certain secondary market transactions involving securities subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities laws rule a provides an exemption from registration for resales of otherwise restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers rule a was expected to further enhance the liquidity of the secondary market for securities eligible for resale the funds believe that the staff of the sec has left the question of determining the liquidity of all restricted securities to the trustees the trustees have directed each fund’s adviser to consider the following criteria in determining the liquidity of certain restricted securities     •   the frequency of trades and quotes for the security     •   the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential buyers     •   dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and     •   the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades certain a paper programs cannot rely on rule a because among other things they were established before the adoption of the rule however the trustees may determine for purposes of the trust’s liquidity requirements that an issue of a paper is liquid if the following conditions which are set forth in a  sec noaction letter are met     •   the a paper must not be traded flat or in default as to principal or interest     •   the a paper must be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least two nrsros or if only one nrsro rates the security by that nrsro or if unrated is determined by a fund’s adviser to be of equivalent quality     •   the fund’s adviser must consider the trading market for the specific security taking into account all relevant factors including but not limited to whether the paper is the subject of a commercial paper program that is administered by an issuing and paying agent bank and for which there exists a dealer willing to make a market in that paper or whether the paper is administered by a direct issuer pursuant to a direct placement program   part ii     •   the fund’s adviser shall monitor the liquidity of the a paper purchased and shall report to the board of trustees promptly if any such securities are no longer determined to be liquid if such determination causes a fund to hold more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities in order for the board of trustees to consider what action if any should be taken on behalf of the trust unless the fund’s adviser is able to dispose of illiquid assets in an orderly manner in an amount that reduces the fund’s holdings of illiquid assets to less than  of its net assets and     •   the fund’s adviser shall report to the board of trustees on the appropriateness of the purchase and retention of liquid restricted securities under these guidelines no less frequently than quarterly securities issued in connection with reorganizations and corporate restructuring debt securities may be downgraded and issuers of debt securities including investment grade securities may default in the payment of principal or interest or be subject to bankruptcy proceedings in connection with reorganizing or restructuring of an issuer an issuer may issue common stock or other securities to holders of its debt securities a fund may hold such common stock and other securities even though it does not ordinarily invest in such securities stapled securities from time to time the funds may invest in stapled securities to gain exposure to companies a stapled security is a security that is comprised of two or more parts that cannot be separated from one another the resulting security is influenced by both parts and must be treated as one unit at all times such as when buying or selling a security the value of stapled securities and the income derived from them may fall as well as rise stapled securities are not obligations of deposits in or guaranteed by the fund the listing of stapled securities on a domestic or foreign exchange does not guarantee a liquid market for stapled securities temporary defensive positions to respond to unusual market conditions all of the funds may invest their assets in cash or cash equivalents cash equivalents are highly liquid high quality instruments with maturities of three months or less on the date they are purchased “cash equivalents” for temporary defensive purposes these investments may result in a lower yield than lowerquality or longer term investments and may prevent the funds from meeting their investment objectives the percentage of fund’s total assets that a fund may invest in cash or cash equivalents is described in the applicable fund’s prospectuses they include securities issued by the us government its agencies governmentsponsored enterprises “gses” and instrumentalities repurchase agreements with maturities of  days or less certificates of deposit bankers’ acceptances commercial paper money market mutual funds and bank deposit accounts in order to invest in repurchase agreements with the federal reserve bank of new york for temporary defensive purposes certain funds may engage in periodic “test” trading in order to assess operational abilities at times when the fund would otherwise not enter into such a position these exercises may vary in size and frequency mortgagerelated securities mortgages directly held mortgages are debt instruments secured by real property unlike mortgagebacked securities which generally represent an interest in a pool of mortgages direct investments in mortgages involve prepayment and credit risks of an individual issuer and real property consequently these investments require different investment and credit analysis by a fund’s adviser directly placed mortgages may include residential mortgages multifamily mortgages mortgages on cooperative apartment buildings commercial mortgages and saleleasebacks these investments are backed by assets such as office buildings shopping centers retail stores warehouses apartment buildings and singlefamily dwellings in the event that a fund forecloses on any nonperforming mortgage and acquires a direct interest in the real property such fund will be subject to the risks generally associated with the ownership of real property there may be fluctuations in the market value of the foreclosed property and its occupancy rates rent schedules and operating expenses there may also be adverse changes in local regional or general economic conditions deterioration of the real estate market and the financial circumstances of tenants and sellers unfavorable changes in zoning building environmental and other laws increased real property taxes rising interest rates reduced availability and increased cost of mortgage borrowings the need for unanticipated renovations unexpected increases in the cost of energy environmental factors acts of god and other factors which are beyond the control of a fund or the fund’s adviser hazardous or toxic substances may be present on at or under the mortgaged property and adversely affect the value of the property in addition the owners of property containing such substances may be held responsible under various laws for containing monitoring removing or cleaning up such substances the presence of such substances may also provide a basis for other claims by third parties costs of clean up or of liabilities to third parties may exceed the value of the property in addition these risks may be uninsurable in light of these and similar risks it may be impossible to dispose profitably of properties in foreclosure mortgagebacked securities “cmos” and “remics” mortgagebacked securities include collateralized mortgage obligations “cmos” and real estate mortgage investment conduits “remics” a remic is a cmo   part ii   that qualifies for special tax treatment under the code and invests in certain mortgages principally secured by interests in real property and other permitted investments mortgagebacked securities represent pools of mortgage loans assembled for sale to investors by     •   various governmental agencies such as the government national mortgage association “ginnie mae”     •   organizations such as the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and the federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” and     •   nongovernmental issuers such as commercial banks savings and loan institutions mortgage bankers and private mortgage insurance companies nongovernmental mortgage securities cannot be treated as us government securities for purposes of investment policies there are a number of important differences among the agencies gses and instrumentalities of the us government that issue mortgagerelated securities and among the securities that they issue ginnie mae securities mortgagerelated securities issued by ginnie mae include ginnie mae mortgage passthrough certificates which are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by ginnie mae ginnie mae’s guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the us ginnie mae is a whollyowned us government corporation within the department of housing and urban development ginnie mae certificates also are supported by the authority of ginnie mae to borrow funds from the us treasury to make payments under its guarantee fannie mae securities mortgagerelated securities issued by fannie mae include fannie mae guaranteed mortgage passthrough certificates which are solely the obligations of fannie mae and are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the us fannie mae is a governmentsponsored organization owned entirely by private stockholders fannie mae certificates are guaranteed as to timely payment of the principal and interest by fannie mae freddie mac securities mortgagerelated securities issued by freddie mac include freddie mac mortgage participation certificates freddie mac is a corporate instrumentality of the us created pursuant to an act of congress which is owned by private stockholders freddie mac certificates are not guaranteed by the us or by any federal home loan bank and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the us or of any federal home loan bank freddie mac certificates entitle the holder to timely payment of interest which is guaranteed by freddie mac freddie mac guarantees either ultimate collection or timely payment of all principal payments on the underlying mortgage loans when freddie mac does not guarantee timely payment of principal freddie mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time after default on an underlying mortgage but in no event later than one year after it becomes payable for more information on recent events impacting fannie mae and freddie mac securities see “recent events regarding fannie mae and freddie mac securities” under the heading “risk factors of mortgagerelated securities” below cmos and guaranteed remic passthrough certificates “remic certificates” issued by fannie mae freddie mac ginnie mae and private issuers are types of multiple class passthrough securities investors may purchase beneficial interests in remics which are known as “regular” interests or “residual” interests the funds do not currently intend to purchase residual interests in remics the remic certificates represent beneficial ownership interests in a remic trust generally consisting of mortgage loans or fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae guaranteed mortgage passthrough certificates the “mortgage assets” the obligations of fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae under their respective guaranty of the remic certificates are obligations solely of fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae respectively fannie mae remic certificates fannie mae remic certificates are issued and guaranteed as to timely distribution of principal and interest by fannie mae in addition fannie mae will be obligated to distribute the principal balance of each class of remic certificates in full whether or not sufficient funds are otherwise available freddie mac remic certificates freddie mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and also guarantees the payment of principal as payments are required to be made on the underlying mortgage participation certificates “pcs” pcs represent undivided interests in specified residential mortgages or participation therein purchased by freddie mac and placed in a pc pool with respect to principal payments on   part ii   pcs freddie mac generally guarantees ultimate collection of all principal of the related mortgage loans without offset or deduction freddie mac also guarantees timely payment of principal on certain pcs referred to as “gold pcs” ginnie mae remic certificates ginnie mae guarantees the full and timely payment of interest and principal on each class of securities in accordance with the terms of those classes as specified in the related offering circular supplement the ginnie mae guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the us remic certificates issued by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae are treated as us government securities for purposes of investment policies cmos and remic certificates provide for the redistribution of cash flow to multiple classes each class of cmos or remic certificates often referred to as a “tranche” is issued at a specific adjustable or fixed interest rate and must be fully retired no later than its final distribution date this reallocation of interest and principal results in the redistribution of prepayment risk across different classes this allows for the creation of bonds with more or less risk than the underlying collateral exhibits principal prepayments on the mortgage loans or the mortgage assets underlying the cmos or remic certificates may cause some or all of the classes of cmos or remic certificates to be retired substantially earlier than their final distribution dates generally interest is paid or accrues on all classes of cmos or remic certificates on a monthly basis the principal of and interest on the mortgage assets may be allocated among the several classes of cmos or remic certificates in various ways in certain structures known as “sequential pay” cmos or remic certificates payments of principal including any principal prepayments on the mortgage assets generally are applied to the classes of cmos or remic certificates in the order of their respective final distribution dates thus no payment of principal will be made on any class of sequential pay cmos or remic certificates until all other classes having an earlier final distribution date have been paid in full additional structures of cmos and remic certificates include among others principal only structures interest only structures inverse floaters and “parallel pay” cmos and remic certificates certain of these structures may be more volatile than other types of cmo and remic structures parallel pay cmos or remic certificates are those which are structured to apply principal payments and prepayments of the mortgage assets to two or more classes concurrently on a proportionate or disproportionate basis these simultaneous payments are taken into account in calculating the final distribution date of each class a wide variety of remic certificates may be issued in the parallel pay or sequential pay structures these securities include accrual certificates also known as “zbonds” which only accrue interest at a specified rate until all other certificates having an earlier final distribution date have been retired and are converted thereafter to an interestpaying security and planned amortization class “pac” certificates which are parallel pay remic certificates which generally require that specified amounts of principal be applied on each payment date to one or more classes of remic certificates the “pac certificates” even though all other principal payments and prepayments of the mortgage assets are then required to be applied to one or more other classes of the certificates the scheduled principal payments for the pac certificates generally have the highest priority on each payment date after interest due has been paid to all classes entitled to receive interest currently shortfalls if any are added to the amount of principal payable on the next payment date the pac certificate payment schedule is taken into account in calculating the final distribution date of each class of pac in order to create pac tranches one or more tranches generally must be created that absorb most of the volatility in the underlying mortgage assets these tranches tend to have market prices and yields that are much more volatile than the pac classes the zbonds in which the funds may invest may bear the same noncreditrelated risks as do other types of zbonds zbonds in which the fund may invest will not include residual interest total annual fund operating expenses set forth in the fee table and financial highlights section of each fund’s prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain structured or synthetic products that may rely on the exception for the definition of “investment company” provided by section c or c of the  act mortgage tbas a fund may invest in mortgage passthrough securities eligible to be sold in the “tobeannounced” or tba market “mortgage tbas” mortgage tbas provide for the forward or delayed delivery of the underlying instrument with settlement up to  days the term tba comes from the fact that the actual mortgagebacked security that will be delivered to fulfill a tba trade is not designated at the time the trade is made but rather is generally announced  hours before the settlement date mortgage tbas are subject to the risks described in the “whenissued securities delayed delivery securities and forward commitments” section   part ii   mortgage dollar rolls in a mortgage dollar roll transaction one party sells mortgagebacked securities principally mortgage tbas for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts with the same counterparty to repurchase similar same type coupon and maturity but not identical securities on a specified future date when a fund enters into tbasmortgage dollar rolls the fund will segregate or earmark until the settlement date liquid assets in an amount equal to the original purchase price tba positions with the same agency coupon and maturity are generally permitted to be netted if the short position settles on the same date or before the long position during the period between the sale and repurchase in a mortgage dollar roll transaction the fund will not be entitled to receive interest and principal payments on securities sold losses may arise due to changes in the value of the securities or if the counterparty does not perform under the terms of the agreement if the counterparty files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent the fund’s right to repurchase or sell securities may be limited mortgage dollar rolls may be subject to leverage risks in addition mortgage dollar rolls may increase interest rate risk and result in an increased portfolio turnover rate which increases costs and may increase taxable gains the benefits of mortgage dollar rolls may depend upon a fund’s adviser’s ability to predict mortgage prepayments and interest rates there is no assurance that mortgage dollar rolls can be successfully employed for purposes of diversification and investment limitations mortgage dollar rolls are considered to be mortgagebacked securities stripped mortgagebacked securities stripped mortgagebacked securities “smbs” are derivative multiclass mortgage securities issued outside the remic or cmo structure smbs are usually structured with two classes that receive different proportions of the interest and principal distributions from a pool of mortgage assets a common type of smbs will have one class receiving all of the interest from the mortgage assets “ios” while the other class will receive all of the principal “pos” mortgage ios receive monthly interest payments based upon a notional amount that declines over time as a result of the normal monthly amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal on the associated mortgage pos in addition to the risks applicable to mortgagerelated securities in general smbs are subject to the following additional risks prepaymentinterest rate sensitivity smbs are extremely sensitive to changes in prepayments and interest rates even though these securities have been guaranteed by an agency or instrumentality of the us government under certain interest rate or prepayment rate scenarios the funds may lose money on investments in smbs interest only smbs changes in prepayment rates can cause the return on investment in ios to be highly volatile under extremely high prepayment conditions ios can incur significant losses principal only smbs pos are bought at a discount to the ultimate principal repayment value the rate of return on a po will vary with prepayments rising as prepayments increase and falling as prepayments decrease generally the market value of these securities is unusually volatile in response to changes in interest rates yield characteristics although smbs may yield more than other mortgagebacked securities their cash flow patterns are more volatile and there is a greater risk that any premium paid will not be fully recouped a fund’s adviser will seek to manage these risks and potential benefits by investing in a variety of such securities and by using certain analytical and hedging techniques adjustable rate mortgage loans certain funds may invest in adjustable rate mortgage loans “arms” arms eligible for inclusion in a mortgage pool will generally provide for a fixed initial mortgage interest rate for a specified period of time thereafter the interest rates the “mortgage interest rates” may be subject to periodic adjustment based on changes in the applicable index rate the “index rate” the adjusted rate would be equal to the index rate plus a gross margin which is a fixed percentage spread over the index rate established for each arm at the time of its origination adjustable interest rates can cause payment increases that some borrowers may find difficult to make however certain arms may provide that the mortgage interest rate may not be adjusted to a rate above an applicable lifetime maximum rate or below an applicable lifetime minimum rate for such arm certain arms may also be subject to limitations on the maximum amount by which the mortgage interest rate may adjust for any single adjustment period the “maximum adjustment” other arms “negatively amortizing arms” may provide instead or as well for limitations on changes in the monthly payment on such arms limitations on monthly payments can result in monthly payments which are greater or less than the amount necessary to amortize a negatively amortizing arm by its maturity at the mortgage interest rate in effect in any particular month in the event that a monthly payment is not sufficient to pay the interest accruing on a negatively amortizing arm any such excess interest is added to the principal balance of the loan causing negative amortization and will be repaid through future monthly payments it may take borrowers under negatively amortizing arms longer periods of   part ii   time to achieve equity and may increase the likelihood of default by such borrowers in the event that a monthly payment exceeds the sum of the interest accrued at the applicable mortgage interest rate and the principal payment which would have been necessary to amortize the outstanding principal balance over the remaining term of the loan the excess or “accelerated amortization” further reduces the principal balance of the arm negatively amortizing arms do not provide for the extension of their original maturity to accommodate changes in their mortgage interest rate as a result unless there is a periodic recalculation of the payment amount which there generally is the final payment may be substantially larger than the other payments these limitations on periodic increases in interest rates and on changes in monthly payments protect borrowers from unlimited interest rate and payment increases certain arms may provide for periodic adjustments of scheduled payments in order to amortize fully the mortgage loan by its stated maturity other arms may permit their stated maturity to be extended or shortened in accordance with the portion of each payment that is applied to interest as affected by the periodic interest rate adjustments there are two main categories of indices which provide the basis for rate adjustments on arms those based on us treasury securities and those derived from a calculated measure such as a cost of funds index or a moving average of mortgage rates commonly utilized indices include the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear constant maturity treasury bill rates the threemonth treasury bill rate the day treasury bill rate rates on longerterm treasury securities the th district federal home loan bank cost of funds the national median cost of funds the onemonth threemonth sixmonth or oneyear london interbank offered rate “libor” the prime rate of a specific bank or commercial paper rates some indices such as the oneyear constant maturity treasury rate closely mirror changes in market interest rate levels others such as the th district federal home loan bank cost of funds index tend to lag behind changes in market rate levels and tend to be somewhat less volatile the degree of volatility in the market value of the fund’s portfolio and therefore in the net asset value of the fund’s shares will be a function of the length of the interest rate reset periods and the degree of volatility in the applicable indices in general changes in both prepayment rates and interest rates will change the yield on mortgagebacked securities the rate of principal prepayments with respect to arms has fluctuated in recent years as is the case with fixed mortgage loans arms may be subject to a greater rate of principal prepayments in a declining interest rate environment for example if prevailing interest rates fall significantly arms could be subject to higher prepayment rates than if prevailing interest rates remain constant because the availability of fixed rate mortgage loans at competitive interest rates may encourage mortgagors to refinance their arms to “lockin” a lower fixed interest rate conversely if prevailing interest rates rise significantly arms may prepay at lower rates than if prevailing rates remain at or below those in effect at the time such arms were originated as with fixed rate mortgages there can be no certainty as to the rate of prepayments on the arms in either stable or changing interest rate environments in addition there can be no certainty as to whether increases in the principal balances of the arms due to the addition of deferred interest may result in a default rate higher than that on arms that do not provide for negative amortization other factors affecting prepayment of arms include changes in mortgagors’ housing needs job transfers unemployment mortgagors’ net equity in the mortgage properties and servicing decisions risk factors of mortgagerelated securities the following is a summary of certain risks associated with mortgagerelated securities guarantor risk there can be no assurance that the us government would provide financial support to fannie mae or freddie mac if necessary in the future although certain mortgagerelated securities are guaranteed by a third party or otherwise similarly secured the market value of the security which may fluctuate is not so secured interest rate sensitivity if a fund purchases a mortgagerelated security at a premium that portion may be lost if there is a decline in the market value of the security whether resulting from changes in interest rates or prepayments in the underlying mortgage collateral as with other interestbearing securities the prices of such securities are inversely affected by changes in interest rates although the value of a mortgagerelated security may decline when interest rates rise the converse is not necessarily true since in periods of declining interest rates the mortgages underlying the securities are prone to prepayment for this and other reasons a mortgagerelated security’s stated maturity may be shortened by unscheduled prepayments on the underlying mortgages and therefore it is not possible to predict accurately the security’s return to the fund in addition regular payments received in respect of mortgagerelated securities include both interest and principal no assurance can be given as to the return the fund will receive when these amounts are reinvested liquidity the liquidity of certain mortgagebacked securities varies by type of security at certain times the fund may encounter difficulty in disposing of such investments in the past in stressed markets certain types of mortgage   part ii   backed securities suffered periods of illiquidity when disfavored by the market it is possible that the fund may be unable to sell a mortgagebacked security at a desirable time or at the value the fund has placed on the investment market value the market value of the fund’s adjustable rate mortgagebacked securities may be adversely affected if interest rates increase faster than the rates of interest payable on such securities or by the adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying such securities furthermore adjustable rate mortgagebacked securities or the mortgage loans underlying such securities may contain provisions limiting the amount by which rates may be adjusted upward and downward and may limit the amount by which monthly payments may be increased or decreased to accommodate upward and downward adjustments in interest rates when the market value of the properties underlying the mortgagebacked securities suffer broad declines on a regional or national level the values of the corresponding mortgagebacked securities or mortgagebacked securities as a whole may be adversely affected as well prepayments adjustable rate mortgagebacked securities have less potential for capital appreciation than fixed rate mortgagebacked securities because their coupon rates will decline in response to market interest rate declines the market value of fixed rate mortgagebacked securities may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates and because of the risk of unscheduled principal prepayments may benefit less than other fixed rate securities of similar maturity from declining interest rates finally to the extent mortgagebacked securities are purchased at a premium mortgage foreclosures and unscheduled principal prepayments may result in some loss of the fund’s principal investment to the extent of the premium paid on the other hand if such securities are purchased at a discount both a scheduled payment of principal and an unscheduled prepayment of principal will increase current and total returns and will accelerate the recognition of income yield characteristics the yield characteristics of mortgagebacked securities differ from those of traditional fixed income securities the major differences typically include more frequent interest and principal payments usually monthly and the possibility that prepayments of principal may be made at any time prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic geographic social and other factors and cannot be predicted with certainty as with fixed rate mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgage loans may be subject to a greater prepayment rate in a declining interest rate environment the yields to maturity of the mortgagebacked securities in which the funds invest will be affected by the actual rate of payment including prepayments of principal of the underlying mortgage loans the mortgage loans underlying such securities generally may be prepaid at any time without penalty in a fluctuating interest rate environment a predominant factor affecting the prepayment rate on a pool of mortgage loans is the difference between the interest rates on the mortgage loans and prevailing mortgage loan interest rates taking into account the cost of any refinancing in general if mortgage loan interest rates fall sufficiently below the interest rates on fixed rate mortgage loans underlying mortgage passthrough securities the rate of prepayment would be expected to increase conversely if mortgage loan interest rates rise above the interest rates on the fixed rate mortgage loans underlying the mortgage passthrough securities the rate of prepayment may be expected to decrease recent events regarding fannie mae and freddie mac securities on september   the federal housing finance agency “fhfa” placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship as the conservator fhfa succeeded to all rights titles powers and privileges of fannie mae and freddie mac and of any stockholder officer or director of fannie mae and freddie mac with respect to fannie mae and freddie mac and the assets of fannie mae and freddie mac fhfa selected a new chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors for each of fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with the conservatorship the us treasury entered into a senior preferred stock purchase agreement with each of fannie mae and freddie mac pursuant to which the us treasury will purchase up to an aggregate of  billion of each of fannie mae and freddie mac to maintain a positive net worth in each enterprise this agreement contains various covenants discussed below that severely limit each enterprise’s operations in exchange for entering into these agreements the us treasury received  billion of each enterprise’s senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase  of each enterprise’s common stock in  the us treasury announced that it was doubling the size of its commitment to each enterprise under the senior preferred stock program to  billion the us treasury’s obligations under the senior preferred stock program are for an indefinite period of time for a maximum amount of  billion per enterprise in  the us treasury further amended the senior preferred stock purchase agreement to allow the cap on the us treasury’s funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate any cumulative reduction in fannie mae’s and freddie mac’s net worth through the end of  in august  the senior preferred stock purchase agreement was further amended to among other things accelerate the wind down of the retained portfolio terminate the requirement that fannie mae and freddie mac each pay a  dividend annually on all amounts received under the funding commitment and require the submission of an annual risk management plan to the us treasury   part ii   fannie mae and freddie mac are continuing to operate as going concerns while in conservatorship and each remain liable for all of its obligations including its guaranty obligations associated with its mortgagebacked securities the senior preferred stock purchase agreement is intended to enhance each of fannie mae’s and freddie mac’s ability to meet its obligations the fhfa has indicated that the conservatorship of each enterprise will end when the director of fhfa determines that fhfa’s plan to restore the enterprise to a safe and solvent condition has been completed under the federal housing finance regulatory reform act of  the “reform act” which was included as part of the housing and economic recovery act of  fhfa as conservator or receiver has the power to repudiate any contract entered into by fannie mae or freddie mac prior to fhfa’s appointment as conservator or receiver as applicable if fhfa determines in its sole discretion that performance of the contract is burdensome and that repudiation of the contract promotes the orderly administration of fannie mae’s or freddie mac’s affairs the reform act requires fhfa to exercise its right to repudiate any contract within a reasonable period of time after its appointment as conservator or receiver fhfa in its capacity as conservator has indicated that it has no intention to repudiate the guaranty obligations of fannie mae or freddie mac because fhfa views repudiation as incompatible with the goals of the conservatorship however in the event that fhfa as conservator or if it is later appointed as receiver for fannie mae or freddie mac were to repudiate any such guaranty obligation the conservatorship or receivership estate as applicable would be liable for actual direct compensatory damages in accordance with the provisions of the reform act any such liability could be satisfied only to the extent of fannie mae’s or freddie mac’s assets available therefor in the event of repudiation the payments of interest to holders of fannie mae or freddie mac mortgagebacked securities would be reduced if payments on the mortgage loans represented in the mortgage loan groups related to such mortgagebacked securities are not made by the borrowers or advanced by the servicer any actual direct compensatory damages for repudiating these guaranty obligations may not be sufficient to offset any shortfalls experienced by such mortgagebacked security holders further in its capacity as conservator or receiver fhfa has the right to transfer or sell any asset or liability of fannie mae or freddie mac without any approval assignment or consent although fhfa has stated that it has no present intention to do so if fhfa as conservator or receiver were to transfer any such guaranty obligation to another party holders of fannie mae or freddie mac mortgagebacked securities would have to rely on that party for satisfaction of the guaranty obligation and would be exposed to the credit risk of that party in addition certain rights provided to holders of mortgagebacked securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac under the operative documents related to such securities may not be enforced against fhfa or enforcement of such rights may be delayed during the conservatorship or any future receivership the operative documents for fannie mae and freddie mac mortgagebacked securities may provide or with respect to securities issued prior to the date of the appointment of the conservator may have provided that upon the occurrence of an event of default on the part of fannie mae or freddie mac in its capacity as guarantor which includes the appointment of a conservator or receiver holders of such mortgagebacked securities have the right to replace fannie mae or freddie mac as trustee if the requisite percentage of mortgagebacked securities holders consent the reform act prevents mortgagebacked security holders from enforcing such rights if the event of default arises solely because a conservator or receiver has been appointed the reform act also provides that no person may exercise any right or power to terminate accelerate or declare an event of default under certain contracts to which fannie mae or freddie mac is a party or obtain possession of or exercise control over any property of fannie mae or freddie mac or affect any contractual rights of fannie mae or freddie mac without the approval of fhfa as conservator or receiver for a period of  or  days following the appointment of fhfa as conservator or receiver respectively in addition in a february  report to congress from the treasury department and the department of housing and urban development the obama administration provided a plan to reform america’s housing finance market the plan would reduce the role of and eventually eliminate fannie mae and freddie mac notably the plan does not propose similar significant changes to ginnie mae which guarantees payments on mortgagerelated securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans such as those issued by the federal housing association or guaranteed by the department of veterans affairs the report also identified three proposals for congress and the administration to consider for the longterm structure of the housing finance markets after the elimination of fannie mae and freddie mac including implementing i a privatized system of housing finance that limits government insurance to very limited groups of creditworthy low and moderateincome borrowers ii a privatized system with a government backstop mechanism that would allow the government to insure a larger share of the housing finance market during a future housing crisis and iii a privatized system where the government would offer reinsurance to holders of certain highlyrated mortgagerelated securities insured by private insurers and would pay out under the reinsurance arrangements only if the private mortgage insurers were insolvent   part ii   the conditions attached to the financial contribution made by the treasury to freddie mac and fannie mae and the issuance of senior preferred stock place significant restrictions on the activities of freddie mac and fannie mae freddie mac and fannie mae must obtain the consent of the treasury to among other things i make any payment to purchase or redeem its capital stock or pay any dividend other than in respect of the senior preferred stock ii issue capital stock of any kind iii terminate the conservatorship of the fhfa except in connection with a receivership or iv increase its debt beyond certain specified levels in addition significant restrictions are placed on the maximum size of each of freddie mac’s and fannie mae’s respective portfolios of mortgages and mortgagebacked securities and the purchase agreements entered into by freddie mac and fannie mae provide that the maximum size of their portfolios of these assets must decrease by a specified percentage each year the future status and role of freddie mac and fannie mae could be impacted by among other things the actions taken and restrictions placed on freddie mac and fannie mae by the fhfa in is role as conservator the restrictions placed on freddie mac’s and fannie mae’s operations and activities as a result of the senior preferred stock investment made by the us treasury market responses to developments at freddie mac and fannie mac and future legislative and regulatory action that alters the operations ownership structure andor mission of these institutions each of which may in turn impact the value of and cash flows on any mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by freddie mac and fannie mae including any such mortgagebacked securities held by a fund municipal securities municipal securities are issued to obtain funds for a wide variety of reasons for example municipal securities may be issued to obtain funding for the construction of a wide range of public facilities such as      bridges      highways      roads      schools      waterworks and sewer systems and      other utilities other public purposes for which municipal securities may be issued include      refunding outstanding obligations      obtaining funds for general operating expenses and      obtaining funds to lend to other public institutions and facilities in addition certain debt obligations known as “private activity bonds” may be issued by or on behalf of municipalities and public authorities to obtain funds to provide      water sewage and solid waste facilities      qualified residential rental projects      certain local electric gas and other heating or cooling facilities      qualified hazardous waste facilities      highspeed intercity rail facilities      governmentallyowned airports docks and wharves and mass transportation facilities      qualified mortgages      student loan and redevelopment bonds and      bonds used for certain organizations exempt from federal income taxation certain debt obligations known as “industrial development bonds” under prior federal tax law may have been issued by or on behalf of public authorities to obtain funds to provide      privately operated housing facilities      sports facilities   part ii      industrial parks      convention or trade show facilities      airport mass transit port or parking facilities      air or water pollution control facilities      sewage or solid waste disposal facilities and      facilities for water supply other private activity bonds and industrial development bonds issued to fund the construction improvement equipment or repair of privatelyoperated industrial distribution research or commercial facilities may also be municipal securities however the size of such issues is limited under current and prior federal tax law the aggregate amount of most private activity bonds and industrial development bonds is limited except in the case of certain types of facilities under federal tax law by an annual “volume cap” the volume cap limits the annual aggregate principal amount of such obligations issued by or on behalf of all governmental instrumentalities in the state the two principal classifications of municipal securities consist of “general obligation” and “limited” or revenue issues general obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from the issuer’s general unrestricted revenues and not from any particular fund or source the characteristics and method of enforcement of general obligation bonds vary according to the law applicable to the particular issuer and payment may be dependent upon appropriation by the issuer’s legislative body limited obligation bonds are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source private activity bonds and industrial development bonds generally are revenue bonds and thus not payable from the unrestricted revenues of the issuer the credit and quality of such bonds is generally related to the credit of the bank selected to provide the letter of credit underlying the bond payment of principal of and interest on industrial development revenue bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user and any guarantor the funds may also acquire “moral obligation” issues which are normally issued by special purpose authorities and in other taxexempt investments including pollution control bonds and taxexempt commercial paper each fund that may purchase municipal bonds may purchase      shortterm taxexempt general obligations notes      tax anticipation notes      bond anticipation notes      revenue anticipation notes      project notes and      other forms of shortterm taxexempt loans such notes are issued with a shortterm maturity in anticipation of the receipt of tax funds the proceeds of bond placements or other revenues project notes are issued by a state or local housing agency and are sold by the department of housing and urban development while the issuing agency has the primary obligation with respect to its project notes they are also secured by the full faith and credit of the us through agreements with the issuing authority which provide that if required the federal government will lend the issuer an amount equal to the principal of and interest on the project notes there are of course variations in the quality of municipal securities both within a particular classification and between classifications also the yields on municipal securities depend upon a variety of factors including      general money market conditions      coupon rate      the financial condition of the issuer      general conditions of the municipal bond market      the size of a particular offering      the maturity of the obligations and      the rating of the issue   part ii   the ratings of moody’s and sp represent their opinions as to the quality of municipal securities however ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality municipal securities with the same maturity interest rate and rating may have different yields while municipal securities of the same maturity and interest rate with different ratings may have the same yield subsequent to its purchase by a fund an issue of municipal securities may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum rating required for purchase by the fund the adviser will consider such an event in determining whether the fund should continue to hold the obligations municipal securities may include obligations of municipal housing authorities and singlefamily mortgage revenue bonds weaknesses in federal housing subsidy programs and their administration may result in a decrease of subsidies available for payment of principal and interest on housing authority bonds economic developments including fluctuations in interest rates and increasing construction and operating costs may also adversely impact revenues of housing authorities in the case of some housing authorities inability to obtain additional financing could also reduce revenues available to pay existing obligations singlefamily mortgage revenue bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption at par in whole or in part from the proceeds derived from prepayments of underlying mortgage loans and also from the unused proceeds of the issue within a stated period which may be within a year from the date of issue municipal leases are obligations issued by state and local governments or authorities to finance the acquisition of equipment and facilities municipal leases may be considered to be illiquid they may take the form of a lease an installment purchase contract a conditional sales contract or a participation interest in any of the above the board of trustees is responsible for determining the credit quality of unrated municipal leases on an ongoing basis including an assessment of the likelihood that the lease will not be canceled premium securities during a period of declining interest rates many municipal securities in which the funds invest likely will bear coupon rates higher than current market rates regardless of whether the securities were initially purchased at a premium risk factors in municipal securities the following is a summary of certain risks associated with municipal securities tax risk the code imposes certain continuing requirements on issuers of taxexempt bonds regarding the use expenditure and investment of bond proceeds and the payment of rebates to the us failure by the issuer to comply subsequent to the issuance of taxexempt bonds with certain of these requirements could cause interest on the bonds to become includable in gross income retroactive to the date of issuance housing authority tax risk the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes for certain housing authority bonds depends on qualification under relevant provisions of the code and on other provisions of federal law these provisions of federal law contain requirements relating to the cost and location of the residences financed with the proceeds of the singlefamily mortgage bonds and the income levels of tenants of the rental projects financed with the proceeds of the multifamily housing bonds typically the issuers of the bonds and other parties including the originators and servicers of the singlefamily mortgages and the owners of the rental projects financed with the multifamily housing bonds covenant to meet these requirements however there is no assurance that the requirements will be met if such requirements are not met     •   the interest on the bonds may become taxable possibly retroactively from the date of issuance     •   the value of the bonds may be reduced     •   you and other shareholders may be subject to unanticipated tax liabilities     •   a fund may be required to sell the bonds at the reduced value     •   it may be an event of default under the applicable mortgage     •   the holder may be permitted to accelerate payment of the bond and     •   the issuer may be required to redeem the bond in addition if the mortgage securing the bonds is insured by the federal housing administration “fha” the consent of the fha may be required before insurance proceeds would become payable information risk information about the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities may be less available than that of corporations having a class of securities registered under the sec   part ii   state and federal laws an issuer’s obligations under its municipal securities are subject to the provisions of bankruptcy insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors these laws may extend the time for payment of principal or interest or restrict the fund’s ability to collect payments due on municipal securities in addition recent amendments to some statutes governing security interests eg revised article  of the uniform commercial code “ucc” change the way in which security interests and liens securing municipal securities are perfected these amendments may have an adverse impact on existing municipal securities particularly issues of municipal securities that do not have a corporate trustee who is responsible for filing ucc financing statements to continue the security interest or lien litigation and current developments litigation or other conditions may materially and adversely affect the power or ability of an issuer to meet its obligations for the payment of interest on and principal of its municipal securities such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing uncertainties in the market for taxexempt obligations or may materially affect the credit risk with respect to particular bonds or notes adverse economic business legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial portion of a fund’s municipal securities in the same manner new legislation from time to time proposals have been introduced before congress for the purpose of restricting or eliminating the federal income tax exemption for interest on tax exempt bonds and similar proposals may be introduced in the future the supreme court has held that congress has the constitutional authority to enact such legislation it is not possible to determine what effect the adoption of such proposals could have on i the availability of municipal securities for investment by the funds and ii the value of the investment portfolios of the funds limitations on the use of municipal securities certain funds may invest in municipal securities if the adviser determines that such municipal securities offer attractive yields the funds may invest in municipal securities either by purchasing them directly or by purchasing certificates of accrual or similar instruments evidencing direct ownership of interest payments or principal payments or both on municipal securities provided that in the opinion of counsel to the initial seller of each such certificate or instrument any discount accruing on such certificate or instrument that is purchased at a yield not greater than the coupon rate of interest on the related municipal securities will to the same extent as interest on such municipal securities be exempt from federal income tax and state income tax where applicable and not be treated as a preference item for individuals for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax the funds may also invest in municipal securities by purchasing from banks participation interests in all or part of specific holdings of municipal securities such participation interests may be backed in whole or in part by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of the selling bank the selling bank may receive a fee from a fund in connection with the arrangement each fund will limit its investment in municipal leases to no more than  of its total assets options and futures transactions a fund may purchase and sell a exchange traded and otc put and call options on securities on indexes of securities and other types of instruments and on futures contracts on securities and indexes of securities and other instruments such as interest rate futures and global interest rate futures and b futures contracts on securities and other types of instruments and on indexes of securities and other types of instruments each of these instruments is a derivative instrument as its value derives from the underlying asset or index subject to its investment objective and policies a fund may use futures contracts and options for hedging and risk management purposes and to seek to enhance portfolio performance options and futures contracts may be used to manage a fund’s exposure to changing interest rates andor security prices some options and futures strategies including selling futures contracts and buying puts tend to hedge a fund’s investments against price fluctuations other strategies including buying futures contracts and buying calls tend to increase market exposure options and futures contracts may be combined with each other or with forward contracts in order to adjust the risk and return characteristics of a fund’s overall strategy in a manner deemed appropriate by the fund’s adviser and consistent with the fund’s objective and policies because combined options positions involve multiple trades they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out the use of options and futures is a highly specialized activity which involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions and there can be no guarantee that their use will increase a fund’s return while the use of these instruments by a fund may reduce certain risks associated with owning its portfolio securities these techniques themselves entail certain other risks if a fund’s adviser applies   part ii   a strategy at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions or trends incorrectly options and futures strategies may lower a fund’s return certain strategies limit a fund’s possibilities to realize gains as well as its exposure to losses a fund could also experience losses if the prices of its options and futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it could not close out its positions because of an illiquid secondary market in addition the fund will incur transaction costs including trading commissions and option premiums in connection with its futures and options transactions and these transactions could significantly increase the fund’s turnover rate certain funds have filed a notice under the commodity exchange act under regulation  and are operated by a person that has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the commodity exchange act and therefore is not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the commodity exchange act certain other funds may rely on no action relief issued by the cftc purchasing put and call options by purchasing a put option a fund obtains the right but not the obligation to sell the instrument underlying the option at a fixed strike price in return for this right a fund pays the current market price for the option known as the option premium options have various types of underlying instruments including specific securities indexes of securities indexes of securities prices and futures contracts a fund may terminate its position in a put option it has purchased by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option a fund may also close out a put option position by entering into an offsetting transaction if a liquid market exists if the option is allowed to expire a fund will lose the entire premium it paid if a fund exercises a put option on a security it will sell the instrument underlying the option at the strike price if a fund exercises an option on an index settlement is in cash and does not involve the actual purchase or sale of securities if an option is american style it may be exercised on any day up to its expiration date a european style option may be exercised only on its expiration date the buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if the value of the underlying instrument falls substantially however if the price of the instrument underlying the option does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option a put buyer can expect to suffer a loss limited to the amount of the premium paid plus related transaction costs the features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to purchase rather than sell the instrument underlying the option at the option’s strike price a call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential price increases of the instrument underlying the option with risk limited to the cost of the option if security prices fall at the same time the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option selling writing put and call options on securities when a fund writes a put option on a security it takes the opposite side of the transaction from the option’s purchaser in return for the receipt of the premium a fund assumes the obligation to pay the strike price for the security underlying the option if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it a fund may seek to terminate its position in a put option it writes before exercise by purchasing an offsetting option in the market at its current price if the market is not liquid for a put option a fund has written however it must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is outstanding regardless of price changes and must continue to post margin as discussed below if the market value of the underlying securities does not move to a level that would make exercise of the option profitable to its holder the option will generally expire unexercised and the fund will realize as profit the premium it received if the price of the underlying securities rises a put writer would generally expect to profit although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received if security prices remain the same over time it is likely that the writer will also profit because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price if security prices fall the put writer would expect to suffer a loss this loss should be less than the loss from purchasing and holding the underlying security directly however because the premium received for writing the option should offset a portion of the decline writing a call option obligates a fund to sell or deliver the option’s underlying security in return for the strike price upon exercise of the option the characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall through receipt of the option premium a call writer offsets part of the effect of a price decline at the same time because a call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price even if its current value is greater a call writer gives up some ability to participate in security price increases in order to meet its asset coverage requirements when a fund writes an exchange traded put or call option on a security it will be required to deposit cash or securities or a letter of credit as margin and to make mark to market payments of variation margin as the position becomes unprofitable   part ii   certain funds will usually sell covered call options or cashsecured put options on securities a call option is covered if the writer either owns the underlying security or comparable securities satisfying the cover requirements of the securities exchanges or has the right to acquire such securities a put option is cashsecured if the writer segregates cash highgrade shortterm debt obligations or other permissible collateral equal to the exercise price as the writer of a covered call option the fund foregoes during the option’s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline as the fund writes covered calls over more of its portfolio its ability to benefit from capital appreciation becomes more limited the writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation but may terminate its position by entering into an offsetting option once an option writer has received an exercise notice it cannot effect an offsetting transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price when the fund writes cashsecured put options it bears the risk of loss if the value of the underlying stock declines below the exercise price minus the put premium if the option is exercised the fund could incur a loss if it is required to purchase the stock underlying the put option at a price greater than the market price of the stock at the time of exercise plus the put premium the fund received when it wrote the option while the fund’s potential gain in writing a cashsecured put option is limited to distributions earned on the liquid assets securing the put option plus the premium received from the purchaser of the put option the fund risks a loss equal to the entire exercise price of the option minus the put premium engaging in straddles and spreads in a straddle transaction a fund either buys a call and a put or sells a call and a put on the same security in a spread a fund purchases and sells a call or a put a fund will sell a straddle when the fund’s adviser believes the price of a security will be stable the fund will receive a premium on the sale of the put and the call a spread permits a fund to make a hedged investment that the price of a security will increase or decline options on indexes certain funds may purchase and sell options on securities indexes and other types of indexes options on indexes are similar to options on securities except that the exercise of index options may be settled by cash payments or in some instances by a futures contract and does not involve the actual purchase or sale of securities or the instruments in the index in addition these options are designed to reflect price fluctuations in a group of securities or instruments or segment of the securities’ or instruments’ market rather than price fluctuations in a single security or instrument a fund in purchasing or selling index options is subject to the risk that the value of its portfolio may not change as much as an index because a fund’s investments generally will not match the composition of an index unlike call options on securities index options are cash settled or settled with a futures contract in some instances rather than settled by delivery of the underlying index securities or instruments certain funds purchase and sell credit options which are options on indexes of derivative instruments such as credit default swap indexes like other index options credit options can be cash settled or settled with a futures contract in some instances in addition credit options can also be settled in some instances by delivery of the underlying index instrument credit options may be used for a variety of purposes including hedging risk management such as positioning a portfolio for anticipated volatility or increasing income or gain to a fund there is no guarantee that the strategy of using options on indexes or credit options in particular will be successful for a number of reasons a liquid market may not exist and thus a fund may not be able to close out an option position that it has previously entered into when a fund purchases an otc option as defined below it will be relying on its counterparty to perform its obligations and the fund may incur additional losses if the counterparty is unable to perform exchangetraded and otc options all options purchased or sold by a fund will be traded on a securities exchange or will be purchased or sold by securities dealers “otc options” that meet the fund’s creditworthiness standards while exchangetraded options are obligations of the options clearing corporation in the case of otc options a fund relies on the dealer from which it purchased the option to perform if the option is exercised thus when a fund purchases an otc option it relies on the dealer from which it purchased the option to make or take delivery of the underlying securities failure by the dealer to do so would result in the loss of the premium paid by a fund as well as loss of the expected benefit of the transaction provided that a fund has arrangements with certain qualified dealers who agree that a fund may repurchase any option it writes for a maximum price to be calculated by a predetermined formula a fund may treat the underlying securities used to cover written otc options as liquid in these cases the otc option itself would only   part ii   be considered illiquid to the extent that the maximum repurchase price under the formula exceeds the intrinsic value of the option futures contracts when a fund purchases a futures contract it agrees to purchase a specified quantity of an underlying instrument at a specified future date or in the case of an index futures contract to make a cash payment based on the value of a securities index when a fund sells a futures contract it agrees to sell a specified quantity of the underlying instrument at a specified future date or in the case of an index futures contract to receive a cash payment based on the value of a securities index the price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when a fund enters into the contract futures can be held until their delivery dates or the position can be and normally is closed out before then there is no assurance however that a liquid market will exist when the fund wishes to close out a particular position when a fund purchases a futures contract the value of the futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument therefore purchasing futures contracts will tend to increase a fund’s exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument much as if it had purchased the underlying instrument directly when a fund sells a futures contract by contrast the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction contrary to the value of the underlying instrument selling futures contracts therefore will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes much as if the underlying instrument had been sold the purchaser or seller of a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the contract is held until the delivery date however when a fund buys or sells a futures contract it will be required to deposit “initial margin” with a futures commission merchant “fcm” initial margin deposits are typically equal to a small percentage of the contract’s value if the value of either party’s position declines that party will be required to make additional “variation margin” payments equal to the change in value on a daily basis the party that has a gain may be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount a fund may be obligated to make payments of variation margin at a time when it is disadvantageous to do so furthermore it may not always be possible for a fund to close out its futures positions until it closes out a futures position a fund will be obligated to continue to pay variation margin initial and variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing on margin for purposes of a fund’s investment restrictions in the event of the bankruptcy of an fcm that holds margin on behalf of a fund the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the fcm’s other customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund for cashsettled futures the fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets in an amount equal to the marktomarket value for physically settled futures the fund will earmark or segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to the notional value in calculating the segregation amount netting of similar contracts is generally permitted such assets cannot be sold while the futures contract or option is outstanding unless they are replaced with other suitable assets by setting aside assets equal only to its net obligation under cashsettled futures a fund will have the ability to have exposure to such instruments to a greater extent than if a fund were required to set aside assets equal to the full notional value of such contracts there is a possibility that earmarking and reservation of a large percentage of a fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or a fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations the funds only invest in futures contracts on securities to the extent they could invest in the underlying securities directly certain funds may also invest in index futures where the underlying securities or instruments are not available for direct investments by the funds cash equitization the objective where equity futures are used to “equitize” cash is to match the notional value of all futures contracts to a fund’s cash balance the notional values of the futures contracts and of the cash are monitored daily as the cash is invested in securities andor paid out to participants in redemptions the adviser simultaneously adjusts the futures positions through such procedures a fund not only gains equity exposure from the use of futures but also benefits from increased flexibility in responding to client cash flow needs additionally because it can be less expensive to trade a list of securities as a package or program trade rather than as a group of individual orders futures provide a means through which transaction costs can be reduced such nonhedging risk management techniques involve leverage and thus present as do all leveraged transactions the possibility of losses as well as gains that are greater than if these techniques involved the purchase and sale of the securities themselves rather than their synthetic derivatives options on futures contracts futures contracts obligate the buyer to take and the seller to make delivery at a future date of a specified quantity of a financial instrument or an amount of cash based on the value of a securities or other index currently futures contracts are available on various types of securities including but not limited to us treasury bonds notes and bills eurodollar certificates of deposit and on indexes of securities unlike a futures   part ii   contract which requires the parties to buy and sell a security or make a cash settlement payment based on changes in a financial instrument or securities or other index on an agreed date an option on a futures contract entitles its holder to decide on or before a future date whether to enter into such a contract if the holder decides not to exercise its option the holder may close out the option position by entering into an offsetting transaction or may decide to let the option expire and forfeit the premium thereon the purchaser of an option on a futures contract pays a premium for the option but makes no initial margin payments or daily payments of cash in the nature of “variation margin” payments to reflect the change in the value of the underlying contract as does a purchaser or seller of a futures contract the seller of an option on a futures contract receives the premium paid by the purchaser and may be required to pay initial margin for physically settled options on futures the funds will earmark or segregate an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the underlying future for cashsettled options on futures the fund will earmark or segregate an amount of liquid assets equal to the market value of the obligation market value is equal to the intrinsic value which is calculated by taking the number of contracts times a multiplier times the difference between the strike and current market price combined positions certain funds may purchase and write options in combination with futures or forward contracts to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position for example a fund may purchase a put option and write a call option on the same underlying instrument in order to construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract another possible combined position would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price in order to reduce the risk of the written call option in the event of a substantial price increase because combined options positions involve multiple trades they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out correlation of price changes because there are a limited number of types of exchangetraded options and futures contracts it is likely that the standardized options and futures contracts available will not match a fund’s current or anticipated investments exactly a fund may invest in futures and options contracts based on securities or instruments with different issuers maturities or other characteristics from the securities in which it typically invests which involves a risk that the options or futures position will not track the performance of a fund’s other investments options and futures contracts prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments even if the underlying instruments match the fund’s investments well options and futures contracts prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated short term interest rates changes in volatility of the underlying instrument and the time remaining until expiration of the contract which may not affect security prices the same way imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options and futures markets and the securities markets from structural differences in how options and futures and securities are traded or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts a fund may purchase or sell options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities although this may not be successful in all cases if price changes in a fund’s options or futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments liquidity of options and futures contracts there is no assurance that a liquid market will exist for any particular option or futures contract at any particular time even if the contract is traded on an exchange in addition exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for options and futures contracts and may halt trading if a contract’s price moves up or down more than the limit in a given day on volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed it may be impossible for a fund to enter into new positions or close out existing positions if the market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions and could potentially require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value as a result a fund’s access to other assets held to cover its options or futures positions could also be impaired see “exchangetraded and otc options” above for a discussion of the liquidity of options not traded on an exchange foreign investment risk certain funds may buy and sell options on interest rate futures including global interest rate futures in which the reference interest rate is tied to currencies other than the us dollar such investments are subject to additional risks including the risks associated with foreign investment and currency risk see “foreign investments including foreign currencies” in this sai part ii position limits futures exchanges can limit the number of futures and options on futures contracts that can be held or controlled by an entity if an adequate exemption cannot be obtained a fund or the fund’s adviser may be   part ii   required to reduce the size of its futures and options positions or may not be able to trade a certain futures or options contract in order to avoid exceeding such limits asset coverage for futures contracts and options positions a fund will comply with guidelines established by the sec with respect to coverage of options and futures contracts by mutual funds and if the guidelines so require will set aside or earmark appropriate liquid assets in the amount prescribed such assets cannot be sold while the futures contract or option is outstanding unless they are replaced with other suitable assets as a result there is a possibility that the reservation of a large percentage of a fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or a fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations real estate investment trusts “reits” certain of the funds may invest in equity interests or debt obligations issued by reits reits are pooled investment vehicles which invest primarily in income producing real estate or real estate related loans or interest reits are generally classified as equity reits mortgage reits or a combination of equity and mortgage reits equity reits invest the majority of their assets directly in real property and derive income primarily from the collection of rents equity reits can also realize capital gains by selling property that has appreciated in value mortgage reits invest the majority of their assets in real estate mortgages and derive income from the collection of interest payments similar to investment companies reits are not taxed on income distributed to shareholders provided they comply with several requirements of the code a fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of expenses incurred by reits in which a fund invests in addition to the expenses incurred directly by a fund investing in reits involves certain unique risks in addition to those risks associated with investing in the real estate industry in general equity reits may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the reits while mortgage reits may be affected by the quality of any credit extended reits are dependent upon management skills and on cash flows are not diversified and are subject to default by borrowers and selfliquidation reits are also subject to the possibilities of failing to qualify for tax free passthrough of income under the code and failing to maintain their exemption from registration under the  act reits especially mortgage reits are also subject to interest rate risks when interest rates decline the value of a reit’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise conversely when interest rates rise the value of a reit’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to decline in contrast as interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans are reset periodically yields on a reit’s investment in such loans will gradually align themselves to fluctuate less dramatically in response to interest rate fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations investment in reits involves risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies these risks include     •   limited financial resources     •   infrequent or limited trading and     •   more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities in addition small capitalization stocks such as certain reits historically have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the sp  index recent events relating to the overall economy the us government the federal reserve the treasury the sec the federal deposit insurance corporation and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken actions to address the financial crisis these actions included in part the enactment by the united states congress of the “doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” which was signed into law on july   and imposed a new regulatory framework over the us financial services industry and the consumer credit markets in general and proposed and final regulations by the sec given the broad scope sweeping nature and relatively recent enactment of some of these regulatory measures the potential impact they could have on securities held by the funds is unknown there can be no assurance that these measures will not have an adverse effect on the value or marketability of securities held by the funds furthermore no assurance can be made that the us government or any us regulatory body or other authority or regulatory body will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action and the effect of such actions if taken cannot be known   part ii   repurchase agreements repurchase agreements may be entered into with brokers dealers or banks or other entities that meet the adviser’s credit guidelines a fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with member banks of the federal reserve system and securities dealers or other entities believed by the adviser to be creditworthy the adviser may consider the collateral received and any applicable guarantees in making its determination in a repurchase agreement a fund buys a security from a seller that has agreed to repurchase the same security at a mutually agreed upon date and price the resale price normally is in excess of the purchase price reflecting an agreed upon interest rate this interest rate is effective for the period of time a fund is invested in the agreement and is not related to the coupon rate on the underlying security a repurchase agreement may also be viewed as a fully collateralized loan of money by a fund to the seller the maximum maturity permitted for a non“putable” repurchase agreement will be i  days for a money market fund for certain counterparties and  days for others and ii  days for any fund that is not a money market fund the maximum notice period permitted for a “putable” repurchase agreement ie where the fund has a right to put the repurchase agreement to the counterparty at par plus accrued interest at a specified notice period will be i  days for a money market fund for certain counterparties and  days for others and ii  days for any fund that is not a money market fund the securities which are subject to repurchase agreements however may have maturity dates in excess of  days from the effective date of the repurchase agreement in addition the maturity of a “putable” repurchase agreement may be in excess of  days repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days or where the put right requires greater than seven days’ notice are treated as illiquid for purposes of a fund’s restrictions on purchases of illiquid securities a fund will always receive securities as collateral during the term of the agreement whose market value is at least equal to  of the dollar amount invested by the fund in each agreement plus accrued interest the repurchase agreements further authorize the fund to demand additional collateral in the event that the dollar value of the collateral falls below  a fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian repurchase agreements are considered under the  act to be loans collateralized by the underlying securities all of the funds that are permitted to invest in repurchase agreements may engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized fully as defined in rule bc of the  act except that rule bcivc under the  act shall not apply for the money market funds which has the effect of enabling a fund to look to the collateral rather than the counterparty for determining whether its assets are “diversified” for  act purposes with respect to the money market funds in accordance with rule a under the  act the adviser evaluates the creditworthiness of each counterparty the adviser may consider the collateral received and any applicable guarantees in making its determination certain funds may in addition engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized by money market instruments debt securities loan participations equity securities or other securities including securities that are rated below investment grade by the requisite nrsros or unrated securities of comparable quality for these types of repurchase agreement transactions the fund would look to the counterparty and not the collateral for determining such diversification a repurchase agreement is subject to the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the security in the event of default by the seller under a repurchase agreement construed to be a collateralized loan the underlying securities would not be owned by the fund but would only constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price therefore a fund may suffer time delays and incur costs in connection with the disposition of the collateral the collateral underlying repurchase agreements may be more susceptible to claims of the seller’s creditors than would be the case with securities owned by the fund under existing guidance from the sec certain funds may transfer uninvested cash balances into a joint account along with cash of other funds and certain other accounts these balances may be invested in one or more repurchase agreements andor shortterm money market instruments reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security and agrees to repurchase the same security at a mutually agreed upon date and price reflecting the interest rate effective for the term of the agreement for purposes of the  act a reverse repurchase agreement is considered borrowing by a fund and therefore a form of leverage leverage may cause any gains or losses for a fund to be magnified the funds will invest the proceeds of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements in addition except for liquidity purposes a fund will enter into a reverse repurchase agreement only when the expected return from the investment of the proceeds is greater than the   part ii   expense of the transaction a fund will not invest the proceeds of a reverse repurchase agreement for a period which exceeds the duration of the reverse repurchase agreement a fund would be required to pay interest on amounts obtained through reverse repurchase agreements which are considered borrowings under federal securities laws the repurchase price is generally equal to the original sales price plus interest reverse repurchase agreements are usually for seven days or less and cannot be repaid prior to their expiration dates each fund will earmark and reserve fund assets in cash or liquid securities in an amount at least equal to its purchase obligations under its reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the portfolio securities transferred may decline below the price at which a fund is obliged to purchase the securities all forms of borrowing including reverse repurchase agreements are limited in the aggregate and may not exceed   of a fund’s total assets except as permitted by law securities lending to generate additional income certain funds may lend up to   of such fund’s total assets pursuant to agreements requiring that the loan be continuously secured by collateral equal to at least  of the market value plus accrued interest on the securities lent certain funds generally some of the funds with an investment strategy of investing primarily in us equity securities use goldman sachs bank usa formerly known as the goldman sachs trust company doing business as goldman sachs agency lending “goldman sachs” as their securities lending agent pursuant to an agreement among goldman sachs jpmorgan chase bank and certain funds the “third party securities lending agreement” approved by the board of trustees goldman sachs compensates jpmorgan chase bank for certain operational services which may include processing transactions termination of loans and recordkeeping provided by jpmorgan chase bank the other funds that engage in securities lending use jpmorgan chase bank as their securities lending agent pursuant to a securities lending agreement approved by the board of trustees between goldman sachs and the trusts on behalf of certain jp morgan us equity funds the “goldman sachs agreement” collateral for loans will consist only of cash pursuant to a securities lending agreement approved by the board of trustees between jpmorgan chase bank and certain funds the “jpmorgan agreement” collateral for loans will consist of cash the funds receive payments from the borrowers equivalent to the dividends and interest that would have been earned on the securities lent for loans secured by cash the funds seek to earn interest on the investment of cash collateral in investments permitted by the applicable securities lending agreement under both the goldman sachs agreement and the jpmorgan agreement cash collateral may be invested in capital shares of the prime money market fund under the jpmorgan agreement jpmorgan chase bank performs a daily mark to market of the loaned security and requests additional cash collateral if the amount of cash received from the borrower is less than  of the value of the loaned security in the case of securities denominated in us dollars and  of the value of the loaned security in the case of securities denominated in nonus dollars subject to certain de minimis guidelines such de minimis guidelines provide that for a loan of us dollar denominated securities the aggregate value of cash collateral for such loan may be less than  but in no event less than  and for a loan of nonus dollar denominated securities the aggregate value of cash collateral held for such loan may be less than  but in no event less than  under the goldman sachs agreement goldman sachs marks to market the loaned securities on a daily basis in the event the cash received from the borrower is less than  of the value of the loaned securities goldman sachs requests additional cash from the borrower so as to maintain a collateralization level of at least  of the value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest loans are subject to termination by a fund or the borrower at any time and are therefore not considered to be illiquid investments a fund does not have the right to vote proxies for securities on loan however a fund’s adviser may terminate a loan if the vote is considered material with respect to an investment securities lending involves counterparty risk including the risk that the loaned securities may not be returned or returned in a timely manner andor a loss of rights in the collateral if the borrower or the lending agent defaults or fails financially this risk is increased when a fund’s loans are concentrated with a single or limited number of borrowers the earnings on the collateral invested may not be sufficient to pay fees incurred in connection with the loan also the principal value of the collateral invested may decline and may not be sufficient to pay back the borrower for the amount of collateral posted there are no limits on the number of borrowers a fund may use and a fund may lend securities to only one or a small group of borrowers in addition under the goldman sachs agreement loans may be made to affiliates of goldman sachs as identified in the goldman sachs agreement funds participating in securities lending bear the risk of loss in connection with investments of the cash collateral received from the borrowers which do not trigger additional collateral requirements from the borrower   part ii   to the extent that the value or return of a fund’s investments of the cash collateral declines below the amount owed to a borrower the fund may incur losses that exceed the amount it earned on lending the security in situations where the adviser does not believe that it is prudent to sell the cash collateral investments in the market a fund may borrow money to repay the borrower the amount of cash collateral owed to the borrower upon return of the loaned securities this will result in financial leverage which may cause the fund to be more volatile because financial leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities short selling in short selling transactions a fund sells a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline in the market value of the security to complete the transaction a fund must borrow the security to make delivery to the buyer a fund is obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing it subsequently at the market price at the time of replacement the price at such time may be more or less than the price at which the security was sold by a fund which may result in a loss or gain respectively unlike taking a long position in a security by purchasing the security where potential losses are limited to the purchase price short sales have no cap on maximum losses and gains are limited to the price of the security at the time of the short sale short sales of forward commitments and derivatives do not involve borrowing a security these types of short sales may include futures options contracts for differences forward contracts on financial instruments and options such as contracts credit linked instruments and swap contracts a fund may not always be able to borrow a security it wants to sell short a fund also may be unable to close out an established short position at an acceptable price and may have to sell long positions at disadvantageous times to cover its short positions the value of your investment in a fund will fluctuate in response to movements in the market fund performance also will depend on the effectiveness of the adviser’s research and the management team’s investment decisions the sec and financial industry regulatory authorities in other countries may impose prohibitions restrictions or other regulatory requirements on short sales which could inhibit the ability of the adviser to sell securities short on behalf of the fund for example in september  in response to spreading turmoil in the financial markets the sec temporarily banned short selling in the stocks of numerous financial services companies and also promulgated new disclosure requirements with respect to short positions held by investment managers the sec’s temporary ban on short selling of such stocks has since expired but should similar restrictions andor additional disclosure requirements be promulgated especially if market turmoil occurs a fund may be forced to cover short positions more quickly than otherwise intended and may suffer losses as a result such restrictions may also adversely affect the ability of a fund especially if a fund utilizes short selling as a significant portion of its investment strategy to execute its investment strategies generally short sales also involve other costs a fund must repay to the lender an amount equal to any dividends or interest that accrues while the loan is outstanding to borrow the security a fund may be required to pay a premium a fund also will incur transaction costs in effecting short sales the amount of any ultimate gain for a fund resulting from a short sale will be decreased and the amount of any ultimate loss will be increased by the amount of premiums interest or expenses a fund may be required to pay in connection with the short sale until a fund closes the short position it will earmark and reserve fund assets in cash or liquid securities to offset a portion of the leverage risk realized gains from short sales are typically treated as shortterm gainslosses certain of a fund’s service providers may have agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses to limit the fund’s operating expenses in the amount and for the time period specified in the fund’s prospectuses the expense limitation does not include certain expenses including to the extent indicated in the fund’s prospectuses dividend and interest expense on short sales in calculating the interest expense on short sales for purposes of this exclusion the fund will recognize all economic elements of interest costs including premium and discount adjustments shortterm funding agreements shortterm funding agreements issued by insurance companies are sometimes referred to as guaranteed investment contracts “gics” while those issued by banks are referred to as bank investment contracts “bics” pursuant to such agreements a fund makes cash contributions to a deposit account at a bank or insurance company the bank or insurance company then credits to the fund on a monthly basis guaranteed interest at either a fixed variable or floating rate these contracts are general obligations of the issuing bank or insurance company although they may be the obligations of an insurance company separate account and are paid from the general assets of the issuing entity   part ii   a fund will purchase shortterm funding agreements only from banks and insurance companies which at the time of purchase are rated in one of the three highest rating categories and have assets of  billion or more generally there is no active secondary market in shortterm funding agreements therefore shortterm funding agreements may be considered by a fund to be illiquid investments to the extent that a shortterm funding agreement is determined to be illiquid such agreements will be acquired by a fund only if at the time of purchase no more than  of the fund’s net assets  of the total assets for the money market funds will be invested in shortterm funding agreements and other illiquid securities special purpose acquisition companies the funds may invest in stock warrants and other securities of special purpose acquisition companies “spacs” or similar special purpose entities that pool funds to seek potential acquisition opportunities unless and until an acquisition is completed a spac generally invests its assets less a portion retained to cover expenses in us government securities money market fund securities and cash to the extent the spac is invested in cash or similar securities this may impact a fund’s ability to meet its investment objective if an acquisition that meets the requirements for the spac is not completed within a preestablished period of time the invested funds are returned to the entity’s shareholders less certain permitted expense and any warrants issued by the spac will expire worthless because spacs and similar entities are in essence blank check companies without an operating history or ongoing business other than seeking acquisitions the value of their securities is particularly dependent on the ability of the entity’s management to identify and complete a profitable acquisition spacs may pursue acquisitions only within certain industries or regions which may increase the volatility of their prices in addition these securities which are typically traded in the overthecounter market may be considered illiquid andor be subject to restrictions on resale structured investments a structured investment is a security having a return tied to an underlying index or other security or asset class structured investments generally are individually negotiated agreements and may be traded overthecounter structured investments are organized and operated to restructure the investment characteristics of the underlying security this restructuring involves the deposit with or purchase by an entity such as a corporation or trust or specified instruments such as commercial bank loans and the issuance by that entity or one or more classes of securities “structured securities” backed by or representing interests in the underlying instruments the cash flow on the underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured securities to create securities with different investment characteristics such as varying maturities payment priorities and interest rate provisions and the extent of such payments made with respect to structured securities is dependent on the extent of the cash flow on the underlying instruments because structured securities typically involve no credit enhancement their credit risk generally will be equivalent to that of the underlying instruments investments in structured securities are generally of a class of structured securities that is either subordinated or unsubordinated to the right of payment of another class subordinated structured securities typically have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated structured securities structured instruments include structured notes in addition to the risks applicable to investments in structured investments and debt securities in general structured notes bear the risk that the issuer may not be required to pay interest on the structured note if the index rate rises above or falls below a certain level structured securities are typically sold in private placement transactions and there currently is no active trading market for structured securities investments in government and governmentrelated restructured debt instruments are subject to special risks including the inability or unwillingness to repay principal and interest requests to reschedule or restructure outstanding debt and requests to extend additional loan amounts structured investments include a wide variety of instruments including without limitation collateralized debt obligations credit linked notes and participation notes and participatory notes structured instruments that are registered under the federal securities laws may be treated as liquid in addition many structured instruments may not be registered under the federal securities laws in that event a fund’s ability to resell such a structured instrument may be more limited than its ability to resell other fund securities the funds will treat such instruments as illiquid and will limit their investments in such instruments to no more than  of each fund’s net assets  of the total assets for the money market funds when combined with all other illiquid investments of each fund total annual fund operating expenses set forth in the fee table and financial highlights section of each fund’s prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain structured or synthetic   part ii   products that may rely on the exception for the definition of “investment company” provided by section c or c of the  act credit linked notes certain funds may invest in structured instruments known as credit linked securities or credit linked notes “clns” clns are typically issued by a limited purpose trust or other vehicle the “cln trust” that in turn invests in a derivative or basket of derivatives instruments such as credit default swaps interest rate swaps andor other securities in order to provide exposure to certain high yield sovereign debt emerging markets or other fixed income markets generally investments in clns represent the right to receive periodic income payments in the form of distributions and payment of principal at the end of the term of the cln however these payments are conditioned on the cln trust’s receipt of payments from and the cln trust’s potential obligations to the counterparties to the derivative instruments and other securities in which the cln trust invests for example the cln trust may sell one or more credit default swaps under which the cln trust would receive a stream of payments over the term of the swap agreements provided that no event of default has occurred with respect to the referenced debt obligation upon which the swap is based if a default were to occur the stream of payments may stop and the cln trust would be obligated to pay the counterparty the par or other agreed upon value of the referenced debt obligation this in turn would reduce the amount of income and principal that a fund would receive as an investor in the cln trust certain funds may enter into clns structured as “firsttodefault” clns in a firsttodefault cln the cln trust enters into a credit default swap on a portfolio of a specified number of individual securities pursuant to which the cln trust sells protection to a counterparty the cln trust uses the proceeds of issuing investments in the cln trust to purchase securities which are selected by the counterparty and the total return of which is paid to the counterparty upon the occurrence of a default or credit event involving any one of the individual securities the credit default swaps terminate and the fund’s investment in the cln trust is redeemed for an amount equal to “par” minus the amount paid to the counterparty under the credit default swap certain funds may also enter in clns to gain access to sovereign debt and securities in emerging market particularly in markets where the fund is not able to purchase securities directly due to domicile restrictions or tax restrictions or tariffs in such an instance the issuer of the cln may purchase the reference security directly andor gain exposure through a credit default swap or other derivative a fund’s investments in clns is subject to the risks associated with the underlying reference obligations and derivative instruments including among others credit risk default or similar event risk counterparty risk interest rate risk leverage risk and management risk participation notes and participatory notes certain funds may invest in instruments that have similar economic characteristics to equity securities such as participation notes also known as participatory notes “pnotes” or other structured instruments that may be developed from time to time “structured instruments” structured instruments are notes that are issued by banks brokerdealers or their affiliates and are designed to offer a return linked to a particular underlying equity or market if the structured instrument were held to maturity the issuer would pay to the purchaser the underlying instrument’s value at maturity with any necessary adjustments the holder of a structured instrument that is linked to a particular underlying security or instrument may be entitled to receive dividends paid in connection with that underlying security or instrument but typically does not receive voting rights as it would if it directly owned the underlying security or instrument structured instruments have transaction costs in addition there can be no assurance that there will be a trading market for a structured instrument or that the trading price of a structured instrument will equal the underlying value of the security instrument or market that it seeks to replicate unlike a direct investment in equity securities structured instruments typically involve a term or expiration date potentially increasing the fund’s turnover rate transaction costs and tax liability due to transfer restrictions the secondary markets on which a structured instrument is traded may be less liquid than the market for other securities or may be completely illiquid which may expose the fund to risks of mispricing or improper valuation structured instruments typically constitute general unsecured contractual obligations of the banks brokerdealers or their relevant affiliates that issue them which subjects the fund to counterparty risk and this risk may be amplified if the fund purchases structured instruments from only a small number of issuers structured instruments also have the same risks associated with a direct investment in the underlying securities instruments or markets that they seek to replicate   part ii   swaps and related swap products swap transactions may include but are not limited to interest rate swaps currency swaps crosscurrency interest rate swaps forward rate agreements contracts for differences total return swaps index swaps basket swaps specific security swaps fixed income sectors swaps commodity swaps assetbacked swaps abx commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs and indexes of cmbs cmbx credit default swaps interest rate caps price lock swaps floors and collars and swaptions collectively defined as “swap transactions” a fund may enter into swap transactions for any legal purpose consistent with its investment objective and policies such as for the purpose of attempting to obtain or preserve a particular return or spread at a lower cost than obtaining that return or spread through purchases andor sales of instruments in cash markets to protect against currency fluctuations to protect against any increase in the price of securities a fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to gain exposure to certain markets in the most economical way possible swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional counterparties for periods ranging from a few weeks to several years in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return that would be earned or realized on specified notional investments or instruments the gross returns to be exchanged or “swapped” between the parties are calculated by reference to a “notional amount” ie the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or commodity or in a “basket” of securities representing a particular index the purchaser of an interest rate cap or floor upon payment of a fee has the right to receive payments and the seller of the cap or floor is obligated to make payments to the extent a specified interest rate exceeds in the case of a cap or is less than in the case of a floor a specified level over a specified period of time or at specified dates the purchaser of an interest rate collar upon payment of a fee has the right to receive payments and the seller of the collar is obligated to make payments to the extent that a specified interest rate falls outside an agreed upon range over a specified period of time or at specified dates the purchaser of an option on an interest rate swap also known as a “swaption” upon payment of a fee either at the time of purchase or in the form of higher payments or lower receipts within an interest rate swap transaction has the right but not the obligation to initiate a new swap transaction of a prespecified notional amount with prespecified terms with the seller of the swaption as the counterparty the “notional amount” of a swap transaction is the agreed upon basis for calculating the payments that the parties have agreed to exchange for example one swap counterparty may agree to pay a floating rate of interest eg  month libor calculated based on a  million notional amount on a quarterly basis in exchange for receipt of payments calculated based on the same notional amount and a fixed rate of interest on a semiannual basis in the event a fund is obligated to make payments more frequently than it receives payments from the other party it will incur incremental credit exposure to that swap counterparty this risk may be mitigated somewhat by the use of swap agreements which call for a net payment to be made by the party with the larger payment obligation when the obligations of the parties fall due on the same date under most swap agreements entered into by a fund payments by the parties will be exchanged on a “net basis” and a fund will receive or pay as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments the amount of a fund’s potential gain or loss on any swap transaction is not subject to any fixed limit nor is there any fixed limit on a fund’s potential loss if it sells a cap or collar if a fund buys a cap floor or collar however the fund’s potential loss is limited to the amount of the fee that it has paid when measured against the initial amount of cash required to initiate the transaction which is typically zero in the case of most conventional swap transactions swaps caps floors and collars tend to be more volatile than many other types of instruments the use of swap transactions caps floors and collars involves investment techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions if a fund’s adviser is incorrect in its forecasts of market values interest rates and other applicable factors the investment performance of the fund will be less favorable than if these techniques had not been used these instruments are typically not traded on exchanges accordingly there is a risk that the other party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to a fund or that a fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so such occurrences could result in losses to a fund a fund’s adviser will consider such risks and will enter into swap and other derivatives transactions only when it believes that the risks are not unreasonable a fund will earmark and reserve fund assets in cash or liquid securities in an amount sufficient at all times to cover its current obligations under its swap transactions caps floors and collars if a fund enters into a swap   part ii   agreement on a net basis it will earmark and reserve assets with a daily value at least equal to the excess if any of a fund’s accrued obligations under the swap agreement over the accrued amount a fund is entitled to receive under the agreement if a fund enters into a swap agreement on other than a net basis or sells a cap floor or collar it will earmark and reserve assets with a daily value at least equal to the full amount of a fund’s accrued obligations under the agreement a fund will not enter into any swap transaction cap floor or collar unless the counterparty to the transaction is deemed creditworthy by the fund’s adviser if a counterparty defaults a fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction the swap markets in which many types of swap transactions are traded have grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the markets for certain types of swaps eg interest rate swaps have become relatively liquid the markets for some types of caps floors and collars are less liquid the liquidity of swap transactions caps floors and collars will be as set forth in guidelines established by a fund’s adviser and approved by the trustees which are based on various factors including  the availability of dealer quotations and the estimated transaction volume for the instrument  the number of dealers and end users for the instrument in the marketplace  the level of market making by dealers in the type of instrument  the nature of the instrument including any right of a party to terminate it on demand and  the nature of the marketplace for trades including the ability to assign or offset a fund’s rights and obligations relating to the instrument such determination will govern whether the instrument will be deemed within the applicable liquidity restriction on investments in securities that are not readily marketable during the term of a swap cap floor or collar changes in the value of the instrument are recognized as unrealized gains or losses by marking to market to reflect the market value of the instrument when the instrument is terminated a fund will record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference if any between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transaction and a fund’s basis in the contract the federal income tax treatment with respect to swap transactions caps floors and collars may impose limitations on the extent to which a fund may engage in such transactions credit default swaps as described above swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year in the case of a credit default swap “cds” the contract gives one party the buyer the right to recoup the economic value of a decline in the value of debt securities of the reference issuer if the credit event a downgrade or default occurs this value is obtained by delivering a debt security of the reference issuer to the party in return for a previously agreed payment from the other party frequently the par value of the debt security cds include credit default swaps which are contracts on individual securities and cdx which are contracts on baskets or indices of securities credit default swaps may require initial premium discount payments as well as periodic payments receipts related to the interest leg of the swap or to the default of a reference obligation in cases where a fund is a seller of a cds contract including a cdx contract the fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets equal the notional amount of the contract furthermore a fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets to cover any accrued payment obligations when it is the buyer of a cds including cdx in calculating the amount to be segregated for this purpose the fund is not considered to have an accrued payment obligation when it is the buyer of a cds including a cdx when the contract is in a gain position as no additional amounts are owed to the counterparty in cases where a fund is a buyer of a cds contract including a cdx contract the fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the marktomarket value when the contract is in a loss position if a fund is a seller of protection under a cds contract the fund would be required to pay the par or other agreed upon value of a referenced debt obligation to the counterparty in the event of a default or other credit event by the reference issuer such as a us or foreign corporate issuer with respect to such debt obligations in return a fund would receive from the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred if no default occurs a fund would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment obligations as the seller a fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap if a fund is a buyer of protection under a cds contract the fund would have the right to deliver a referenced debt obligation and receive the par or other agreedupon value of such debt obligation from the counterparty in the event of a default or other credit event such as a downgrade in credit rating by the reference issuer such as a us or foreign corporation with respect to its debt obligations in return the fund would pay the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred if no default occurs the counterparty would keep the stream of payments and would have no further obligations to the fund   part ii   the use of cdss like all swap agreements is subject to certain risks if a counterparty’s creditworthiness declines the value of the swap would likely decline moreover there is no guarantee that a fund could eliminate its exposure under an outstanding swap agreement by entering into an offsetting swap agreement with the same or another party in addition to general market risks cdss involve liquidity credit and counterparty risks the recent increase in corporate defaults further raises these liquidity and credit risks increasing the possibility that sellers will not have sufficient funds to make payments as unregulated instruments cdss are difficult to value and are therefore susceptible to liquidity and credit risks counterparty risks also stem from the lack of regulation of cdss collateral posting requirements are individually negotiated between counterparties and there is no regulatory requirement concerning the amount of collateral that a counterparty must post to secure its obligations under a cds because they are unregulated there is no requirement that parties to a contract be informed in advance when a cds is sold as a result investors may have difficulty identifying the party responsible for payment of their claims if a counterparty’s credit becomes significantly impaired multiple requests for collateral posting in a short period of time could increase the risk that the fund may not receive adequate collateral there is no readily available market for trading out of cds contracts in order to eliminate a position it has taken in a cds the fund must terminate the existing cds contract or enter into an offsetting trade the fund may only exit its obligations under a cds contract by terminating the contract and paying applicable breakage fees which could result in additional losses to the fund furthermore the cost of entering into an offsetting cds position could cause the fund to incur losses synthetic variable rate instruments synthetic variable rate instruments generally involve the deposit of a longterm tax exempt bond in a custody or trust arrangement and the creation of a mechanism to adjust the longterm interest rate on the bond to a variable shortterm rate and a right subject to certain conditions on the part of the purchaser to tender it periodically to a third party at par a fund’s adviser reviews the structure of synthetic variable rate instruments to identify credit and liquidity risks including the conditions under which the right to tender the instrument would no longer be available and will monitor those risks in the event that the right to tender the instrument is no longer available the risk to the fund will be that of holding the longterm bond in the case of some types of instruments credit enhancement is not provided and if certain events occur which may include a default in the payment of principal or interest on the underlying bond b downgrading of the bond below investment grade or c a loss of the bond’s tax exempt status then the put will terminate and the risk to the fund will be that of holding a longterm bond total annual fund operating expenses set forth in the fee table and financial highlights section of each fund’s prospectuses do not include any expenses associated with investments in certain structured or synthetic products that may rely on the exception for the definition of “investment company” provided by section c or c of the  act treasury receipts a fund may purchase interests in separately traded interest and principal component parts of us treasury obligations that are issued by banks or brokerage firms and are created by depositing us treasury notes and us treasury bonds into a special account at a custodian bank receipts include treasury receipts “trs” treasury investment growth receipts “tigrs” and certificates of accrual on treasury securities “cats” receipts in which an entity other than the government separates the interest and principal components are not considered government securities unless such securities are issued through the treasury separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities “strips” program trust preferred securities certain funds may purchase trust preferred securities also known as “trust preferreds” which are preferred stocks issued by a special purpose trust subsidiary backed by subordinated debt of the corporate parent an issuer creates trust preferred securities by creating a trust and issuing debt to the trust the trust in turn issues trust preferred securities trust preferred securities are hybrid securities with characteristics of both subordinated debt and preferred stock such characteristics include long maturities typically  years or more early redemption by the issuer periodic fixed or variable interest payments and maturities at face value in addition trust preferred securities issued by a bank holding company may allow deferral of interest payments for up to  years holders of trust preferred securities have limited voting rights to control the activities of the trust and no voting rights with respect to the parent company   part ii   us government obligations us government obligations may include direct obligations of the us treasury including treasury bills notes and bonds all of which are backed as to principal and interest payments by the full faith and credit of the us and separately traded principal and interest component parts of such obligations that are transferable through the federal bookentry system known as strips and coupon under book entry safekeeping “cubes” the funds may also invest in tips us government obligations are subject to market risk interest rate risk and credit risk the principal and interest components of us treasury bonds with remaining maturities of longer than ten years are eligible to be traded independently under the strips program under the strips program the principal and interest components are separately issued by the us treasury at the request of depository financial institutions which then trade the component parts separately the interest component of strips may be more volatile than that of us treasury bills with comparable maturities other obligations include those issued or guaranteed by us government agencies gses or instrumentalities these obligations may or may not be backed by the “full faith and credit” of the us securities which are backed by the full faith and credit of the us include obligations of the government national mortgage association the farmers home administration and the exportimport bank in the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the us the funds must look principally to the federal agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the us itself in the event the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitments securities in which the funds may invest that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us include but are not limited to i obligations of the tennessee valley authority the federal home loan banks and the us postal service each of which has the right to borrow from the us treasury to meet its obligations ii securities issued by freddie mac and fannie mae which are supported only by the credit of such securities but for which the secretary of the treasury has discretionary authority to purchase limited amounts of the agency’s obligations and iii obligations of the federal farm credit system and the student loan marketing association each of whose obligations may be satisfied only by the individual credits of the issuing agency the total public debt of the united states and other countries around the globe as a percent of gross domestic product has grown rapidly since the beginning of the  financial downturn although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems they may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented a high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs which may drive debt cost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt thereby increasing refinancing risk a high national debt also raises concerns that a government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due unsustainable debt levels can cause devaluations of currency prevent a government from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns and contribute to market volatility in the past us sovereign credit has experienced downgrades and there can be no guarantee that it will not experience further downgrades in the future by rating agencies the market prices and yields of securities supported by the full faith and credit of the us government may be adversely affected by a rating agency’s decision to downgrade the sovereign credit rating of the united states whenissued securities delayed delivery securities and forward commitments securities may be purchased on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis for example delivery of and payment for these securities can take place a month or more after the date of the purchase commitment the purchase price and the interest rate payable if any on the securities are fixed on the purchase commitment date or at the time the settlement date is fixed the value of such securities is subject to market fluctuation and for money market instruments and other fixed income securities no interest accrues to a fund until settlement takes place at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis it will record the transaction reflect the value each day of such securities in determining its nav and if applicable calculate the maturity for the purposes of average maturity from that date at the time of settlement a whenissued security may be valued at less than the purchase price to facilitate such acquisitions each fund will earmark and reserve fund assets in cash or liquid securities in an amount at least equal to such commitments on delivery dates for such transactions each fund will meet its obligations from maturities or sales of the securities earmarked and reserved for such purpose andor from cash flow if a fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition it could as with the disposition of any other portfolio obligation incur a gain or loss due to market fluctuation also a fund may be disadvantaged if the other party to the transaction defaults   part ii   forward commitments securities may be purchased for delivery at a future date which may increase their overall investment exposure and involves a risk of loss if the value of the securities declines prior to the settlement date in order to invest a fund’s assets immediately while awaiting delivery of securities purchased on a forward commitment basis shortterm obligations that offer sameday settlement and earnings will normally be purchased when a fund makes a commitment to purchase a security on a forward commitment basis cash or liquid securities equal to the amount of such fund’s commitments will be reserved for payment of the commitment for the purpose of determining the adequacy of the securities reserved for payment of commitments the reserved securities will be valued at market value if the market value of such securities declines additional cash cash equivalents or highly liquid securities will be reserved for payment of the commitment so that the value of the fund’s assets reserved for payment of the commitments will equal the amount of such commitments purchased by the respective fund purchases of securities on a forward commitment basis may involve more risk than other types of purchases securities purchased on a forward commitment basis and the securities held in the respective fund’s portfolio are subject to changes in value based upon the public’s perception of the issuer and changes real or anticipated in the level of interest rates purchasing securities on a forward commitment basis can involve the risk that the yields available in the market when the delivery takes place may actually be higher or lower than those obtained in the transaction itself on the settlement date of the forward commitment transaction the respective fund will meet its obligations from thenavailable cash flow sale of securities reserved for payment of the commitment sale of other securities or although it would not normally expect to do so from sale of the forward commitment securities themselves which may have a value greater or lesser than such fund’s payment obligations the sale of securities to meet such obligations may result in the realization of capital gains or losses purchasing securities on a forward commitment basis can also involve the risk of default by the other party on its obligation delaying or preventing the fund from recovering the collateral or completing the transaction to the extent a fund engages in forward commitment transactions it will do so for the purpose of acquiring securities consistent with its investment objective and policies and not for the purpose of investment leverage additional information regarding fund investment practices investments in the asia pacific region the economies in the asia pacific region are in all stages of economic development and may be intertwined the small size of securities markets and the low trading volume in some countries in the asia pacific region may lead to a lack of liquidity the share prices of companies in the region tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss many of the countries in the region are developing both politically and economically and as a result companies in the region may be subject to risks like nationalization or other forms of government interference andor may be heavily reliant on only a few industries or commodities investments in the region may also be subject to currency risks such as restrictions on the flow of money in and out of the country extreme volatility relative to the us dollar and devaluation all of which could decrease the value of a fund investments in the european market some of the funds may invest in securities in the european market a fund’s performance will be affected by political social and economic conditions in europe such as growth of the economic output the gross national product the rate of inflation the rate at which capital is reinvested into european economies the success of governmental actions to reduce budget deficits the resource selfsufficiency of european countries and interest and monetary exchange rates between european countries european financial markets may experience volatility due to concerns about high government debt levels credit rating downgrades rising unemployment the future of the euro as a common currency possible restructuring of government debt and other government measures responding to those concerns and fiscal and monetary controls imposed on member countries of the european union the risk of investing in europe may be heightened due to the referendum in which the united kingdom voted to exit the european union in addition if one or more countries were to exit the european union or abandon the use of the euro as a currency the value of investments tied to those countries or the euro could decline significantly and unpredictably investments in the commonwealth of puerto rico a fund’s investments in municipal securities may be affected by political and economic developments within the applicable municipality and by the financial condition of the municipality certain of the issuers in which a fund may invest have recently experienced or may experience significant financial difficulties for example puerto rico in particular has been experiencing significant financial difficulties the default by issuers of puerto rico   part ii   municipal securities on their obligations under securities held by a fund may adversely affect the fund and cause the fund to lose the value of its investment in such securities an insolvent municipality may take steps to reorganize its debt which might include extending debt maturities reducing the amount of principal or interest refinancing the debt or taking other measures that may significantly affect the rights of creditors and the value of the securities issued by the municipality and the value of a fund’s investments in those securities pursuant to chapter  of the us bankruptcy code certain municipalities that meet specific conditions may be provided protection from creditors while they develop and negotiate plans for reorganizing their debts the us bankruptcy code provides that individual us states are not permitted to pass their own laws purporting to bind nonconsenting creditors to a restructuring of a municipality’s indebtedness and thus all such restructurings must be pursuant to chapter  of the bankruptcy code municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare and certain provisions of the us bankruptcy code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested although puerto rico is a us territory neither puerto rico nor its subdivisions or agencies are eligible to file under the us bankruptcy code in order to seek protection from creditors or restructure their debt although recent puerto rico legislation that would have allowed certain puerto rico public corporations to seek protection from creditors and to restructure their debt should they become insolvent has been ruled unconstitutional the us supreme court has agreed to review this ruling if the us supreme court permits municipalities or public corporations in puerto rico to restructure their outstanding obligations it could have a negative impact on the marketability liquidity or value of certain investments held by a fund which could reduce a fund’s performance investments in the china region investing in china hong kong and taiwan collectively “the china region” involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in other more established economies or securities markets such risks may include a the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets or confiscatory taxation b greater social economic and political uncertainty including the risk of war c dependency on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade d the increasing competition from asia’s other lowcost emerging economies e greater price volatility and significantly smaller market capitalization of securities markets particularly in china f substantially less liquidity particularly of certain share classes of chinese securities g currency exchange rate fluctuations and the lack of available currency hedging instruments h higher rates of inflation i controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital and on a funds ability to exchange local currencies for us dollars j greater governmental involvement in and control over the economy k the risk that the chinese government may decide not to continue to support the economic reform programs implemented since  and could return to the prior completely centrally planned economy l the fact that china region companies particularly those located in china may be smaller less seasoned and newlyorganized companies m the difference in or lack of auditing and financial reporting standards which may result in unavailability of material information about issuers particularly in china n the fact that statistical information regarding the economy of china may be inaccurate or not comparable to statistical information regarding the us or other economies o the less extensive and still developing regulation of the securities markets business entities and commercial transactions p the fact that the settlement period of securities transactions in foreign markets may be longer q the willingness and ability of the chinese government to support the chinese and hong kong economies and markets is uncertain r the risk that it may be more difficult or impossible to obtain andor enforce a judgment than in other countries s the rapidity and erratic nature of growth particularly in china resulting in inefficiencies and dislocations and t the risk that because of the degree of interconnectivity between the economies and financial markets of china hong kong and taiwan any sizable reduction in the demand for goods from china or an economic downturn in china could negatively affect the economies and financial markets of hong kong and taiwan as well investment in the china region is subject to certain political risks following the establishment of the people’s republic of china by the communist party in  the chinese government renounced various debt obligations incurred by china’s predecessor governments which obligations remain in default and expropriated assets without compensation there can be no assurance that the chinese government will not take similar action in the future an investment in a fund involves risk of a total loss the political reunification of china and taiwan is a highly problematic issue and is unlikely to be settled in the near future this situation poses a threat to taiwan’s economy and could negatively affect its stock market china has committed by treaty to preserve hong kong’s autonomy and its economic political and social freedoms for fifty years from the july   transfer of sovereignty from great britain to china however if china would exert its authority so as to alter the economic political or legal structures   part ii   or the existing social policy of hong kong investor and business confidence in hong kong could be negatively affected which in turn could negatively affect markets and business performance as with all transition economies china’s ability to develop and sustain a credible legal regulatory monetary and socioeconomic system could influence the course of outside investment hong kong is closely tied to china economically and through china’s  acquisition of the country as a special autonomous region sar hong kong’s success depends in large part on its ability to retain the legal financial and monetary systems that allow economic freedom and market expansion in addition to the risks inherent in investing in the emerging markets the risks of investing in china hong kong and taiwan merit special consideration people’s republic of china the government of the people’s republic of china is dominated by the oneparty rule of the chinese communist party china’s economy has transitioned from a rigidly centralplanned staterun economy to one that has been only partially reformed by more marketoriented policies although the chinese government has implemented economic reform measures reduced state ownership of companies and established better corporate governance practices a substantial portion of productive assets in china are still owned by the chinese government the government continues to exercise significant control over regulating industrial development and ultimately control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies growth has also put a strain on china’s economy the government has attempted to slow down the pace of growth through monetary tightening and administrative measures however that policy started reversing in september  in part due to the current global economic crisis which has led to lower levels of economic growth and lower exports and foreign investments in the country the chinese government has taken unprecedented steps to shore up economic growth however the results of these measures are unpredictable over the long term the country’s major challenges will be dealing with its aging infrastructure worsening environmental conditions and rapidly widening urban and rural income gap as with all transition economies china’s ability to develop and sustain a credible legal regulatory monetary and socioeconomic system could influence the course of outside investment the chinese legal system in particular constitutes a significant risk factor for investors the chinese legal system is based on statutes over the past  years chinese legislative bodies have promulgated laws and regulations dealing with various economic matters such as foreign investment corporate organization and governance commerce taxation and trade however these laws are relatively new and published court decisions based on these laws are limited and nonbinding the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain hong kong in  great britain handed over control of hong kong to the chinese mainland government since that time hong kong has been governed by a semiconstitution known as the basic law which guarantees a high degree of autonomy in certain matters until  while defense and foreign affairs are the responsibility of the central government in beijing the chief executive of hong kong is appointed by the chinese government hong kong is able to participate in international organizations and agreements and it continues to function as an international financial center with no exchange controls free convertibility of the hong kong dollar and free inward and outward movement of capital the basic law guarantees existing freedoms including free speech and assembly press religion and the right to strike and travel business ownership private property the right of inheritance and foreign investment are also protected by law china has committed by treaty to preserve hong kong’s autonomy until  however if china were to exert its authority so as to alter the economic political or legal structures or the existing social policy of hong kong investor and business confidence in hong kong could be negatively affected which in turn could negatively affect markets and business performance in addition hong kong’s economy has entered a recession as a result of the current global economic crisis near term improvement in its economy appears unlikely taiwan for decades a state of hostility has existed between taiwan and the people’s republic of china beijing has long deemed taiwan a part of the “one china” and has made a nationalist cause of recovering it in the past china has staged frequent military provocations off the coast of taiwan and made threats of fullscale military action foreign trade has been the engine of rapid growth in taiwan and has transformed the island into one of asia’s great exporting nations however investing in taiwan involves the possibility of the imposition of exchange controls such as restrictions on the repatriation of fund investments or on the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies as an exportoriented economy taiwan depends on an open world trade regime and remains   part ii   vulnerable to downturns in the world economy taiwanese companies continue to compete mostly on price producing generic products or branded merchandise on behalf of multinational companies accordingly these businesses can be particularly vulnerable to currency volatility and increasing competition from neighboring lowercost countries moreover many taiwanese companies are heavily invested in mainland china and other countries throughout southeast asia making them susceptible to political events and economic crises in these parts of the region although taiwan has not yet suffered any major economic setbacks due to the current global economic crisis it is possible its economy could still be impacted the china region fund may hold a significant weighting in securities listed on either the shanghai andor shenzhen stock exchanges securities listed on these exchanges are divided into two classes a shares which are mostly limited to domestic investors and b shares which are allocated for both international and domestic investors the china region fund’s exposure to securities listed on either the shanghai or shenzhen exchanges will initially be through b shares the government of china has announced plans to exchange b shares for a shares and to merge the two markets such an event may produce greater liquidity and stability for the combined markets however it is uncertain whether or the extent to which these plans will be implemented in addition to b shares the china region fund may also invest in hong kong listed h shares hong kong listed red chips which are companies owned by mainland china enterprises but are listed in hong kong and companies that meet one of the following categories the company is organized under the laws of or has a principal office in china including hong kong and macau or taiwan the principal securities market for the issuer is china or taiwan the issuer derives at least  of its total revenues or profits from goods that are produced or sold investments made or services performed in china or taiwan or at least  of the issuer’s assets are located in china or taiwan shanghaihong kong stock connect and shenzhenhong kong stock connect the funds may invest in certain china ashares through the shanghaihong kong stock connect program or the shenzhenhong kong stock connect program the “programs” the programs are securities trading and clearing linked programs developed by hong kong exchanges and clearing limited “hkex” the hong kong securities clearing company limited “hkscc” shanghai stock exchange “sse” shenzhen stock exchange “szse” and china securities depository and clearing corporation limited “chinaclear” with an objective to achieve mutual stock market access between mainland china and hong kong the programs will allow foreign investors to trade certain sse and szse listed china ashares through hong kong based brokers trading through the programs are subject to various risks described below including liquidity risk currency risk legal and regulatory uncertainty risk execution risk operational risk tax risk counterparty risk and credit risk securities purchased under each program generally may not be sold purchased or otherwise transferred other than through that program in accordance with applicable rules while each program is not subject to individual investment quotas daily investment quotas apply to all program participants which may restrict or preclude the fund’s ability to purchase particular securities at a particular time in addition securities purchased through the programs are subject to chinese securities regulations that restrict the levels of foreign ownership in local securities which could require a fund to sell securities if ownership of the securities exceeds applicable quotas furthermore additional restrictions may preclude a fund from being eligible to invest in certain securities traded through a program because all trades in the programs must be settled in renminbi rmb the chinese currency investors must have timely access to a reliable supply of offshore rmb which cannot be guaranteed trades through each program are subject to certain requirements prior to trading which may limit the number of brokers that a fund may use this may affect the quality of execution received by a fund in addition applicable laws may under certain circumstances require an investor to return profits obtained from the purchase and sale of shares the hkscc provides clearing settlement nominee functions and other related services of the trades executed by hong kong market participants through an arrangement with chinaclear the people’s republic of china the “prc” regulations which include certain restrictions on selling and buying will apply to all market participants in the case of a sale brokers must have access to certain information about the transaction prior to execution because of the various requirements and restrictions applicable to the programs a fund may not be able to purchase andor dispose of holdings of china ashares in a timely manner a fund will not benefit from access to local investor compensation funds which are set up to protect against defaults of trades when investing through each program to the extent that hkscc is deemed to be performing safekeeping functions with respect to assets held through it it should be noted that the fund will have no legal relationship with hkscc and no direct legal recourse against hkscc in the event that the fund suffers losses resulting from the performance or insolvency of hkscc   part ii   the shanghaihong kong stock connect program began operation in november  and the shenzhenhong kong stock connect program began operation in december  the relevant regulations relating to the programs are untested and subject to change there is no certainty as to how they will be applied which could adversely affect a fund the programs require use of new information technology systems which may be subject to operational risk due to its crossborder nature if the relevant systems fail to function properly trading in the shanghai and shenzhen markets through the programs could be disrupted as in other emerging and less developed markets the legislative framework is only beginning to develop the concept of legalformal ownership and of beneficial ownership or interest in securities in china consequently the applicable courts may consider that any nominee or custodian as registered holder of securities would have full ownership thereof and that a beneficial owner may have no rights whatsoever in respect thereof and may be limited in its ability to pursue claims against the issuer of a security additionally the securities that a fund may invest in through the programs may present illiquidity and price volatility concerns and difficulty in determining market valuations of securities due to limited public information on issuers such securities may also be subject to limited regulatory oversight and an increased risk of being delisted or suspended suspensions or delistings may become widespread and the length of any suspension may be significant and difficult to predict the programs utilize an omnibus clearing structure and a fund’s shares will be registered in its custodian’s subcustodian’s or clearing broker’s name on the hkscc system and in hkscc’s name on the chinaclear system this may limit a fund’s adviser’s or subadviser’s ability to effectively manage a fund and may expose a fund to the credit risk of its custodian or subcustodian or to greater risk of expropriation similarly hkscc would be responsible for the exercise of shareholder rights with respect to corporate actions including all dividends rights issues merger proposals or other shareholder votes while hkscc may provide investors with the opportunity to provide voting instructions investors may not have sufficient time or the opportunity to consider proposals or provide instructions investments in the programs may not be covered by the securities investor protection programs of either exchange and without the protection of such programs will be subject to the risk of default by a broker in the event chinaclear defaults hkscc’s liabilities under its market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants with claims while it is anticipated that hkscc will act in good faith to seek recovery of the outstanding stocks and monies from chinaclear through available legal channels or the liquidation of chinaclear there can be no assurances that it will do so or that it will be successful in doing so in this event the fund may not fully recover its losses and the process could be delayed the programs will only operate on days when both the prc and hong kong markets are open for trading and when banks in each applicable market are open on the corresponding settlement days and the funds will only trade through each program on days that they are open there may be occasions when it is a normal trading day for the prc market but the fund cannot carry out any china ashares trading a fund may be subject to risks of price fluctuations in china ashares during the time when each program is not trading as a result additionally different fees and costs are imposed on foreign investors acquiring china ashares acquired through the programs and these fees and costs may be higher than comparable fees and costs imposed on owners of other securities providing similar investment exposure there is uncertainty of whether and how certain gains on prc securities will to be taxed the possibility of the rules being changed and the possibility of taxes being applied retrospectively consequently investors may be advantaged or disadvantaged depending upon the final outcome of how such gains will be taxed and when they subscribed andor redeemed their shares because the programs are relatively new the actual effect on the market for trading china ashares with the introduction of large numbers of foreign investors is unknown the programs are subject to regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities for the applicable exchanges and further regulations or restrictions such as limitations on redemptions or suspension of trading may adversely impact the programs if the authorities believe it necessary to assure orderly markets or for other reasons there is no guarantee that the exchanges will continue to support the programs in the future investments in india securities of many issuers in the indian market may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers but may offer the potential for higher returns over the long term indian securities will generally be denominated in foreign currency mainly the rupee accordingly the value of the fund will fluctuate depending on the rate of exchange between the us dollar and such foreign currency india has less developed clearance and settlement procedures and there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with   part ii   the volume of securities and have been significantly delayed the indian stock exchanges have in the past been subject to closure broker defaults and broker strikes and there can be no certainty that this will not recur in addition significant delays are common in registering transfers of securities and the fund may be unable to sell securities until the registration process is completed and may experience delays in receipt of dividends and other entitlements the value of investments in indian securities may also be affected by political and economic developments social religious or regional tensions changes in government regulation and government intervention high rates of inflation or interest rates and withholding tax affecting india the risk of loss may also be increased because there may be less information available about indian issuers since they are not subject to the extensive accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices which are applicable in north america there is also a lower level of regulation and monitoring of the indian securities market and its participants than in other more developed markets foreign investment in the securities of issuers in india is usually restricted or controlled to some degree in addition the availability of financial instruments with exposure to indian financial markets may be substantially limited by the restrictions on foreign institutional investors “fiis” only registered fiis and nonindian mutual funds that comply with certain statutory conditions may make direct portfolio investments in exchangetraded indian securities jpmim is a registered fii fiis are required to observe certain investment restrictions which may limit the fund’s ability to invest in issuers or to fully pursue its investment objective income gains and initial capital with respect to such investments are freely repatriable subject to payment of applicable indian taxes india’s guidelines under which foreign investors may invest in indian securities are new and evolving there can be no assurance that these investment control regimes will not change in a way that makes it more difficult or impossible for a fund to implement investment objective or repatriate its income gains and initial capital from these countries similar risks and considerations will be applicable to the extent that a fund invests in other countries recently certain policies have served to restrict foreign investment and such policies may have the effect of reducing demand for such investments india may require withholding on dividends paid on portfolio securities and on realized capital gains in the past these taxes have sometimes been substantial there can be no assurance that restrictions on repatriation of a fund’s income gains or initial capital from india will not occur a high proportion of the shares of many issuers in india may be held by a limited number of persons and financial institutions which may limit the number of shares available for investment in addition further issuances or the perception that such issuances may occur of securities by indian issuers in which a fund has invested could dilute the earnings per share of a fund’s investment and could adversely affect the market price of such securities sales of securities by such issuer’s major shareholders or the perception that such sales may occur may also significantly and adversely affect the market price of such securities and in turn a fund’s investment the prices at which investments may be acquired may be affected by trading by persons with material nonpublic information and by securities transactions by brokers in anticipation of transactions by a fund in particular securities similarly volume and liquidity in the bond markets in india are less than in the united states and at times price volatility can be greater than in the united states the limited liquidity of securities markets in india may also affect a fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so in addition india’s securities markets are susceptible to being influenced by large investors trading significant blocks of securities india’s stock market is undergoing a period of growth and change which may result in trading volatility and difficulties in the settlement and recording of transactions and in interpreting and applying the relevant law and regulations the securities industry in india is comparatively underdeveloped stockbrokers and other intermediaries in india may not perform as well as their counterparts in the united states and other more developed securities markets political and economic structures in india are undergoing significant evolution and rapid development and may lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of the united states the risks described above including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets may be heightened in addition unanticipated political or social developments may affect the values of investments in india and the availability of additional investments the laws in india relating to limited liability of corporate shareholders fiduciary duties of officers and directors and the bankruptcy of state enterprises are generally less well developed than or different from such laws in the united states it may be more difficult to obtain or enforce a judgment in the courts in india than it is in the united states monsoons and natural disasters also can affect the value of investments religious and border disputes persist in india moreover india has from time to time experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries such as pakistan the indian government has confronted separatist movements in several indian states the longstanding dispute with pakistan over the bordering indian state of   part ii   jammu and kashmir a majority of whose population is muslim remains unresolved if the indian government is unable to control the violence and disruption associated with these tensions the results could destabilize the economy and consequently adversely affect the fund’s investments a fund may use pnotes indianbased brokerages may buy indianbased securities and then issue pnotes to foreign investors any dividends or capital gains collected from the underlying securities may be remitted to the foreign investors however unlike adrs notes are subject to credit risk based on the uncertainty of the counterparty’s ie the indianbased brokerage’s ability to meet its obligations investments in japan the japanese economy may be subject to economic political and social instability which could have a negative impact on japanese securities in the past japan’s economic growth rate has remained relatively low and it may remain low in the future at times the japanese economy has been adversely impacted by government intervention and protectionism changes in its labor market and an unstable financial services sector international trade government support of the financial services sector and other troubled sectors government policy natural disasters andor geopolitical developments could significantly affect the japanese economy a significant portion of japan’s trade is conducted with developing nations and can be affected by conditions in these nations or by currency fluctuations japan is an island state with few natural resources and limited land area and is reliant on imports for its commodity needs any fluctuations or shortages in the commodity markets could have a negative impact on the japanese economy investments in the middle east and africa certain countries in the region are in early stages of development as a result there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries as well as a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries brokers may be fewer in number and less well capitalized than brokers in more developed regions certain economies in the region depend to a significant degree upon exports of commodities and are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices which in turn may be affected by a variety of factors in addition certain governments in the region have exercised substantial influence over the private sector including ownership or control of companies governmental actions in the future could have a significant economic impact certain armed conflict territorial disputes historical animosities regional instability terrorist activities and religious ethnic andor socioeconomic unrest such developments could have a negative effect on economic growth and could result in significant disruptions in the securities markets including securities held by a fund certain middle eastern and african countries have currencies pegged to the us dollar which if abandoned could cause sudden and significant currency adjustments which could impact the fund’s investment returns in those countries the legal systems and the unpredictability thereof in certain countries in the region also may have an adverse impact on the fund and may expose the fund to significant or unlimited liabilities investment in certain countries in the region by the fund may be restricted or prohibited under applicable regulation and the fund as a foreign investor may be required to obtain approvals and may have to invest on less advantageous terms including price than nationals a fund’s investments in securities of a country in the region may be subject to economic sanctions or other government restrictions which may negatively impact the value or liquidity of the fund’s investments investments in the region may adversely impact the operations of the fund through the delay of the fund’s ability to exercise its rights as a security holder substantial limitations may exist in the region with respect to the fund’s ability to repatriate investment income capital gains or its investment securities which are subject to material legal restrictions on repatriation of assets will be considered illiquid securities by the fund and subject to the limitations on illiquid investments investments in latin america as an emerging market latin america has long suffered from political economic and social instability for investors this has meant additional risk caused by periods of regional conflict political corruption totalitarianism protectionist measures nationalization hyperinflation debt crises sudden and large currency devaluation and intervention by the military in civilian and economic spheres however much has changed in the past decade democracy is beginning to become well established in some countries a move to a more mature and accountable political environment is well under way domestic economies have been deregulated privatization of stateowned companies is almost completed and foreign trade restrictions have been relaxed nonetheless to the extent that events such as those listed above continue in the future they could reverse favorable trends toward market and economic reform privatization and removal of trade barriers and result in significant disruption in securities markets in the region investors in the region continue to face a number of potential risks governments of many latin american countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector   part ii   governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in latin american countries which could affect the companies in which the latin america fund invests and therefore the value of fund shares certain latin american countries may experience sudden and large adjustments in their currency which in turn can have a disruptive and negative effect on foreign investors for example in late  the mexican peso lost more than onethird of its value relative to the us dollar in  the brazilian real lost  of its value against the us dollar certain latin american countries may impose restrictions on the free conversion of their currency into foreign currencies including the us dollar there is no significant foreign exchange market for many currencies and it would as a result be difficult for certain funds to engage in foreign currency transactions designed to protect the value of the funds’ interests in securities denominated in such currencies almost all of the region’s economies have become highly dependent upon foreign credit and loans from external sources to fuel their statesponsored economic plans government profligacy and illconceived plans for modernization have exhausted these resources with little benefit accruing to the economy and most countries have been forced to restructure their loans or risk default on their debt obligations in addition interest on the debt is subject to market conditions and may reach levels that would impair economic activity and create a difficult and costly environment for borrowers accordingly these governments may be forced to reschedule or freeze their debt repayment which could negatively affect the stock market latin american economies that depend on foreign credit and loans could fall into recession because of tighter international credit supplies due to the current global economic crisis substantial limitations may exist in certain countries with respect to a fund’s ability to repatriate investment income capital or the proceeds of sales of securities a fund could be adversely affected by delays in or a refusal to grant any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital as well as by the application to the fund of any restrictions on investments certain latin american countries have entered into regional trade agreements that are designed to among other things reduce barriers between countries increase competition among companies and reduce government subsidies in certain industries no assurance can be given that these changes will be successful in the long term or that these changes will result in the economic stability intended there is a possibility that these trade arrangements will not be fully implemented or will be partially or completely unwound it is also possible that a significant participant could choose to abandon a trade agreement which could diminish its credibility and influence any of these occurrences could have adverse effects on the markets of both participating and nonparticipating countries including sharp appreciation or depreciation of participants’ national currencies and a significant increase in exchange rate volatility a resurgence in economic protectionism an undermining of confidence in the latin american markets an undermining of latin american economic stability the collapse or slowdown of the drive towards latin american economic unity andor reversion of the attempts to lower government debt and inflation rates that were introduced in anticipation of such trade agreements such developments could have an adverse impact on a fund’s investments in latin america generally or in specific countries participating in such trade agreements terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led and may in the future lead to increased shortterm market volatility and may have adverse longterm effects on world economies and markets generally investments in russia investing in russian securities is highly speculative and involves significant risks and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities markets of the us and most other developed countries over the past century russia has experienced political social and economic turbulence and has endured decades of communist rule under which the property of tens of millions of its citizens was collectivized into state agricultural and industrial enterprises since the collapse of the soviet union russia’s government has been faced with the daunting task of stabilizing its domestic economy while transforming it into a modern and efficient structure able to compete in international markets and respond to the needs of its citizens however to date many of the country’s economic reform initiatives have floundered as the proceeds of international monetary fund and other economic assistance have been squandered or stolen in this environment there is always the risk that the nation’s government will abandon the current program of economic reform and replace it with radically different political and economic policies that would be detrimental to the interests of foreign investors this could entail a return to a centrally planned economy and nationalization of private enterprises similar to what existed in the soviet union many of russia’s businesses have failed to mobilize the available factors of production because the country’s privatization program virtually ensured the predominance of the old management teams that are largely nonmarketoriented in their management approach poor accounting standards inept management pervasive corruption insider   part ii   trading and crime and inadequate regulatory protection for the rights of investors all pose a significant risk particularly to foreign investors in addition there is the risk that the russian tax system will not be reformed to prevent inconsistent retroactive andor exorbitant taxation or in the alternative the risk that a reformed tax system may result in the inconsistent and unpredictable enforcement of the new tax laws compared to most national stock markets the russian securities market suffers from a variety of problems not encountered in more developed markets there is little longterm historical data on the russian securities market because it is relatively new and a substantial proportion of securities transactions in russia are privately negotiated outside of stock exchanges the inexperience of the russian securities market and the limited volume of trading in securities in the market may make obtaining accurate prices on portfolio securities from independent sources more difficult than in more developed markets additionally because of less stringent auditing and financial reporting standards that apply to companies operating in russia there is little solid corporate information available to investors as a result it may be difficult to assess the value or prospects of an investment in russian companies stocks of russian companies also may experience greater price volatility than stocks of us companies settlement clearing and registration of securities transactions in russia are subject to additional risks because of the recent formation of the russian securities market the underdeveloped state of the banking and telecommunications systems and the overall legal and regulatory framework prior to  there was no central registration system for equity share registration in russia and registration was carried out by either the issuers themselves or by registrars located throughout russia such registrars were not necessarily subject to effective state supervision nor were they licensed with any governmental entity thereby increasing the risk that a fund could lose ownership of its securities through fraud negligence or even mere oversight with the implementation of the national settlement depository “nsd” in russia as a recognized central securities depository title to russian equities is now based on the records of the depository and not the registrars although the implementation of the nsd is generally expected to decrease the risk of loss in connection with recording and transferring title to securities issues resulting in loss still might occur in addition issuers and registrars are still prominent in the validation and approval of documentation requirements for corporate action processing in russia because the documentation requirements and approval criteria vary between registrars andor issuers there remain unclear and inconsistent market standards in the russian market with respect to the completion and submission of corporate action elections to the extent that a fund suffers a loss relating to title or corporate actions relating to its portfolio securities it may be difficult for the fund to enforce its rights or otherwise remedy the loss the russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals forestry products oil and gas accordingly it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products foreign investors also face a high degree of currency risk when investing in russian securities and a lack of available currency hedging instruments in a surprise move in august  russia devalued the ruble defaulted on shortterm domestic bonds and imposed a moratorium on the repayment of its international debt and the restructuring of the repayment terms these actions have negatively affected russian borrowers’ ability to access international capital markets and have had a damaging impact on the russian economy in light of these and other government actions foreign investors face the possibility of further devaluations in addition there is a risk that the government may impose capital controls on foreign portfolio investments in the event of extreme financial or political crisis such capital controls would prevent the sale of a portfolio of foreign assets and the repatriation of investment income and capital the current economic turmoil in russia and the effects on the current global economic crisis on the russian economy may cause flight from the russian ruble into us dollars and other currencies which could force the russian central bank to spend reserves to maintain the value of the ruble if the russian central bank falters in its defense of the ruble there could be additional pressure on russia’s banks and its currency the united states may impose economic sanctions against companies in various sectors of the russian economy including but not limited to the financial services energy metals and mining engineering and defense and defenserelated materials sectors these sanctions if imposed could impair a fund’s ability to invest in securities it views as attractive investment opportunities for example a fund may be prohibited from investing in securities issued by companies subject to such sanctions in addition the sanctions may require a fund to freeze its existing investments in russian companies prohibiting the fund from selling or otherwise transacting in these investments this could impact a fund’s ability to sell securities or other financial instruments as needed to meet shareholder redemptions terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led and may in the future lead to increased shortterm market volatility and may have adverse longterm effects on world economies and markets generally   part ii   risk management each fund may employ nonhedging risk management techniques risk management strategies are used to keep the funds fully invested and to reduce the transaction costs associated with cash flows into and out of a fund the funds use a wide variety of instruments and strategies for risk management and the examples below are not meant to be exhaustive examples of risk management strategies include synthetically altering the duration of a portfolio or the mix of securities in a portfolio for example if the adviser wishes to extend maturities in a fixed income portfolio in order to take advantage of an anticipated decline in interest rates but does not wish to purchase the underlying longterm securities it might cause a fund to purchase futures contracts on long term debt securities likewise if the adviser wishes to gain exposure to an instrument but does not wish to purchase the instrument it may use swaps and related instruments similarly if the adviser wishes to decrease exposure to fixed income securities or purchase equities it could cause the fund to sell futures contracts on debt securities and purchase futures contracts on a stock index such nonhedging risk management techniques involve leverage and thus present as do all leveraged transactions the possibility of losses as well as gains that are greater than if these techniques involved the purchase and sale of the securities themselves rather than their synthetic derivatives special factors affecting certain funds in addition to the investment strategies and policies described above certain funds may employ other investment strategies and policies or similar strategies and policies to a greater extent and therefore may be subject to additional risks or similar risks to a greater extent for instance certain funds which invest in certain state specific securities may be subject to special considerations regarding such investments for a description of such additional investment strategies and policies as well as corresponding risks for such funds see part i of this sai diversification certain funds are diversified funds and as such intend to meet the diversification requirements of the  act please refer to the funds’ prospectuses for information about whether a fund is a diversified or nondiversified fund current  act diversification requirements require that with respect to  of the assets of a fund the fund may not invest more than  of its total assets in the securities of any one issuer or own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer except cash or cash items obligations of the us government its agencies and instrumentalities and securities of other investment companies as for the other  of a fund’s assets not subject to the limitation described above there is no limitation on investment of these assets under the  act so that all of such assets may be invested in securities of any one issuer investments not subject to the limitations described above could involve an increased risk to a fund should an issuer be unable to make interest or principal payments or should the market value of such securities decline each of the money market funds intends to comply with the diversification requirements imposed by rule a of the  act certain other funds are registered as nondiversified investment companies a fund is considered “nondiversified” because a relatively high percentage of the fund’s assets may be invested in the securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers primarily within the same economic sector a nondiversified fund’s portfolio securities therefore may be more susceptible to any single economic political or regulatory occurrence than the portfolio securities of a more diversified investment company regardless of whether a fund is diversified under the  act all of the funds will comply with the diversification requirements imposed by the code for qualification as a regulated investment company see “distributions and tax matters” distributions and tax matters the following discussion is a brief summary of some of the important federal and where noted state income tax consequences affecting each fund and its shareholders there may be other tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders except as otherwise noted in a fund’s prospectus the funds are not intended for foreign shareholders as a result this section does not address in detail the tax consequences affecting any shareholder who as to the us is a nonresident alien individual foreign trust or estate foreign corporation or foreign partnership this section is based on the code the regulations thereunder published rulings and court decisions all as currently in effect these laws are subject to change possibly on a retroactive basis the following tax discussion is very general therefore prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors about the impact an investment in a fund may have on their own tax situations and the possible application of foreign state and local law   part ii   each fund generally will be treated as a separate entity for federal income tax purposes and thus the provisions of the code generally will be applied to each fund separately net longterm and shortterm capital gain net income and operating expenses therefore will be determined separately for each fund special tax rules apply to investments held through defined contribution plans and other taxqualified plans shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the suitability of shares of the fund as an investment through such plans qualification as a regulated investment company each fund intends to elect to be treated and qualify each year as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code in order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies and their shareholders each fund must among other things     a derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year from i dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gain from options swaps futures or forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and ii net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” “qptps” defined below     b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the fund’s taxable year i at least  of the market value of the fund’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than  of the value of the fund’s total assets and not more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested x in the securities other than cash or cash items or securities issued by the us government or other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or y in the securities of one or more qptps in the case of a fund’s investments in loan participations the fund shall treat both the financial intermediary and the issuer of the underlying loan as an issuer for the purposes of meeting this diversification requirement and     c distribute with respect to each taxable year at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid — generally taxable ordinary income and any excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss and net taxexempt interest income for such taxable year in general for purposes of the  gross income requirement described in paragraph a above income derived from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by the regulated investment company however  of the net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” defined as a partnership x interests in which are traded on an established securities markets or readily tradable on a secondary market as the substantial equivalents thereof y that derives at least  of its income from passive income sources defined in section d of the code and z that derives less than  of its income from the qualifying income described in ai above will be treated as qualifying income although income from a qptp is qualifying income as discussed above investments in qptps cannot exceed  of the fund’s assets in addition although in general the passive loss rules of the code do not apply to regulated investment companies such rules do apply to a regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qptp gains from foreign currencies including foreign currency options foreign currency swaps foreign currency futures and foreign currency forward contracts currently constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  test described in paragraph a above however the treasury department has the authority to issue regulations possibly with retroactive effect excluding from the definition of “qualifying income” a fund’s foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not directly related to the fund’s principal business of investing in stock or securities for purposes of paragraph b above the term “outstanding voting securities of such issuer” will include the equity securities of a qptp a fund’s investment in mlps may qualify as an investment in  a qptp  a “regular” partnership  a “passive foreign investment company” a “pfic” or  a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the treatment of particular mlps for us federal income tax purposes will affect the extent to which a fund can invest in mlps the us federal income tax consequences of a fund’s investments in “pfics” and “regular” partnerships are discussed in greater detail below   part ii   if a fund qualifies for a taxable year as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment the fund will not be subject to federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends including capital gain dividends defined below if a fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company accorded special tax treatment in any taxable year the fund would be subject to taxation on its taxable income at corporate rates and all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gain would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income some portions of such distributions may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction in the case of corporate shareholders and for treatment as qualified dividend income in the case of individual shareholders in addition the fund could be required to recognize unrealized gain pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment each fund intends to distribute at least annually to its shareholders all or substantially all of its investment company taxable income computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and may distribute its net capital gain that is the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss investment company taxable income which is retained by a fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate tax rates a fund might also retain for investment its net capital gain if a fund does retain such net capital gain such gain will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained but the fund may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gain in a notice to its shareholders who i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their respective shares of the undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their respective shares of the tax paid by the fund on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities for federal income tax purposes the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of a fund will be increased by an amount equal under current law to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gain included in the shareholder’s gross income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause ii of the preceding sentence in determining its net capital gain including in connection with determining the amount available to support a capital gain dividend its taxable income and its earnings and profits a fund may elect to treat part or all of any postoctober capital loss defined as the greatest of net capital loss net longterm capital loss or net shortterm capital loss in each case attributable to the portion of the taxable year after october  or lateyear ordinary loss generally i net ordinary loss from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property attributable to the portion of the taxable year after october  plus ii other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion of the taxable year after december  as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year excise tax on regulated investment companies if a fund fails to distribute in a calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income taking into account certain deferrals and elections for such year and  of its capital gain net income adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  or later if the fund is permitted to elect and so elects plus any retained amount from the prior year the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts the funds intend to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the  excise tax although each fund reserves the right to pay an excise tax rather than make an additional distribution when circumstances warrant eg the excise tax amount is deemed by a fund to be de minimis certain derivative instruments give rise to ordinary income and loss if a fund has a taxable year that begins in one calendar year and ends in the next calendar year the fund will be required to make this excise tax distribution during its taxable year there is a risk that a fund could recognize income prior to making this excise tax distribution and could recognize losses after making this distribution as a result all or a portion of an excise tax distribution could constitute a return of capital see discussion below fund distributions the funds anticipate distributing substantially all of their net investment income for each taxable year distributions are taxable to shareholders even if they are paid from income or gain earned by the fund before a shareholder’s investment and thus were included in the price the shareholder paid distributions are taxable whether shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares a shareholder whose distributions are reinvested in shares will be treated as having received a dividend equal to the amount of cash that the shareholder would have received if such shareholder had elected to receive the distribution in cash dividends and distributions on a fund’s shares generally are subject to federal income tax as described herein to the extent they do not exceed the fund’s realized income and gains even though such dividends and distributions may represent economically a return of a particular shareholder’s investment such dividends and distributions are likely to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when the fund’s net asset value reflects gains that are either i unrealized or ii realized but not distributed   part ii   for federal income tax purposes distributions of net investment income generally are taxable as ordinary income taxes on distributions of capital gain are determined by how long a fund owned the investment that generated it rather than how long a shareholder may have owned shares in the fund distributions of net capital gain from the sale of investments that a fund owned for more than one year and that are properly designated by the fund as capital gain dividends “capital gain dividends” will be taxable as longterm capital gain distributions of capital gain generally are made after applying any available capital loss carryovers the maximum individual rate applicable to longterm capital gains is either  or  depending on whether the individual’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts a distribution of gain from the sale of investments that a fund owned for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income distributions attributable to gain from the sale of mlps that is characterized as ordinary income under the code’s recapture provisions will be taxable as ordinary income distributions of investment income designated by a fund as derived from “qualified dividend income” will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain in order for some portion of the dividends received by a fund shareholder to be qualified dividend income the fund must meet certain holdingperiod and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividendpaying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet certain holdingperiod and other requirements with respect to the fund’s shares a dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income at either the fund or shareholder level i if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for fewer than  days during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend or in the case of certain preferred stock  days during the day period beginning  days before such date ii to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property iii if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment interest for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest or iv if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is a not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the us with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation readily tradable on an established securities market in the us or b treated as a pfic in general distributions of investment income designated by a fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a noncorporate taxable shareholder so long as the shareholder meets the holding period and other requirements described above with respect to the fund’s shares in any event if the qualified dividend income received by each fund during any taxable year is equal to or greater than  of its “gross income” then  of the fund’s dividends other than dividends that are properly designated as capital gain dividends will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income for this purpose the only gain included in the term “gross income” is the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss if a fund receives dividends from an underlying fund and the underlying fund designates such dividends as “qualified dividend income” then the fund may in turn designate a portion of its distributions as “qualified dividend income” as well provided the fund meets the holdingperiod and other requirements with respect to shares of the underlying fund any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received by the shareholder with respect to those shares all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of fund shares will be disallowed if other shares of such fund are purchased within  days before or after the disposition in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss a distribution paid to shareholders by a fund in january of a year generally is deemed to have been received by shareholders on december  of the preceding year if the distribution was declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in october november or december of that preceding year the funds will provide federal tax information annually including information about dividends and distributions paid during the preceding year to taxable investors and others requesting such information if a fund makes a distribution to its shareholders in excess of its current and accumulated “earnings and profits” in any taxable year the excess distribution will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of each shareholder’s basis for tax purposes in its shares and any distribution in excess of basis will be treated as capital gain a return of capital is not taxable but it reduces the shareholder’s basis in its shares which reduces the loss or increases the gain on a subsequent taxable disposition by such shareholder of the shares dividends of net investment income received by corporate shareholders other than shareholders that are s corporations of a fund will qualify for the  dividendsreceived deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of qualifying dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations for the taxable year a dividend received by a fund will not be treated as a qualifying dividend  if the stock on which the   part ii   dividend is paid is considered to be “debtfinanced” generally acquired with borrowed funds  if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that the fund has held less than  days  days in the case of certain preferred stock during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend during the day period beginning  days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock or  to the extent that the fund is under an obligation pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property moreover the dividendsreceived deduction may be disallowed or reduced  if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of a fund or  by application of the code however any distributions received by a fund from reits and pfics will not qualify for the corporate dividendsreceived deduction an additional  medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from a fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of fund shares but excluding any exempt interest dividends from a fund of us individuals estates and trusts to the extent that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” in the case of an individual or “adjusted gross income” in the case of an estate or trust exceeds certain threshold amounts sale or redemption of shares the sale exchange or redemption of fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss in general any gain or loss arising from or treated as arising from the sale or redemption of shares of the fund will be considered capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the shares were held for more than one year however any capital loss arising from the sale or redemption of shares held for six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received on or undistributed capital gains credited with respect to such shares additionally any loss realized upon the sale or exchange of fund shares with a tax holding period of six months or less may be disallowed to the extent of any distributions treated as exempt interest dividends with respect to such shares the maximum individual rate applicable to longterm capital gains is either  or  depending on whether the individual’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts capital gain of a corporate shareholder is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income with respect to the prime money market fund shareholders may elect to adopt a simplified “nav method” for computing gains and losses from taxable sales exchanges or redemptions of fund shares under the nav method rather than computing gain or loss separately for each taxable disposition of fund shares as described above a shareholder would determine gain or loss based on the change in the aggregate value of the shareholder’s fund shares during a computation period which could be the shareholder’s taxable year or certain shorter periods reduced by the shareholder’s net investment purchases minus taxable sales exchanges or redemptions or exchanges in those fund shares during that period under the nav method if a shareholder holds the shares as a capital asset any resulting net gain or loss would be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss fund investments certain investments of the funds including transactions in options swaptions futures contracts forward contracts straddles swaps short sales foreign currencies inflationlinked securities and foreign securities including for hedging purposes will be subject to special tax rules including marktomarket constructive sale straddle wash sale and short sale rules in a given case these rules may accelerate income to a fund defer losses to a fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of a fund’s securities convert longterm capital gain into shortterm capital gain convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital loss or otherwise affect the character of a fund’s income these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders and cause differences between a fund’s book income and its taxable income if a fund’s book income exceeds its taxable income the distribution if any of such excess generally will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the fund’s remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipient’s basis in its shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if a fund’s book income is less than taxable income the fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment income earned as a result of these transactions would in general not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction or for treatment as exemptinterest dividends when distributed to shareholders the funds will endeavor to make any available elections pertaining to such transactions in a manner believed to be in the best interest of each fund and its shareholders the fund’s participation in loans of securities may affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders with respect to any security subject to a securities loan any i amounts received by the fund in place   part ii   of dividends earned on the security during the period that such security was not directly held by the fund will not give rise to qualified dividend income and ii withholding taxes accrued on dividends during the period that such security was not directly held by the fund will not qualify as a foreign tax paid by the fund and therefore cannot be passed through to shareholders even if the fund meets the requirements described in “foreign taxes” below certain debt securities purchased by the funds are sold at an original issue discount and thus do not make periodic cash interest payments similarly zerocoupon bonds do not make periodic interest payments generally the amount of the original issue discount is treated as interest income and is included in taxable income and required to be distributed over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time usually when the debt security matures in addition paymentinkind securities will give rise to income that is required to be distributed and is taxable even though the fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year because each fund distributes substantially all of its net investment income to its shareholders including such imputed interest a fund may have to sell portfolio securities in order to generate the cash necessary for the required distributions such sales may occur at a time when the adviser would not otherwise have chosen to sell such securities and may result in a taxable gain or loss some of the funds may invest in inflationlinked debt securities any increase in the principal amount of an inflationlinked debt security will be original issue discount which is taxable as ordinary income and is required to be distributed even though the fund will not receive the principal including any increase thereto until maturity a fund investing in such securities may be required to liquidate other investments including at times when it is not advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its distribution requirements and to eliminate any possible taxation at the fund level certain debt securities that may be acquired by a fund in the secondary market may be treated as having market discount generally any gain recognized on the disposition of and any partial payment of principal on a debt security having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain or principal payment does not exceed the “accrued market discount” on such debt security market discount generally accrues in equal daily installments a fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt securities having market discount which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income a fund may invest to a significant extent in debt obligations that are in the lowest rated categories or are unrated including debt obligations of issuers that are not currently paying interest or that are in default investments in debt obligations that are at risk of being in default or are presently in default present special tax issues for a fund tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when a fund may cease to accrue interest original issue discount or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by each fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income taxation or any excise tax transactions of certain funds in foreign currencies foreign currency denominated debt securities and certain foreign currency options future contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may accelerate income recognition and result in ordinary income or loss to a fund for federal income tax purposes which will be taxable to the shareholders as such when it is distributed to them special tax considerations apply if a fund invests in investment companies that are taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes in general the fund will not recognize income earned by such an investment company until the close of the investment company’s taxable year but the fund will recognize such income as it is earned by the investment company for purposes of determining whether it is subject to the  excise tax therefore if the fund and such an investment company have different taxable years the fund may be compelled to make distributions in excess of the income recognized from such an investment company in order to avoid the imposition of the  excise tax a fund’s receipt of a nonliquidating cash distribution from an investment company taxable as a partnership generally will result in recognized gain but not loss only to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds the fund’s adjusted basis in shares of such investment company before the distribution a fund that receives a liquidating cash distribution from an investment company taxable as a partnership will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by the fund and the fund’s adjusted tax basis in shares of such investment company however the fund will recognize ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent that the fund’s allocable share of “unrealized receivables” including any accrued but untaxed market discount exceeds the shareholder’s share of the basis in those unrealized receivables some amounts received by each fund with respect to its investments in mlps will likely be treated as a return of capital because of accelerated deductions available with respect to the activities of such mlps on the disposition of an investment in such an mlp the fund will likely realize taxable income in excess of economic gain with respect to that asset or if the fund does not dispose of the mlp the fund likely will realize taxable income in   part ii   excess of cash flow with respect to the mlp in a later period and the fund must take such income into account in determining whether the fund has satisfied its distribution requirements the fund may have to borrow or liquidate securities to satisfy its distribution requirements and to meet its redemption requests even though investment considerations might otherwise make it undesirable for the fund to sell securities or borrow money at such time some of the funds may invest in reits such investments in reit equity securities may require a fund to accrue and distribute income not yet received in order to generate sufficient cash to make the requisite distributions the fund may be required to sell securities in its portfolio including when it is not advantageous to do so that it otherwise would have continued to hold a fund’s investments in reit equity securities may at other times result in the fund’s receipt of cash in excess of the reit’s earnings if the fund distributes such amounts such distribution could constitute a return of capital to fund shareholders for federal income tax purposes dividends received by a fund from a reit generally will not constitute qualified dividend income a fund might invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits “remics” or equity interests in taxable mortgage pools “tmps” under a notice issued by the irs in october  and treasury regulations that have not yet been issued but may apply with retroactive effect a portion of a fund’s income from a reit that is attributable to the reit’s residual interest in a remic or a tmp referred to in the code as an “excess inclusion” will be subject to federal income taxation in all events this notice also provides and the regulations are expected to provide that excess inclusion income of a regulated investment company such as each of the funds will generally be allocated to shareholders of the regulated investment company in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders with the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related remic or tmp residual interest directly in general excess inclusion income allocated to shareholders i cannot be offset by net operating losses subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions and ii will constitute unrelated business taxable income “ubti” to entities including a qualified pension plan an individual retirement account a k plan a keogh plan or other taxexempt entity subject to tax on ubti thereby potentially requiring such an entity that is allocated excess inclusion income and otherwise might not be required to file a tax return to file a tax return and pay tax on such income in addition because the code provides that excess inclusion income is ineligible for treaty benefits a regulated investment company must withhold tax on excess inclusions attributable to its foreign shareholders at a  rate of withholding regardless of any treaty benefits for which a shareholder is otherwise eligible any investment in residual interests of a cmo that has elected to be treated as a remic can create complex tax problems especially if the fund has state or local governments or other taxexempt organizations as shareholders under current law the fund serves to block ubti from being realized by its taxexempt shareholders notwithstanding the foregoing a taxexempt shareholder will recognize ubti by virtue of its investment in the fund if shares in the fund constitute debtfinanced property in the hands of the taxexempt shareholder within the meaning of section b of the code furthermore a taxexempt shareholder may recognize ubti if the fund recognizes “excess inclusion income” derived from direct or indirect investments in remic residual interests or tmps if the amount of such income recognized by the fund exceeds the fund’s investment company taxable income after taking into account deductions for dividends paid by the fund in addition special tax consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts “crts” that invest in regulated investment companies that invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in remics or in tmps under legislation enacted in december  a crt as defined in section  of the code that realizes ubti for a taxable year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such ubti under irs guidance issued in october  a crt will not recognize ubti solely as a result of investing in a fund that recognizes “excess inclusion income” rather if at any time during any taxable year a crt or one of certain other taxexempt shareholders such as the us a state or political subdivision or an agency or instrumentality thereof and certain energy cooperatives is a record holder of a share in a fund that recognizes “excess inclusion income” then the fund will be subject to a tax on that portion of its “excess inclusion income” for the taxable year that is allocable to such shareholders at the highest federal corporate income tax rate the extent to which this irs guidance remains applicable in light of the december  legislation is unclear to the extent permitted under the  act each fund may elect to specially allocate any such tax to the applicable crt or other shareholder and thus reduce such shareholder’s distributions for the year by the amount of the tax that relates to such shareholder’s interest in the fund the funds have not yet determined whether such an election will be made crts are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences of investing in a fund if a fund invests in pfics certain special tax consequences may apply a pfic is any foreign corporation in which i  or more of the gross income for the taxable year is passive income or ii the average percentage of   part ii   the assets generally by value but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least  generally passive income for this purpose includes dividends interest including income equivalent to interest royalties rents annuities the excess of gains over losses from certain property transactions and commodities transactions and foreign currency gains passive income for this purpose does not include rents and royalties received by the foreign corporation from active business and certain income received from related persons a fund’s investments in certain pfics could subject the fund to a us federal income tax including interest charges on distributions received from the company or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the company this tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders in addition certain interest charges may be imposed on the fund as a result of such distributions if a fund is in a position to treat a pfic as a “qualified electing fund” “qef” the fund will be required to include in its gross income its share of the company’s income and net capital gain annually regardless of whether it receives any distributions from the company alternately a fund may make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in such holdings “to the market” as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the fund’s taxable year such gain and loss are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may have the effect of accelerating the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increasing the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the fund’s total return a fund that invests indirectly in pfics by virtue of the fund’s investment in other investment companies that qualify as “us persons” within the meaning of the code may not make a qef election rather such underlying investment companies investing directly in the pfics would decide whether to make such election dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income” certain funds have whollyowned subsidiaries organized under the laws of the cayman islands which are classified as corporations for us federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary” with respect to such funds a fund may invest a portion of its assets in its subsidiary a foreign corporation such as a subsidiary will generally not be subject to us federal income taxation unless it is deemed to be engaged in a us trade or business it is expected that each subsidiary will conduct its activities in a manner so as to meet the requirements of a safe harbor provided under section b of the code under which the subsidiary may engage in trading in stocks or securities or certain commodities without being deemed to be engaged in a us trade or business however if certain of a subsidiary’s activities were determined not to be of the type described in the safe harbor which is not expected then the activities of the subsidiary may constitute a us trade or business and subject to us taxation as such in general a foreign corporation such as a subsidiary that does not conduct a us trade or business is nonetheless subject to tax at a flat rate of  percent or lower tax treaty rate generally payable through withholding on the gross amount of certain ussource income that is not effectively connected with a us trade or business there is presently no tax treaty in force between the us and the cayman islands that would reduce this rate of withholding tax it is not expected that a subsidiary will derive meaningful income subject to such withholding tax each subsidiary will be treated as a controlled foreign corporation “cfc” and the fund investing in its subsidiary will be treated as a “us shareholder” of that subsidiary as a result a fund will be required to include in gross income for us federal income tax purposes all of its subsidiary’s “subpart f income” whether or not such income is distributed by the subsidiary it is expected that all of the subsidiary’s income will be “subpart f income” a fund’s recognition of its subsidiary’s “subpart f income” will increase the fund’s tax basis in the subsidiary distributions by the subsidiary to a fund will be taxfree to the extent of its previously undistributed “subpart f income” and will correspondingly reduce the fund’s tax basis in the subsidiary “subpart f income” is generally treated as ordinary income regardless of the character of the subsidiary’s underlying income if a net loss is realized by the subsidiary such loss is not generally available to offset the income earned by a fund and such loss cannot be carried forward to offset taxable income of a fund or the subsidiary in future periods the irs recently issued proposed regulations that if finalized would generally treat a fund’s income inclusion with respect to a subsidiary as qualifying income only if there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the subsidiary that are attributable to such income inclusion the proposed regulations if adopted would apply to the fund’s taxable years beginning on or after  days after the regulations are published as final the ability of a fund to invest directly in commodities and in certain commodityrelated securities and other instruments is subject to significant limitations in order to enable a fund to maintain its status as a regulated investment company under the code   part ii   investment in other funds if a fund invests in shares of other mutual funds etfs or other companies that are taxable as regulated investment companies as well as certain investments in reits collectively “underlying funds” its distributable income and gains will normally consist in part of distributions from the underlying funds and gains and losses on the disposition of shares of the underlying funds to the extent that an underlying fund realizes net losses on its investments for a given taxable year the fund will not be able to recognize its share of those losses so as to offset distributions of net income or capital gains from other underlying funds until it disposes of shares of the underlying fund moreover even when the fund does make such a disposition a portion of its loss may be recognized as a longterm capital loss which will not be treated as favorably for federal income tax purposes as a shortterm capital loss or an ordinary deduction in particular the fund will not be able to offset any capital losses from its dispositions of underlying fund shares against its ordinary income including distributions of any net shortterm capital gain realized by an underlying fund in addition in certain circumstances the “wash sale” rules under section  of the code may apply to a fund’s sales of underlying fund shares that have generated losses a wash sale occurs if shares of an underlying fund are sold by the fund at a loss and the fund acquires substantially identical shares of that same underlying fund  days before or after the date of the sale the washsale rules could defer losses in the fund’s hands on sales of underlying fund shares to the extent such sales are wash sales for extended and in certain cases potentially indefinite periods of time as a result of the foregoing rules and certain other special rules the amount of net investment income and net capital gain that each fund will be required to distribute to shareholders may be greater than what such amounts would have been had the fund directly invested in the securities held by the underlying funds rather than investing in shares of the underlying funds for similar reasons the character of distributions from the fund eg longterm capital gain exempt interest eligibility for dividendsreceived deduction etc will not necessarily be the same as it would have been had the fund invested directly in the securities held by the underlying funds if a fund received dividends from an underlying fund that qualifies as a regulated investment company and the underlying fund designates such dividends as “qualified dividend income” then the fund is permitted in turn to designate a portion of its distributions as “qualified dividend income” provided the fund meets holding period and other requirements with respect to shares of the underlying fund depending on a fund’s percentage ownership in an underlying fund both before and after a redemption a redemption of shares of an underlying fund by a fund may cause the fund to be treated as receiving a section  distribution taxable as a dividend under section  of the code to the extent of its allocable shares of earnings and profits on the full amount of the distribution instead of receiving capital gain income on the shares of the underlying fund such a distribution may be treated as qualified dividend income and thus eligible to be taxed at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain if qualified dividend income treatment is not available the distribution may be taxed as ordinary income this could cause shareholders of the fund to recognize higher amounts of ordinary income than if the shareholders had held the shares of the underlying funds directly a fund may elect to pass through to shareholders foreign tax credits from an underlying fund and exemptinterest dividends from an underlying fund provided that at least  of the fund’s total assets are invested in other regulated investment companies at the end of each quarter of the taxable year backup withholding each fund generally is required to backup withhold and remit to the us treasury a percentage of the taxable dividends and other distributions paid to and the proceeds of share sales exchanges or redemptions made by any individual shareholder who fails to properly furnish the fund with a correct taxpayer identification number “tin” who has underreported dividend or interest income or who fails to certify to the fund that he or she is not subject to backup withholding the backup withholding rules may also apply to distributions that are properly designated as exemptinterest dividends the backup withholding tax rate is  foreign shareholders shares of the funds have not been registered for sale outside of the united states this sai is not intended for distribution to prospective investors outside of the united states the funds generally do not market or sell shares to investors domiciled outside of the united states even with regard to individuals if they are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the united states distributions properly designated as capital gain dividends and exemptinterest dividends generally will not be subject to withholding of federal income tax however exemptinterest dividends may be subject to backup   part ii   withholding as discussed above in general dividends other than capital gain dividends and exemptinterest dividends paid by a fund to a shareholder that is not a “us person” within the meaning of the code a “foreign person” are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate even if they are funded by income or gains such as portfolio interest shortterm capital gains or foreignsource dividend and interest income that if paid to a foreign person directly would not be subject to withholding however the fund will not be required to withhold any amounts i with respect to distributions other than distributions to a foreign person w that has not provided a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner is not a us person x to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign person is the issuer or is a  shareholder of the issuer y that is within certain foreign countries that have inadequate information exchange with the united states or z to the extent the dividend is attributable to interest paid by a person that is a related person of the foreign person and the foreign person is a controlled foreign corporation from ussource interest income of types similar to those not subject to us federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign person to the extent such distributions are properly designated by the fund “interestrelated dividends” and ii with respect to distributions other than a distributions to an individual foreign person who is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the distribution and b distributions subject to special rules regarding the disposition of us real property interests as described below of net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses to the extent such distributions are properly designated by the fund “shortterm capital gain dividends” depending on the circumstances a fund may make designations of interestrelated andor shortterm capital gain dividends with respect to all some or none of its potentially eligible dividends andor treat such dividends in whole or in part as ineligible for these exemptions from withholding in the case of shares held through an intermediary the intermediary may withhold even if a fund makes a designation with respect to a payment foreign persons should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts a beneficial holder of shares who is a foreign person is not in general subject to us federal income tax on gains and is not allowed a deduction for losses realized on the sale of shares of the fund or on capital gain dividends or exemptinterest dividends unless i such gain or dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business carried on by such holder within the united states or ii in the case of an individual holder the holder is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of the capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met or iii the shares constitute “us real property interests” “usrpis” or the capital gain dividends are attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of usrpis in accordance with the rules set forth below special rules apply to distributions to foreign shareholders from a fund that is either a “us real property holding corporation” “usrphc” or would be a usrphc but for the operation of the exceptions to the definition thereof described below additionally special rules apply to the sale of shares in a fund that is a usrphc very generally a usrphc is a domestic corporation that holds us real property interests “usrpis” — usrpis are defined as any interest in us real property or any equity interest in a usrphc — the fair market value of which equals or exceeds  of the sum of the fair market values of the corporation’s usrpis interests in real property located outside the united states and certain other assets a fund that holds directly or indirectly significant interests in reits may be a usrphc the special rules discussed in the next paragraph will also generally apply to distributions from a fund that would be a usrphc absent exclusions from usrpi treatment for interests in domestically controlled reits or regulated investment companies and notgreaterthan interests in publicly traded classes of stock in reits or regulated investment companies in the case of a fund that is a usrphc or would be a usrphc but for the exceptions from the definition of usrpi described immediately above distributions by the fund that are attributable to a gains realized on the disposition of usrpis by the fund and b distributions received by the fund from a lowertier regulated investment company or reit that the fund is required to treat as usrpi gain in its hands will retain their character as gains realized from usrpis in the hands of the fund’s foreign shareholders if the foreign shareholder holds or has held in the prior year more than a  interest in the fund such distributions will be treated as gains “effectively connected” with the conduct of a “us trade or business” and subject to tax at graduated rates moreover such shareholders will be required to file a us income tax return for the year in which the gain was recognized and the fund will be required to withhold  of the amount of such distribution in the case of all other foreign shareholders ie those whose interest in the fund did not exceed  at any time during the prior year the usrpi distribution will be treated as ordinary income regardless of any designation by the fund that such distribution is a shortterm capital gain dividend or a capital gain dividend and the fund must withhold  or a lower applicable treaty rate of the amount of the distribution paid to such foreign shareholder foreign shareholders of a fund are also subject to “wash sale” rules to prevent the avoidance of the taxfiling and payment obligations discussed above through the sale and repurchase of fund shares   part ii   in addition a fund that is a usrphc must typically withhold  of the amount realized in a redemption by a greaterthan foreign shareholder and that shareholder must file a us income tax return for the year of the disposition of the usrpi and pay any additional tax due on the gain no withholding is generally required with respect to amounts paid in redemption of shares of a fund if the fund is a domestically controlled usrphc or in certain limited cases if the fund whether or not domestically controlled holds substantial investments in regulated investment companies that are domestically controlled usrphcs in order to qualify for any exemptions from withholding described above or for lower withholding tax rates under income tax treaties or to establish an exemption from backup withholding the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing requirements relating to its nonus status including in general furnishing an applicable irs form w or substitute form foreign investors in a fund should consult their tax advisers in this regard if a shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to us federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the shareholder in the united states a beneficial holder of shares who is a foreign person may be subject to state and local tax and to the us federal estate tax in addition to the federal tax on income referred to above foreign shareholders in a fund should consult their tax advisors with respect to the potential application of the above rules a fund is required to withhold us tax at a  rate on payments of taxable dividends and effective january   redemption proceeds and certain capital gain dividends made to certain nonus entities that fail to comply or be deemed compliant with extensive new reporting and withholding requirements designed to inform the us department of the treasury of usowned foreign investment accounts shareholders may be requested to provide additional information to a fund to enable the fund to determine whether withholding is required foreign taxes certain funds may be subject to foreign withholding taxes or other foreign taxes with respect to income possibly including in some cases capital gain received from sources within foreign countries tax conventions between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes if more than  of a fund’s assets at year end consists of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portion of qualified taxes paid by the fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities the fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the code in such a case shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes a shareholder’s ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of foreign taxes paid by a fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the code and the treasury regulations issued thereunder as a result of which a shareholder may not get a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes in particular shareholders must hold their fund shares without protection from risk of loss on the exdividend date and for at least  additional days during the day period surrounding the exdividend date to be eligible to claim a foreign tax credit with respect to a given dividend shareholders who do not itemize on their federal income tax returns may claim a credit but no deduction for such foreign taxes if a fund does not make the above election or if more than  of its assets at the end of the year do not consist of securities of foreign corporations the fund’s net income will be reduced by the foreign taxes paid or withheld in such cases shareholders will not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to foreign taxes the foregoing is only a general description of the treatment of foreign source income or foreign taxes under the us federal income tax laws because the availability of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each shareholder shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors exemptinterest dividends some of the funds intend to qualify to pay exemptinterest dividends to their respective shareholders in order to qualify to pay exemptinterest dividends at least  of the value of a fund’s total assets must consist of taxexempt municipal bonds at the close of each quarter of the fund’s taxable year an exemptinterest dividend is that part of a dividend that is properly designated as an exemptinterest dividend and that consists of interest received by a fund on such taxexempt securities shareholders of funds that pay exemptinterest dividends would not incur any regular federal income tax on the amount of exemptinterest dividends received by them from a fund but an investment in such a fund may result in liability for federal and state alternative minimum taxation and may be subject to state and local taxes   part ii   interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a shareholder whether a corporation or an individual to purchase or carry shares of a fund is not deductible to the extent it relates to exemptinterest dividends received by the shareholder from that fund any loss incurred on the sale or redemption of a fund’s shares held for six months or less may be disallowed to the extent of exemptinterest dividends received with respect to such shares interest on certain taxexempt bonds that are private activity bonds within the meaning of the code is treated as a tax preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and any such interest received by a fund and distributed to shareholders will be so treated for purposes of any alternative minimum tax liability of shareholders to the extent of the dividend’s proportionate share of a fund’s income consisting of such interest all exemptinterest dividends are subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax the exemption from federal income tax for exemptinterest dividends does not necessarily result in exemption for such dividends under the income or other tax laws of any state or local authority shareholders that receive social security or railroad retirement benefits should consult their tax advisors to determine what effect if any an investment in a fund may have on the federal taxation of their benefits from time to time legislation may be introduced or litigation may arise that would change the tax treatment of exemptinterest dividends such legislation or litigation may have the effect of raising the state or other taxes payable by shareholders on such dividends shareholders should consult their tax advisors for the current federal state and local law on exemptinterest dividends state and local tax matters depending on the residence of the shareholders for tax purposes distributions may also be subject to state and local taxation rules of state and local taxation regarding qualified dividend income ordinary income dividends and capital gain dividends from regulated investment companies may differ from the rules of us federal income tax in many respects shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the consequences of these and other state and local tax rules affecting investment in the funds most states provide that a regulated investment company may pass through without restriction to its shareholders state and local income tax exemptions available to direct owners of certain types of us government securities such as us treasury obligations thus for residents of these states distributions derived from a fund’s investment in certain types of us government securities should be free from state and local income taxation to the extent that the interest income from such investments would have been exempt from state and local taxes if such securities had been held directly by the respective shareholders certain states however do not allow a regulated investment company to pass through to its shareholders the state and local income tax exemptions available to direct owners of certain types of us government securities unless a fund holds at least a required amount of us government securities accordingly for residents of these states distributions derived from a fund’s investment in certain types of us government securities may not be entitled to the exemptions from state and local income taxes that would be available if the shareholders had purchased us government securities directly the exemption from state and local income taxes does not preclude states from asserting other taxes on the ownership of us government securities to the extent that a fund invests to a substantial degree in us government securities which are subject to favorable state and local tax treatment shareholders of the fund will be notified as to the extent to which distributions from the fund are attributable to interest on such securities tax shelter reporting regulations if a shareholder realizes a loss on disposition of a fund’s shares of  million or more for an individual shareholder or  million or more for a corporate shareholder the shareholder must file with the internal revenue service a disclosure statement on form  direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all regulated investment companies the fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances general considerations the federal income tax discussion set forth above is for general information only prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the specific federal tax consequences of purchasing holding and disposing of shares of each of the funds as well as the effects of state local and foreign tax law and any proposed tax law changes   part ii   trustees the names of the trustees of the trusts

jpmim jpmim andor its affiliates the “affiliates” and together “jpmorgan” provide an array of discretionary and nondiscretionary investment management services and products to institutional clients and individual investors in addition jpmorgan is a diversified financial services firm that provides a broad range of services and products to its clients and is a major participant in the global currency equity commodity fixedincome and other markets in which a fund invests or will invest investors should carefully review the following which describes potential and actual conflicts of interest that jpmorgan can face in the operation of its investment management services jpmorgan and the funds have adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to appropriately prevent limit or mitigate the conflicts of interest described below in addition many of the activities that create these conflicts of interest are limited andor prohibited by law unless an exception is available this section is not and is not intended to be a complete enumeration or explanation of all of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise additional information about potential conflicts of interest regarding jpmim and jpmorgan is set forth in jpmim’s form adv a copy of part  and part a of jpmim’s and each other adviser’s or subadviser’s form adv is available on the sec’s website wwwadviserinfosecgov acting for multiple clients in general jpmim faces conflicts of interest when it renders investment advisory services to several clients and from time to time provides dissimilar investment advice to different clients for example when funds or accounts managed by jpmim “other accounts” engage in short sales of the same securities held by a fund jpmim could be seen as harming the performance of a fund for the benefit of the other accounts engaging in short sales if the short sales cause the market value of the securities to fall in addition a conflict could arise when one or more other accounts invest in different instruments or classes of securities of the same issuer than those in which a fund invests in certain circumstances other accounts have different investment objectives or could pursue or enforce rights with respect to a particular issuer in which a fund has also invested and these activities could have an adverse effect on the fund for example if a fund holds debt instruments of an issuer and an other account holds equity securities of the same issuer then if the issuer experiences financial or operational challenges the fund which holds the debt instrument may seek a liquidation of the issuer whereas the other account which holds the equity securities may prefer a reorganization of the issuer in addition an issuer in which the fund invests may use the proceeds of the fund’s investment to refinance or reorganize its capital structure which could result in repayment of debt held by jpmorgan or an other account if the issuer performs poorly following such refinancing or reorganization the fund’s results will suffer whereas the other account’s performance will not be affected because the other account no longer has an investment in the issuer conflicts are magnified with respect to issuers that become insolvent it is possible that in connection with an insolvency bankruptcy reorganization or similar proceeding a fund will be limited by applicable law courts or otherwise in the positions or actions it will be permitted to take due to other interests held or actions or positions taken by jpmorgan or other accounts positions taken by other accounts may also dilute or otherwise negatively affect the values prices or investment strategies associated with positions held by a fund for example this may occur when investment decisions for the fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support portfolio decisions by jpmim for other accounts following different investment strategies or by affiliates in managing their clients’ accounts when an other account or an account managed by an affiliate implements a portfolio decision or strategy ahead of or contemporaneously with similar portfolio decisions or strategies for a fund whether or not the portfolio decisions emanate from the same research analysis or other information market impact liquidity constraints or other factors could result in the fund receiving less favorable investment results and the costs of implementing such portfolio decisions or strategies could be increased or the fund could otherwise be disadvantaged investment opportunities that are appropriate for a fund may also be appropriate for other accounts and there is no assurance the fund will receive an allocation of all or a portion of those investments it wishes to pursue jpmim’s management of an other account that pays it a performance fee or a higher management fee and follows the same or similar strategy as a fund or invests in substantially similar assets as a fund creates an incentive for jpmim to favor the account paying it the potentially higher fee eg in placing securities trades       the affiliates of jpmim that act as adviser or subadviser to a fund – security capital research  management incorporated jp morgan alternative asset management inc jf international management inc and jp morgan private investments inc—will also face some or all of the conflicts of interest described in this section references to jpmim should be read to apply to these other advisers for a fund advised or subadvised by such other adviser   part ii   jpmim and its affiliates and any of their directors officers or employees also buy sell or trade securities for their own accounts or the proprietary accounts of jpmim andor an affiliate jpmim or its affiliates within their discretion may make different investment decisions and take other actions with respect to their own proprietary accounts than those made for client accounts including the timing or nature of such investment decisions or actions further jpmim is not required to purchase or sell for any client account securities that it an affiliate or any of its or their employees may purchase or sell for their own accounts or the proprietary accounts of jpmim or an affiliate or its clients jpmim its affiliates and their respective directors officers and employees face a conflict of interest as they will have income or other incentives to favor their own accounts or proprietary accounts the portfolio managers of certain fundsoffunds have access to the holdings and may have knowledge of the investment strategies and techniques of certain underlying funds because they are portfolio managers of separately managed accounts following similar strategies as a fundoffunds they therefore face conflicts of interest in the timing and amount of allocations to an underlying fund as well as in the choice of an underlying fund jpmorgan also faces conflicts of interest when waiving certain fees if those waivers enhance performance the chart in part i of this sai entitled “portfolio managers’ other accounts managed” shows the number type and market value as of a specified date of the accounts and other funds managed by each fund’s excluding the money market funds’ portfolio managers acting in multiple commercial capacities jpmorgan is a diversified financial services firm that provides a broad range of services and products to its clients and is a major participant in the global currency equity commodity fixedincome and other markets in which a fund invests or may invest jpmorgan is typically entitled to compensation in connection with these activities and the funds will not be entitled to any such compensation in providing services and products to clients other than the funds jpmorgan from time to time faces conflicts of interest with respect to activities recommended to or performed for a fund on one hand and for jpmorgan’s other clients on the other hand for example jpmorgan has and continues to seek to develop banking and other financial and advisory relationships with numerous us and nonus persons and governments jpmorgan also advises and represents potential buyers and sellers of businesses worldwide the funds have invested in or may wish to invest in such entities represented by jpmorgan or with which jpmorgan has a banking or other financial relationship in addition certain clients of jpmorgan may invest in entities in which jpmorgan holds an interest including a fund in providing services to its clients jpmorgan from time to time recommends activities that compete with or otherwise adversely affect a fund or the fund’s investments it should be recognized that such relationships may also preclude the fund from engaging in certain transactions and may constrain the fund’s investment flexibility for example affiliates that are broker dealers cannot deal with the funds as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless an exemptive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the sec certain of the funds have received exemptive orders permitting the funds to engage in principal transactions with affiliates involving taxable and tax exempt money market instruments however for the purchase and sale of longer term fixed income securities which are generally principal transactions the funds cannot use broker dealer affiliates or if an affiliate is the sole underwriter of an initial or secondary offering the funds could not purchase in the offering in both cases the number of securities and counterparties available to the funds will be fewer than are available to mutual funds that are not affiliated with major broker dealers jpmorgan derives ancillary benefits from providing investment advisory custody administration fund accounting and shareholder servicing and other services to the funds and providing such services to the funds may enhance jpmorgan’s relationships with various parties facilitate additional business development and enable jpmorgan to obtain additional business and generate additional revenue participations adverse to the funds jpmorgan’s participation in certain markets or its actions for certain clients may also restrict or affect a fund’s ability to transact in those markets and jpmorgan may face conflicts with respect to the interests involved for example when a fund and another jpmorgan client invest in different parts of an issuer’s capital structure decisions over whether to trigger an event of default over the terms of any workout or how to exit an investment implicate conflicts of interest see also “acting for multiple clients” preferential treatment jpmim receives more compensation with respect to certain funds or other accounts than it receives with respect to a fund or receives compensation based in part on the performance of certain accounts this creates a conflict of interest for jpmim and its portfolio managers by providing an incentive to favor those accounts actual or potential conflicts of interest also arise when a portfolio manager has management responsibilities to more than one account or fund such as devotion of unequal time and attention to the management of the funds or accounts   part ii   allocation and aggregation potential conflicts of interest also arise with both the aggregation of trade orders and allocation of securities transactions or investment opportunities allocations of aggregated trades particularly trade orders that were only partially filled due to limited availability and allocation of investment opportunities raise a potential conflict of interest because jpmorgan has an incentive to allocate trades or investment opportunities to certain accounts or funds for example jpmorgan has an incentive to cause accounts it manages to participate in an offering where such participation could increase jpmorgan’s overall allocation of securities in that offering when jpmorgan serves as adviser to the funds as well as certain fundsoffunds it faces certain potential conflicts of interest when allocating the assets of the fundsoffunds among its underlying funds for example jpmorgan has an incentive to allocate assets of the fundoffunds to seed a new fund or to allocate to an underlying fund that is small pays higher fees to jpmorgan or to which jpmorgan has provided seed capital overall position limits potential conflicts of interest also exist when jpmorgan maintains certain overall investment limitations on positions in securities or other financial instruments due to among other things investment restrictions imposed upon jpmorgan by law regulation contract or internal policies these limitations have precluded and in the future could preclude a fund from purchasing particular securities or financial instruments even if the securities or financial instruments would otherwise meet the fund’s objectives for example there are limits on the aggregate amount of investments by affiliated investors in certain types of securities that may not be exceeded without additional regulatory or corporate consent there also are limits on the writing of options by a fund that could be triggered based on the number of options written by jpmim on behalf of other investment advisory clients if certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached or certain transactions are undertaken the ability of a fund to purchase or dispose of investments or exercise rights or undertake business transactions will be restricted soft dollars jpmim pays certain brokerdealers with “soft” or commission dollars generated by client brokerage transactions in exchange for access to statistical information and other research services jpmim faces conflicts of interest because the statistical information and other research services may benefit certain other clients of jpmim more than a fund and can be used in connection with the management of accounts other than the accounts whose trades generated the commissions additionally when jpmim uses client brokerage commissions to obtain statistical information and other research services jpmim receives a benefit because it does not have to produce or pay for the information or other research services itself as a result jpmim may have an incentive to select a particular brokerdealer in order to obtain such information and other research services from that brokerdealer rather than to obtain the lowest price for execution redemptions jpmorgan as a seed investor jpmorgan funds of funds and jpmorgan on behalf of its discretionary clients have significant ownership in certain funds jpmorgan faces conflicts of interest when considering the effect of redemptions on such funds and on other shareholders in deciding whether and when to redeem its shares a large redemption of shares by jpmorgan by a jpmorgan fund of funds or by jpmorgan acting on behalf of its discretionary clients could result in the fund selling securities when it otherwise would not have done so accelerating the realization of capital gains and increasing transaction costs a large redemption could significantly reduce the assets of a fund causing decreased liquidity and depending on any applicable expense caps a higher expense ratio affiliated transactions the funds are subject to conflicts of interest if they engage in principal or agency transactions with other funds or with jpmorgan to the extent permitted by law the funds can enter into transactions in which jpmorgan acts as principal on its own behalf principal transactions advises both sides of a transaction cross transactions and acts as broker for and receives a commission from the funds agency transactions principal and agency transactions create the opportunity for jpmorgan to engage in selfdealing jpmorgan faces a conflict of interest when it engages in a principal or agency transaction on behalf of a fund because such transactions result in additional compensation to jpmorgan jpmorgan faces a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in these transactions in addition affiliates of jpmim have direct or indirect interests in electronic communication networks and alternative trading systems collectively “ecns” jpmim in accordance with its fiduciary obligation to seek to obtain best execution from time to time executes client trades through ecns in which an affiliate has or may acquire an interest in such case the affiliate will be indirectly compensated based upon its ownership percentage in relation to the transaction fees charged by the ecns jpmorgan also faces conflicts of interest if a fund purchases securities during the existence of an underwriting syndicate for such securities of which jpmorgan is a member because jpmorgan typically receives fees for certain   part ii   services that it provides to the syndicate and in certain cases will be relieved directly or indirectly of certain financial obligations as a result of a fund’s purchase of securities affiliated service providers jpmorgan faces conflicts of interest when the funds use service providers affiliated with jpmorgan because jpmorgan receives greater overall fees when they are used affiliates provide investment advisory custody administration fund accounting and shareholder servicing services to the funds for which they are compensated by the funds similarly jpmim faces a conflict of interest if it decides to use or negotiate the terms of a credit facility for a fund if the facility is provided by an affiliate in addition in selecting actively managed underlying funds for jpmorgan funds of funds jpmim limits its selection to funds in the jpmorgan family of mutual funds jpmim does not consider or canvass the universe of unaffiliated investment companies available even though there may be unaffiliated investment companies that may be more appropriate for the jpmorgan fund of funds or that have superior returns the jpmorgan affiliates providing services to the funds benefit from additional fees when a fund is included as an underlying fund in a jpmorgan fund of funds proxy voting potential conflicts of interest can arise when jpmim votes proxies for securities held by a fund a conflict is deemed to exist when the proxy is for jpmorgan chase  co stock or for jp morgan funds or when the proxy administrator has actual knowledge indicating that an affiliate is an investment banker or rendered a fairness opinion with respect to the matter that is the subject of the proxy vote when such conflicts are identified the proxy will be voted by an independent third party either in accordance with jpmim’s proxy voting guidelines or by the third party using its own guidelines potential conflicts of interest can arise when jpmim invests fund assets in securities of companies that are also clients of jpmim or that have material business relationships with jpmim or an affiliate and a vote against management could harm or otherwise affect jpmim’s or the affiliate’s business relationship with that company see the proxy voting section in this sai lending jpmorgan faces conflicts of interest with respect to interfund lending or the jpmorgan chase bank na credit facility which could harm the lending or the borrowing fund if jpmorgan favors one fund’s or jpmorgan’s interests over those of another fund if a fund engages in securities lending transactions jpmim faces a conflict of interest when a jpmim affiliate operates as a service provider in the securities lending transaction or otherwise receives compensation as part of the securities lending activities personal trading jpmorgan and any of its directors officers agents or employees face conflicts of interest when transacting in securities for their own accounts because they could benefit by trading in the same securities as a fund which could have an adverse effect on a fund valuation jpmim acting in its capacity as the funds’ administrator is the primary valuation agent of the funds jpmim values securities and assets in the funds according to the funds’ valuation policies from time to time jpmim will value an asset differently than an affiliate values the identical asset including because the affiliate has information regarding valuation techniques and models or other information that it does not share with jpmim this arises particularly in connection with securities or other assets for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations do not represent the value at the time of pricing eg startup companies and which are fair valued jpmim will also face a conflict with respect to valuations as they affect the amount of jpmim’s compensation as investment adviser and administrator information access as a result of jpmorgan’s various other businesses affiliates from time to time comes into possession of information about certain markets and investments which if known to jpmim could cause jpmim to seek to dispose of retain or increase interests in investments held by a fund or acquire certain positions on behalf of a fund however jpmorgan’s internal information barriers restrict jpmim’s ability to access such information even when it would be relevant to its management of the funds such affiliates can trade differently from the funds potentially based on information not available to jpmim if jpmim acquires or is deemed to acquire material nonpublic information regarding an issuer jpmim will be restricted from purchasing or selling securities of that issuer for its clients including a fund until the information has been publicly disclosed or is no longer deemed material such an issuer could include an underlying fund in a fundoffunds gifts and entertainment from time to time employees of jpmim receive gifts andor entertainment from clients intermediaries or service providers to the funds or jpmim which could have the appearance of affecting or may potentially affect the judgment of the employees or the manner in which they conduct business for funds with subadvisers additional potential conflicts of interest the advisers to certain funds have engaged affiliated andor unaffiliated subadvisers the adviser compensates subadvisers out of the advisory fees it receives from the fund which creates an incentive for the   part ii   adviser to select subadvisers with lower fee rates or to select affiliated subadvisers in addition the subadvisers have interests and relationships that create actual or potential conflicts of interest related to their management of the assets of the funds allocated to such subadvisers such conflicts of interest may be similar to different from or supplement those conflicts described herein relating to jpmorgan for example in the case of the jpmorgan multimanager alternatives fund jpmorgan alternative asset management inc “jpmaam” its investment adviser primarily acts as a manager of managers in respect of that fund and other funds it advises because the subadvisers engage in direct trading strategies for the fund assets allocated to them the subadvisers have potential conflicts of interest related to the investment of client assets in securities and other instruments that would not apply to jpmaam unless jpmaam is also engaging in direct trading strategies or could apply to jpmaam in a different or more limited manner such potential conflicts relate to the subadvisers’ trading and investment practices including but not limited to their selection of brokerdealers aggregation of orders for multiple clients or netting of orders for the same client and the investment of client assets in companies in which they have an interest additional information about potential conflicts of interest regarding the subadvisers is set forth in each subadviser’s form adv a copy of part  and part  of each subadviser’s form adv is available on the sec’s website wwwadviserinfosecgov for details of the dollar range of shares of each fund excluding the money market funds beneficially owned by the portfolio managers see “portfolio managers — ownership of securities” in part i of this sai portfolio manager compensation jpmorgan’s portfolio managers participate in a competitive compensation program that is designed to attract retain and motivate talented people and closely link the performance of investment professionals to client investment objectives jpmorgan manages compensation on a total compensation basis the components being base salary fixed from year to year and a variable discretionary incentive award base salaries are reviewed annually and awarded based on individual performance and business results taking into account level and scope of position experience and market competitiveness the variable discretionary performance based incentive award consists of cash incentives and deferred compensation which includes mandatory notional investments as described below in selected mutual funds advised by jpmorgan or its affiliates “mandatory investment plan” these elements reflect individual performance and the performance of jpmorgan’s business as a whole each portfolio manager’s performance is formally evaluated annually based on a variety of factors including the aggregate size and blended performance of the portfolios such portfolio manager manages individual contribution relative to client risk and return objectives and adherence with jpmorgan’s compliance risk and regulatory procedures in evaluating each portfolio manager’s performance with respect to the mutual funds he or she manages the pretax performance of the funds or the portion of the funds managed by the portfolio manager is compared to the appropriate market peer group and to competitive indices jpmorgan has identified for the investment strategy over one three and five year periods or such shorter time as the portfolio manager has managed the funds investment performance is generally more heavily weighted to the longterm deferred compensation granted as part of an employee’s annual incentive compensation comprises from  to  of a portfolio manager’s total performance based incentive as the level of incentive compensation increases the percentage of compensation awarded in deferred incentives also increases jpmorgan’s portfolio managers are required to notionally invest a certain percentage of their deferred compensation typically  to  depending on the level of compensation into the selected funds they manage the remaining portion of the noncash incentive is elective and may be notionally invested in any of the other mutual funds available in the mandatory investment plan or will take the form of a jpmorgan in restricted stock unit award when these awards vest over time the portfolio manager receives cash equal to the market value of the notional investment in the selected mutual funds or shares of jpmorgan common stock codes of ethics the trusts the advisers and jpmds have each adopted codes of ethics pursuant to rule j under the  act and pursuant to rule a under the advisers act with respect to the advisers the trusts’ code of ethics includes policies which require “access persons” as defined in rule j to i place the interest of trust shareholders first ii conduct personal securities transactions in a manner that avoids any actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse of a position of trust and responsibility and iii refrain from taking inappropriate advantage of his or her position with the trusts or a fund the trusts’ code of ethics prohibits any access person from i employing any device scheme or artifice to defraud the trusts or a fund ii making to   part ii   the trusts or a fund any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state to the trusts or a fund a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading iii engaging in any act practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the trusts or a fund or iv engaging in any manipulative practice with respect to the trusts or a fund the trusts’ code of ethics permits personnel subject to the code to invest in securities including securities that may be purchased or held by a fund so long as such investment transactions are not in contravention of the above noted policies and prohibitions the code of ethics adopted by the advisers requires that all employees must i place the interest of the accounts which are managed by the adviser first ii conduct all personal securities transactions in a manner that is consistent with the code of ethics and the individual employee’s position of trust and responsibility and iii refrain from taking inappropriate advantage of their position employees of each adviser are also prohibited from certain mutual fund trading activity including excessive trading of shares of a mutual fund as described in the applicable fund’s prospectuses or sai and effecting or facilitating a mutual fund transaction to engage in market timing the advisers’ code of ethics permits personnel subject to the code to invest in securities including securities that may be purchased or held by a fund subject to certain restrictions however all employees are required to preclear securities trades except for certain types of securities such as nonproprietary mutual fund shares and us government securities each of the adviser’s affiliated subadvisers has also adopted the code of ethics described above jpmds’s code of ethics requires that all employees of jpmds must i place the interest of the accounts which are managed by affiliates of jpmds first ii conduct all personal securities transactions in a manner that is consistent with the code of ethics and the individual employee’s position of trust and responsibility and iii refrain from taking inappropriate advantage of their positions employees of jpmds are also prohibited from certain mutual fund trading activity including excessive trading of shares of a mutual fund as such term is defined in the applicable fund’s prospectuses or sai or effecting or facilitating a mutual fund transaction to engage in market timing jpmds’s code of ethics permits personnel subject to the code to invest in securities including securities that may be purchased or held by the funds subject to the policies and restrictions in such code of ethics portfolio transactions investment decisions and portfolio transactions pursuant to the advisory and subadvisory agreements the advisers determine subject to the general supervision of the board of trustees of the trusts and in accordance with each fund’s investment objective and restrictions which securities are to be purchased and sold by each such fund and which brokers are to be eligible to execute its portfolio transactions the advisers operate independently in providing services to their respective clients investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic suitability for the particular client involved thus for example a particular security may be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have been bought or sold for other clients at the same time likewise a particular security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling the security in some instances one client may sell a particular security to another client it also happens that two or more clients may simultaneously buy or sell the same security in which event each day’s transactions in such security are insofar as possible averaged as to price and allocated between such clients in a manner which in the opinion of the adviser is equitable to each and in accordance with the amount being purchased or sold by each there may be circumstances when purchases or sales of portfolio securities for one or more clients will have an adverse effect on other clients brokerage and research services on behalf of the funds a fund’s adviser places orders for all purchases and sales of portfolio securities enters into repurchase agreements and may enter into reverse repurchase agreements and execute loans of portfolio securities on behalf of a fund unless otherwise prohibited see “investment strategies and policies” fixed income and debt securities and municipal bonds and notes are generally traded at a net price with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission the price of the security usually includes profit to the dealers in underwritten offerings securities are purchased at a fixed price which includes an amount of compensation to the underwriter generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount transactions on stock exchanges other than foreign stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers also a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in foreign securities generally involve payment of fixed brokerage commissions which are generally higher than those in the us on occasion certain securities may be purchased directly from an issuer in which case no commissions or discounts are paid   part ii   in connection with portfolio transactions the overriding objective is to obtain the best execution of purchase and sales orders in making this determination the adviser considers a number of factors including but not limited to the price per unit of the security the broker’s execution capabilities the commissions charged the broker’s reliability for prompt accurate confirmations and ontime delivery of securities the brokerdealer firm’s financial condition the broker’s ability to provide access to public offerings as well as the quality of research services provided as permitted by section e of the securities exchange act the adviser may cause the funds to pay a brokerdealer which provides brokerage and research services to the adviser or the funds andor other accounts for which the adviser exercises investment discretion an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for a fund in excess of the amount other brokerdealers would have charged for the transaction if the adviser determines in good faith that the greater commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing brokerdealer viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the adviser’s overall responsibilities to accounts over which it exercises investment discretion not all such services are useful or of value in advising the funds the adviser reports to the board of trustees regarding overall commissions paid by the funds and their reasonableness in relation to the benefits to the funds in accordance with section e of the securities exchange act and consistent with applicable sec guidance and interpretation the term “brokerage and research services” includes i advice as to the value of securities ii the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities iii the availability of securities or of purchasers or sellers of securities iv furnishing analyses and reports concerning issues industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts and v effecting securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance settlement and custody or required by rule or regulation in connection with such transactions brokerage and research services received from such brokerdealers will be in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by an adviser under the advisory agreement or with respect to a subadviser under the subadvisory agreement the fees that the funds pay to the adviser are not reduced as a consequence of the adviser’s receipt of brokerage and research services to the extent the funds’ portfolio transactions are used to obtain such services the brokerage commissions paid by the funds may exceed those that might otherwise be paid by an amount that cannot be presently determined such services generally would be useful and of value to the adviser in serving one or more of its other clients and conversely such services obtained by the placement of brokerage business of other clients generally would be useful to the adviser in carrying out its obligations to the funds while such services are not expected to reduce the expenses of the adviser the adviser would through use of the services avoid the additional expenses that would be incurred if it should attempt to develop comparable information through its own staff subject to the overriding objective of obtaining the best execution of orders the adviser may allocate a portion of a fund’s brokerage transactions to affiliates of the adviser under the  act persons affiliated with a fund and persons who are affiliated with such persons are prohibited from dealing with the fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless an exemptive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the sec the sec has granted exemptive orders permitting each fund to engage in principal transactions with jp morgan securities llc an affiliated broker involving taxable and tax exempt money market instruments including commercial paper banker acceptances and medium term notes and repurchase agreements the orders are subject to certain conditions an affiliated person of a fund may serve as its broker in listed or overthecounter transactions conducted on an agency basis provided that among other things the fee or commission received by such affiliated broker is reasonable and fair compared to the fee or commission received by nonaffiliated brokers in connection with comparable transactions in addition a fund may not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting syndicate for such securities of which jpmorgan chase bank or an affiliate is a member or in a private placement in which jpmorgan chase bank or an affiliate serves as placement agent except pursuant to procedures adopted by the board of trustees that either comply with rules adopted by the sec or with interpretations of the sec’s staff each fund expects to purchase securities from underwriting syndicates of which certain affiliates of jpmorgan chase act as a member or manager such purchases will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in rule f under the  act and related procedures adopted by the trustees including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” of a fund among the conditions are that the issuer of any purchased securities will have been in operation for at least three years that not more than  of the underwriting will be purchased by a fund and all other accounts over which the same investment adviser has discretion and that no shares will be purchased from jpmds or any of its affiliates     part ii   on those occasions when the adviser deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interests of a fund as well as other customers including other funds the adviser to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations may but is not obligated to aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a fund with those to be sold or purchased for other customers in order to obtain best execution including lower brokerage commissions if appropriate in such event allocation of the securities so purchased or sold as well as any expenses incurred in the transaction will be made by the adviser in the manner it considers to be most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to its customers including the funds in some instances the allocation procedure might not permit a fund to participate in the benefits of the aggregated trade if a fund that writes options effects a closing purchase transaction with respect to an option written by it normally such transaction will be executed by the same brokerdealer who executed the sale of the option the writing of options by a fund will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges governing the maximum number of options in each class which may be written by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written on the same or different exchanges or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers the number of options that a fund may write may be affected by options written by the adviser for other investment advisory clients an exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in excess of these limits and it may impose certain other sanctions allocation of transactions including their frequency to various brokerdealers is determined by a fund’s adviser based on its best judgment and in a manner deemed fair and reasonable to shareholders and consistent with the adviser’s obligation to obtain the best execution of purchase and sales orders in making this determination the adviser considers the same factors for the best execution of purchase and sales orders listed above accordingly in selecting brokerdealers to execute a particular transaction and in evaluating the best overall terms available a fund’s adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act provided to the funds andor other accounts over which a fund’s adviser exercises investment discretion a fund’s adviser may cause a fund to pay a brokerdealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another brokerdealer for effecting the same transaction provided that a fund’s adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such brokerdealer viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of a fund’s adviser to the funds to the extent such services are permissible under the safe harbor requirements of section e of the securities exchange act and consistent with applicable sec guidance and interpretation such brokerage and research services might consist of advice as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts market data stock quotes last sale prices and trading volumes shareholders of the funds should understand that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to a fund’s adviser in connection with its services to other clients and not all the services may be used by the adviser in connection with the fund under the policy for jpmim “soft dollar” services refer to arrangements that fall within the safe harbor requirements of section e of the securities exchange act as amended which allow jpmim to allocate client brokerage transactions to a brokerdealer in exchange for products or services that are research and brokeragerelated and provide lawful and appropriate assistance in the performance of the investment decisionmaking process these services include third party research market data services and proprietary brokerdealer research the funds receive proprietary research where brokerdealers typically incorporate the cost of such research into their commission structure many brokers do not assign a hard dollar value to the research they provide but rather bundle the cost of such research into their commission structure it is noted in this regard that some research that is available only under a bundled commission structure is particularly important to the investment process however the funds other than the us equity funds except the jpmorgan equity index fund jpmorgan research market neutral fund jpmorgan realty income fund jpmorgan research equity longshort fund and jpmorgan tax aware equity fund do not participate in soft dollar arrangements for market data services and thirdparty research the us equity funds except the jpmorgan equity index fund jpmorgan research market neutral fund jpmorgan realty income fund jpmorgan research equity longshort fund and jpmorgan tax aware equity fund participate in soft dollar arrangements whereby a brokerdealer provides market data services and thirdparty research in addition to proprietary research in order to obtain such research the adviser may utilize a client commission arrangement “cca” ccas are agreements between an investment adviser and executing broker whereby the investment adviser and the broker agree to allocate a portion of commissions to a pool of credits maintained by the broker that are used to pay for eligible brokerage and research services the adviser will only   part ii   enter into and utilize ccas to the extent permitted by section e of the securities exchange act as required by interpretive guidance issued by the sec any ccas entered into by the adviser with respect to commissions generated by the us equity funds will provide that  the brokerdealer pay the research preparer directly and  the brokerdealer take steps to assure itself that the client commissions that the adviser directs it to use to pay for such services are only for eligible research under section e scrm does not enter into soft dollar arrangements whereby a broker pays for research services such as bloomberg reuters or factset from time to time scrm may receive or have access to research generally provided by a broker to the broker’s institutional clients that trade with the broker in the sector of the securities markets in which scrm is active namely in the case of real estate securities in addition scrm may consider the valueadded quality of proprietary broker research received from brokers in allocating trades to brokers subject always to the objective of obtaining best execution jpmaam itself generally does not execute individual securities trading but instead allocates client assets to subadvisers who execute securities trading or to underlying funds jpmaam performs due diligence prior to allocating client assets to subadvisers or to underlying funds and that due diligence includes a review of the subadvisers’ andor underlying funds’ trading practices periodically thereafter such due diligence includes a review of the best execution policies of the subadvisers and the underlying funds’ investment advisers jpmaam does not engage in any soft dollar arrangements at this time although it will review and perform diligence on the soft dollar policies and practices of any subadvisers it allocates assets to and of underlying fund in which it invests client assets investment decisions for each fund are made independently from those for the other funds or any other investment company or account managed by an adviser any such other investment company or account may also invest in the same securities as the trusts when a purchase or sale of the same security is made at substantially the same time on behalf of a given fund and another fund investment company or account the transaction will be averaged as to price and available investments allocated as to amount in a manner which the adviser of the given fund believes to be equitable to the funds and such other investment company or account in some instances this procedure may adversely affect the price paid or received by a fund or the size of the position obtained by a fund to the extent permitted by law the adviser may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased by it for a fund with those to be sold or purchased by it for other funds or for other investment companies or accounts in order to obtain best execution in making investment recommendations for the trusts the adviser will not inquire or take into consideration whether an issuer of securities proposed for purchase or sale by the trusts is a customer of the adviser or their parents or subsidiaries or affiliates and in dealing with its commercial customers the adviser and their respective parent subsidiaries and affiliates will not inquire or take into consideration whether securities of such customers are held by the trusts subadvisers subadviser may place orders for the purchase and sale of securities that are held in the fund in executing portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or dealers it is the policy and principal objective of each subadviser to seek best execution each subadviser is required to consider all factors that it deems relevant when assessing best execution for the fund including for example the breadth of the market in the security the price of the security the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission if any for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis in addition when selecting brokers to execute transactions and in evaluating the best execution each subadviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended provided by the broker each subadviser is also authorized to cause the fund to pay a commission to a broker who provides such brokerage and research services for executing a portfolio transaction which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker would have charged for effecting that transaction each subadviser must determine in good faith however that such commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided viewed in terms of that particular transaction or in terms of all the accounts over which each subadviser exercises investment discretion brokerage and research services received from such brokers will be in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by each subadviser the fund may purchase and sell portfolio securities through brokers who provide a subadviser with brokerage and research services the fees of each subadviser are not reduced by reason of its receipt of such brokerage and research services generally a subadviser does not provide any services to the fund except portfolio investment management and related recordkeeping services the adviser may request that a subadviser employ certain specific brokers who   part ii   have agreed to pay certain fund expenses the use of such brokers is subject to best execution and there is no specific amount of brokerage that is required to be placed through such brokers it is possible that certain of the services received by a subadviser attributable to a particular transaction will primarily benefit one or more other accounts for which investment discretion is exercised by the subadviser for details of brokerage commissions paid by the funds see

recommend that sponsor’s mutual fund over other mutual funds similarly if a financial intermediary receives greater compensation for one share class versus another that financial intermediary may have

each fund declares and pays dividends and distributions as described under “distribution and tax matters” in the prospectuses dividends may differ between classes as a result of differences in distribution expenses or other classspecific expenses dividends and capital gains distributions paid by a fund are automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund unless the shareholder has elected to have them paid in cash dividends and distributions to be paid in cash are credited to the shareholder’s preassigned bank account or are mailed by check in accordance with the customer’s instructions the funds reserve the right to discontinue alter or limit the automatic reinvestment privilege at any time if a shareholder has elected to receive dividends andor capital gain

known as the offering price shares are also redeemed at nav minus any applicable deferred sales charges each class of shares in each fund has a different nav this is primarily because each class has class specific expenses such as distribution and shareholder servicing fees the nav per share of a class of a fund is equal to the value of all the assets attributable to that class minus the liabilities attributable to that class divided by the number of outstanding shares of that class the money market funds excluding prime money market fund will continue to value their portfolio of securities using the amortized cost method provided that certain conditions are met including that the fund’s board of trustees continues to believe that the amortized cost valuation fairly reflects the marketbased nav per share of the fund the purpose of this method of calculation is to attempt to maintain a constant nav per share of each fund of  no assurances can be given that this goal can be attained the amortized cost method of valuation values a security at its cost at the time of purchase and thereafter assumes an amortization that would produce a constant yield to maturity of any discount or premium regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument the board of trustees has established procedures and directed certain officers of the funds to monitor the differences between the navs calculated based on amortized cost and market value at predetermined intervals but no less frequently than weekly and to report to the board of trustees such differences if a difference of more than  of  occurs between valuation based on the amortized cost method and valuation based on market value the board of trustees may take steps necessary to reduce such deviation if it believes that such deviation will result in material dilution or any unfair results to investors or existing shareholders actions that may be taken by the board of trustees include i redeeming shares in kind ii selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten the average maturity of portfolio securities iii withholding or supplementing dividends iv utilizing a net asset value per share as determined by using available market quotations or v reducing the number of outstanding fund shares any reduction of outstanding shares will be accomplished by having each shareholder contribute to a fund’s capital the necessary shares on a pro rata basis each shareholder will be deemed to have agreed to such contribution in these circumstances by his or her investment in the funds in its discretion the board of trustees of the money market funds may elect to calculate the price of a fund’s shares once per day further with regard to the money market funds the board of trustees has empowered management to temporarily suspend one or more cutoff times for a fund other than the last cutoff time of the day the nav of each class of shares of the prime money market fund is calculated using marketbased values the following is a discussion of the procedures used by the funds in valuing their assets for marketbased navs securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued at their current market value other securities and assets including securities for which market quotations are not readily available market quotations are determined not to be reliable or their value has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of trading on the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded for example a natural disaster affecting an entire country or region or an event that affects an individual company but before a fund’s nav is calculated may be valued at its fair value in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by the jp morgan funds’ board of trustees fair value represents a good faith determination of the value of a security or other asset based upon specifically applied procedures fair valuation determinations may require subjective determinations there can be no assurance that the fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair value was used in determining the fund’s nav equity securities listed on a north american central american south american or caribbean “americas” securities exchange are generally valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which the security is principally traded that is reported before the time when the net assets of the funds are valued the value of securities listed on the nasdaq stock market inc is generally the nasdaq official closing price generally trading of foreign equity securities on most foreign markets ie nonwestern hemisphere is completed before the close in trading in us markets the funds have implemented fair value pricing on a daily basis for all foreign equity securities and investments with foreign equity reference obligations the fair value pricing utilizes the quotations of an independent pricing service trading on foreign markets may also take place on days on which the us markets and the funds are closed shares of exchangetraded funds etfs are generally valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which the etf is principally traded shares of openend mutual funds are valued at their respective navs   part ii   fixed income securities are valued using market quotations supplied by approved independent third party pricing services affiliated pricing services or brokerdealers in determining security prices pricing services and brokerdealers may consider a variety of inputs and factors including but not limited to proprietary models that may take into account market transactions in securities with comparable characteristics yield curves optionadjusted spreads credit spreads estimated default rates coupon rates underlying collateral and estimated cash flows assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies will be converted into us dollars at the prevailing market rates from an approved independent pricing service as of  pm et options eg on stock indices or equity securities traded on us equity securities exchanges are valued at the composite mean price using the national best bid and offer quotes at the close of options trading on such exchanges options traded on foreign exchanges or us commodity exchanges are valued at the settled price or if no settled price is available at the last sale price available prior to the calculation of a fund’s nav exchange traded futures eg on stock indices debt securities or commodities are valued at the settled price or if no settled price is available at the last sale price as of the close of the exchanges on which they trade nonlisted overthecounter options and futures are valued at the evaluated price provided by a counterparty or brokerdealer swaps and structured notes are priced generally by an approved independent third party or affiliated pricing service or at an evaluated price provided by a counterparty or brokerdealer certain fixed income securities and swaps may be valued using market quotations or valuations provided by pricing services affiliated with the adviser valuations received by the funds from affiliated pricing services are the same as those provided to other affiliated and unaffiliated entities by these affiliated pricing services with respect to all funds securities or other assets for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations do not represent the value at the time of pricing including certain illiquid securities are fair valued in accordance with policies and procedures “policies” established by and under the supervision and responsibility of the trustees the board of trustees has established an audit and valuation committee to assist the board of trustees in its oversight of the valuation of the funds’ securities and delegated to jp morgan investment management inc an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of jpmorgan chase  co the “administrator” or “jpmim” the responsibility for implementing the daytoday operational aspects of the valuation process the administrator has created the jp morgan asset management “jpmam” americas valuation committee “vc” to oversee and carry out the policies for the valuation of investments held in the funds the vc is comprised of senior representatives from jpmim jpmam legal compliance and risk management and the funds’ chief compliance officer fair value situations could include but are not limited to  a significant event that affects the value of a fund’s securities eg news relating to natural disasters affecting an issuer’s operations or earnings announcements  illiquid securities  securities that may be defaulted or delisted from an exchange and are no longer trading or  any other circumstance in which the vc believes that market quotations do not accurately reflect the value of a security from time to time there may be errors in the calculation of the nav of a fund or the processing of purchases and redemptions shareholders will generally not be notified of the occurrence of an error or the resolution thereof delaware trusts jpmt i jpmt ii jpmt iii and jpmt iv jpmt i and jpmt ii were each formed

holdings are released on conditions of confidentiality which include appropriate trading prohibitions “conditions of confidentiality” include confidentiality terms included in written agreements implied by the nature of the relationship eg attorney–client relationship or required by fiduciary or regulatory principles eg custody services provided by financial institutions   part ii   disclosure of a fund’s portfolio securities as an exception to the funds’ normal business practice requires the business unit proposing such exception to identify a legitimate business purpose for the disclosure and to submit the proposal to the fund’s treasurer for approval following business and legal review additionally no compensation or other consideration is received by a fund or the fund’s adviser or any other person for these disclosures the funds’ trustees will review annually a list of such entities that have received such information the frequency of such disclosures and the business purpose therefor these procedures are designed to address conflicts of interest between the funds’ shareholders on the one hand and the fund’s adviser or any affiliated person of the fund or such entities on the other hand by creating a structured review and approval process which seeks to ensure that disclosure of information about the fund’s portfolio securities is in the best interests of the fund’s shareholders there can be no assurance however that a fund’s policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of portfolio holdings information will prevent the misuse of such information by individuals or firms in possession of such information in addition to the foregoing the portfolio holdings of certain of the adviser’s separately managed account investment strategies and other vehicles advised or subadvised by the adviser or its affiliates which are the same or substantially similar to certain of the jp morgan funds are made available on a more timely basis than the time period specified in the applicable prospectus it is possible that any such recipient of these holdings could trade ahead of or against a fund based on the information received finally the funds release information concerning any and all portfolio holdings when required by law such releases may include providing information concerning holdings of a specific security to the issuer of such security with regard to the money market funds not later than five business days after the end of each calendar month each fund will post detailed information regarding its portfolio holdings as well as its dollarweighted average maturity and dollarweighted average life as of the last day of that month on the jp morgan funds’ website and provide a link to the sec website where the most recent twelve months of publicly available information filed by the fund may be obtained in addition not later than five business days after the end of each calendar month each money market fund will file a

information on portfolio holdings no sooner than  days after month end the funds may post a portfolio characteristics summary to the jp morgan funds’ website at wwwjpmorganfundscom in addition other fund statistical information may be found on the jp morgan funds’ website from time to time proxy voting procedures and guidelines the board of trustees has delegated to the advisers and their affiliated advisers proxy voting authority with respect to the funds’ portfolio securities to ensure that the proxies of portfolio companies are voted in the best interests of the funds the funds’ board of trustees has adopted the adviser’s detailed proxy voting procedures the “procedures” that incorporate guidelines “guidelines” for voting proxies on specific types of issues the adviser and its affiliated advisers are part of a global asset management organization with the capability to invest in securities of issuers located around the globe because the regulatory framework and the business cultures and practices vary from region to region the guidelines are customized for each region to take into account such variations separate guidelines cover the regions of  north america  europe middle east africa central america and south america  asia exjapan and  japan respectively in addition scrm has adopted its own guidelines and procedures effective december   specific to the funds and accounts it manages notwithstanding the variations among the guidelines all of the guidelines have been designed with the uniform objective of encouraging corporate action that enhances shareholder value as a general rule in voting proxies of a particular security the adviser and its affiliated advisers will apply the guidelines of the region in which the issuer of such security is organized except as noted below proxy voting decisions will be made in accordance with the guidelines covering a multitude of both routine and nonroutine matters that the adviser and its affiliated advisers have encountered globally based on many years of collective investment management experience   part ii   to oversee and monitor the proxyvoting process the adviser has established a proxy committee and appointed a proxy administrator in each global location where proxies are voted effective december   scrm has established a separate proxy committee and appointed a separate proxy administrator the primary function of each proxy committee is to review periodically general proxyvoting matters review and approve the guidelines annually and provide advice and recommendations on general proxyvoting matters as well as on specific voting issues the procedures permit an independent voting service to perform certain services otherwise carried out or coordinated by the proxy administrator although for many matters the guidelines specify the votes to be cast for many others the guidelines contemplate casebycase determinations in addition there will undoubtedly be proxy matters that are not contemplated by the guidelines for both of these categories of matters and to override the guidelines the procedures require a certification and review process to be completed before the vote is cast that process is designed to identify actual or potential material conflicts of interest between the fund on the one hand and the fund’s investment adviser principal underwriter or an affiliate of any of the foregoing on the other hand and ensure that the proxy vote is cast in the best interests of the fund a conflict is deemed to exist when the proxy is for jpmorgan chase  co stock or for jp morgan funds or when the proxy administrator has actual knowledge indicating that a jpmorgan affiliate is an investment banker or rendered a fairness opinion with respect to the matter that is the subject of the proxy vote when such conflicts are identified the proxy will be voted by an independent third party either in accordance with jpmorgan proxy voting guidelines or by the third party using its own guidelines when other types of potential material conflicts of interest are identified the applicable proxy administrator and as necessary and applicable a legal representative from the applicable proxy committee will evaluate the potential conflict of interest and determine whether such conflict actually exists and if so will recommend how the adviser will vote the proxy in addressing any material conflict the adviser may take one or more of the following measures or other appropriate action removing or “walling off” from the proxy voting process certain adviser personnel with knowledge of the conflict voting in accordance with any applicable guideline if the application of the guideline would objectively result in the casting of a proxy vote in a predetermined manner or deferring the vote to or obtaining a recommendation from an third independent party in which case the proxy will be voted by or in accordance with the recommendation of the independent third party the following summarizes some of the more noteworthy types of proxy voting policies of the nonus guidelines     •   corporate governance procedures differ among the countries because of time constraints and local customs it is not always possible for the adviser to receive and review all proxy materials in connection with each item submitted for a vote many proxy statements are in foreign languages proxy materials are generally mailed by the issuer to the subcustodian which holds the securities for the client in the country where the portfolio company is organized and there may not be sufficient time for such materials to be transmitted to the adviser in time for a vote to be cast in some countries proxy statements are not mailed at all and in some locations the deadline for voting is two to four days after the initial announcement that a vote is to be solicited and it may not always be possible to obtain sufficient information to make an informed decision in good time to vote     •   certain markets require that shares being tendered for voting purposes are temporarily immobilized from trading until after the shareholder meeting has taken place elsewhere notably emerging markets it may not always be possible to obtain sufficient information to make an informed decision in good time to vote some markets require a local representative to be hired in order to attend the meeting and vote in person on our behalf which can result in considerable cost the adviser also considers the cost of voting in light of the expected benefit of the vote in certain instances it may sometimes be in the fund’s best interests to intentionally refrain from voting in certain overseas markets from time to time     •   where proxy issues concern corporate governance takeover defense measures compensation plans capital structure changes and so forth the adviser pays particular attention to management’s arguments for promoting the prospective change the adviser’s sole criterion in determining its voting stance is whether such changes will be to the economic benefit of the beneficial owners of the shares     •   the adviser is in favor of a unitary board structure of the type found in the united kingdom as opposed to tiered board structures thus the adviser will generally vote to encourage the gradual phasing out of tiered board structures in favor of unitary boards however since tiered boards are still very prevalent in markets outside of the united kingdom local market practice will always be taken into account   part ii     •   the adviser will use its voting powers to encourage appropriate levels of board independence taking into account local market practice     •   the adviser will usually vote against discharging the board from responsibility in cases of pending litigation or if there is evidence of wrongdoing for which the board must be held accountable     •   the adviser will vote in favor of increases in capital which enhance a company’s longterm prospects the adviser will also vote in favor of the partial suspension of preemptive rights if they are for purely technical reasons eg rights offers which may not be legally offered to shareholders in certain jurisdictions however the adviser will vote against increases in capital which would allow the company to adopt “poison pill” takeover defense tactics or where the increase in authorized capital would dilute shareholder value in the long term     •   the adviser will vote in favor of proposals which will enhance a company’s longterm prospects the adviser will vote against an increase in bank borrowing powers which would result in the company reaching an unacceptable level of financial leverage where such borrowing is expressly intended as part of a takeover defense or where there is a material reduction in shareholder value     •   the adviser will generally vote against antitakeover devices     •   where social or environmental issues are the subject of a proxy vote the adviser will consider the issue on a casebycase basis keeping in mind at all times the best economic interests of its clients the following summarizes some of the more noteworthy types of proxy voting policies of the us guidelines     •   the adviser considers votes on director nominees on a casebycase basis votes generally will be withheld from directors who a attend less than  of board and committee meetings without a valid excuse b implement or renew a deadhand poison pill c are affiliated directors who serve on audit compensation or nominating committees or are affiliated directors and the full board serves on such committees or the company does not have such committees d ignore a shareholder proposal that is approved by a majority of either the shares outstanding or the votes cast based on a review over a consecutive two year time frame e are insiders and affiliated outsiders on boards that are not at least majority independent or f are ceos of publicallytraded companies who serve on more than three public boards or serve on more than four public company boards in addition votes are generally withheld for directors who serve on committees in certain cases for example the adviser generally withholds votes from audit committee members in circumstances in which there is evidence that there exists material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls     •   the adviser votes proposals to classify boards on a casebycase basis but normally will vote in favor of such proposal if the issuer’s governing documents contain each of eight enumerated safeguards for example a majority of the board is composed of independent directors and the nominating committee is composed solely of such directors     •   the adviser also considers management poison pill proposals on a casebycase basis looking for shareholderfriendly provisions before voting in favor     •   the adviser votes against proposals for a supermajority vote to approve a merger     •   the adviser considers proposals to increase common andor preferred shares and to issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan on a casebycase basis taking into account such factors as the extent of dilution and whether the transaction will result in a change in control     •   the adviser considers vote proposals with respect to compensation plans on a casebycase basis the analysis of compensation plans focuses primarily on the transfer of shareholder wealth the dollar cost of pay plans to shareholders and includes an analysis of the structure of the plan and pay practices of other companies in the relevant industry and peer companies other matters included in the analysis are the amount of the company’s outstanding stock to be reserved for the award of stock options whether the exercise price of an option is less than the stock’s fair market value at the date of the grant of the options and whether the plan provides for the exchange of outstanding options for new ones at lower exercise prices     •   the adviser also considers on a casebycase basis proposals to change an issuer’s state of incorporation mergers and acquisitions and other corporate restructuring proposals and certain social issue proposals   part ii     •   the adviser generally votes for management proposals which seek shareholder approval to make the state of incorporation the exclusive forum for disputes if the company is a delaware corporation otherwise the adviser votes on a case by case basis     •   the adviser generally supports management disclosure practices for environmental issues except for those companies that have been involved in significant controversies fines or litigation related to environmental issues     •   the adviser reviews say on pay proposals on a case by case basis with additional review of proposals where the issuer’s previous year’s proposal received a low level of support in accordance with regulations of the sec the funds’ proxy voting records for the most recent month period ended june  are on file with the sec and are available on the jp morgan funds’

reinvestment of such proceeds and any general assets of a trust not readily identified as belonging to a particular fund that are allocated to that fund by a trust’s board of trustees the board of trustees may allocate such general assets in any manner it deems fair and equitable it is anticipated that the factor that will be used by the board of trustees in making allocations of general assets to particular funds will be the relative net asset values of the respective funds at the time of allocation assets belonging to a particular fund are charged with the direct liabilities and expenses in respect of that fund and with a share of the general liabilities and expenses of a trust not readily identified as belonging to a particular fund that are allocated to that fund in proportion to

share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders   a excessive trading limits market timers may disrupt portfolio management and harm fund performance to the extent that a fund is unable to effectively identify market timers or a fund does not seek to identify market timers longterm investors may be adversely affected the funds do not authorize market timing and except for the funds identified in the prospectuses use reasonable efforts to identify market timers there is no assurance however that the funds will be able to identify and eliminate all market timers for example certain accounts include multiple investors and such accounts typically provide the funds with a net purchase or redemption request on any given day where purchasers of fund shares and redeemers of fund shares are netted against one another and the identity of individual purchasers and redeemers whose orders are aggregated are not known by the funds for purposes of the application of the excessive trading limitations jp morgan funds that invest in other jp morgan funds will be considered asset allocation programs within the stated exceptions to the excessive trading limits in the prospectuses additional information about class c shares the distributor pays a commission of  of the offering price on sales of class c shares the distributor keeps

applicable class c cdsc will be deducted from those payments unless such payments are made i monthly and constitute no more than  of  of your thencurrent balance in a fund each month or ii quarterly and constitute no more than  of  of your thencurrent balance in a fund each quarter if you withdraw more than the limits stated above in any given systematic withdrawal payment you will be charged a cdsc for the amount of the withdrawal over the limit for that month or quarter for accounts that allow systematic withdrawals only as a fixed dollar amount per month or quarter the applicable class c cdsc is waived provided that on the date of the systematic withdrawal the fixed dollar amount to be withdrawn when multiplied by  in the case of monthly payments or by four in the case of quarterly payments does not exceed  of your thencurrent balance in the fund if on any given systematic withdrawal date that amount would exceed  you will be charged a cdsc on the entire amount of that systematic withdrawal payment this calculation is repeated on each systematic withdrawal date for accounts that allow systematic withdrawals on a percentage basis a class c cdsc will be charged only on that amount of a systematic payment that exceeds the limits set forth above for that month or quarter your current balance in a fund for purposes of these calculations will be determined by multiplying the number of shares held by the thencurrent net asset value for shares of the applicable class cutoff times for purchase redemption and exchange orders orders to purchase exchange or redeem shares accepted by the funds or by a financial intermediary authorized to accept such orders on behalf of the funds by the cutoff times indicated in the funds’ prospectuses will be processed at the nav next calculated after the order is accepted by the fund or the financial intermediary under a variety of different types of servicing agreements if a financial intermediary that is authorized to accept purchase exchange andor redemption orders from investors on behalf of the funds accepts orders prior to the cutoff time for orders stated in the funds’ prospectuses the financial intermediary may transmit the orders to the funds by the deadlines stated in the servicing agreements the deadlines in the servicing agreements are generally later than the order cutoff times stated in the funds’ prospectuses   a additional information a fund may require medallion signature guarantees for changes that shareholders request be made in fund records with respect to their accounts including but not limited to changes in bank accounts for any written requests for additional account services made after a shareholder has submitted an initial account application to a fund and in

guarantee may be obtained from an approved bank broker savings and loan association or credit union under rule ad of the securities exchange act the funds reserve the right to change any of these policies at any time and may reject any request to purchase shares at a reduced sales charge investors may incur a fee if they effect transactions through a financial intermediary   a appendix b — description of ratings the following is a summary of published ratings by major credit rating agencies credit ratings evaluate only the safety of principal and interest payments not the market value risk of lower quality securities credit rating agencies may fail to change credit ratings to reflect subsequent events on a timely basis although the investment adviser considers security ratings when making investment decisions it also performs its own investment analysis and does not rely solely on the ratings assigned by credit agencies unrated securities will be treated as noninvestment grade securities unless the investment adviser determines that such securities are the equivalent of investment grade securities securities that have received different ratings from more than one agency are considered investment grade if at least one agency has rated the security investment grade unless otherwise indicated in a fund’s prospectus or sai certain funds are rated by nrsros in order to maintain a rating from a rating organization the funds may be subject to additional investment restrictions description of shortterm credit ratings standard  poor’s corporation “sp” a sp’s issue credit rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the opinion reflects sp’s view of the obligor’s capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due and may assess terms such as collateral security and subordination which could affect ultimate payment in the event of default issuer credit ratings can be either long term or short term shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered shortterm in the relevant market in the us for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days–including commercial paper shortterm ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on longterm obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings   a a shortterm obligation rated ‘a’ is rated in the highest category by standard  poor’s the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong within this category certain obligations are designated with a plus sign  this indicates that the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong       a a shortterm obligation rated ‘a’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories however the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory   a a shortterm obligation rated ‘a’ exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   b a shortterm obligation rated ‘b’ is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics ratings of ‘b’ ‘b’ and ‘b’ may be assigned to indicate finer distinctions within the ‘b’ category the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation however it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   b a shortterm obligation rated ‘b’ is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics but the obligor has a relatively stronger capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors   b a shortterm obligation rated ‘b’ is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics and the obligor has an average speculativegrade capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors     b b a shortterm obligation rated ‘b’ is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics and the obligor has a relatively weaker capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors   c a shortterm obligation rated ‘c’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   d a shortterm obligation rated ‘d’ is in payment default the ‘d’ rating category is used when payments on an obligation including a regulatory capital instrument are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor’s believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the ‘d’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized dual ratings sp assigns “dual” ratings to all debt issues that have a put option or demand feature as part of their structure the first rating addresses the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest as due and the second rating addresses only the demand feature the longterm rating symbols are used for bonds to denote the longterm maturity and the shortterm rating symbols for the put option for example ‘aaaa’ with us municipal shortterm demand debt note rating symbols are used with the shortterm issue credit rating symbols for example ‘spa’ active qualifiers currently applied andor outstanding i this subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are different from the credit factors terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of principal on the obligation the ‘i’ subscript indicates that the rating addresses the interest portion of the obligation only the ‘i’ subscript will always be used in conjunction with the ‘p’ subscript which addresses likelihood of receipt of principal for example a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of “aaap nri” indicating that the principal portion is rated “aaa” and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated l ratings qualified with ‘l’ apply only to amounts invested up to federal deposit insurance limits p this subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors the terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are different from the credit factors terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of interest on the obligation the ‘p’ subscript indicates that the rating addresses the principal portion of the obligation only the ‘p’ subscript will always be used in conjunction with the ‘i’ subscript which addresses likelihood of receipt of interest for example a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of “aaap nri” indicating that the principal portion is rated “aaa” and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated pi ratings with a ‘pi’ subscript are based on an analysis of an issuer’s published financial information as well as additional information in the public domain they do not however reflect indepth meetings with an issuer’s management and are therefore based on less comprehensive information than ratings without a ‘pi’ subscript ratings with a ‘pi’ subscript are reviewed annually based on a new year’s financial statements but may be reviewed on an interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuer’s credit quality preliminary preliminary ratings with the “prelim” qualifier may be assigned to obligors or obligations including financial programs in the circumstances described below assignment of a final rating is conditional on the receipt by sp’s of appropriate documentation sp’s reserves the right not to issue a final rating moreover if a final rating is issued it may differ from the preliminary rating     •   preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations most commonly structured and project finance issues pending receipt of final documentation and legal opinions     •   preliminary ratings are assigned to rule  shelf registrations as specific issues with defined terms are offered from the master registration a final rating may be assigned to them in accordance with sp’s policies     •   preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations that will likely be issued upon the obligor’s emergence from bankruptcy or similar reorganization based on latestage reorganization plans documentation and   b   discussions with the obligor preliminary ratings may also be assigned to the obligors these ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality of the reorganized or postbankruptcy issuer as well as attributes of the anticipated obligations     •   preliminary ratings may be assigned to entities that are being formed or that are in the process of being independently established when in sp’s opinion documentation is close to final preliminary ratings may also be assigned to these entities’ obligations     •   preliminary ratings may be assigned when a previously unrated entity is undergoing a wellformulated restructuring recapitalization significant financing or other transformative event generally at the point that investor or lender commitments are invited the preliminary rating may be assigned to the entity and to its proposed obligations these preliminary ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality of the obligor as well as attributes of the anticipated obligations assuming successful completion of the transformative event should the transformative event not occur sp’s would likely withdraw these preliminary ratings     •   a preliminary recovery rating may be assigned to an obligation that has a preliminary issue credit rating sf the sf subscript is assigned to all issues and issuers to which a regulation such as the european union regulation on credit rating agencies requires the assignment of an additional symbol which distinguishes a structured finance instrument or obligor as defined in the regulation from any other instrument or obligor the addition of this subscript to a credit rating does not change the definition of that rating or our opinion about the issue’s or issuer’s creditworthiness t this symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their contracts to full maturity or should certain events occur to terminate and cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date unsolicited unsolicited ratings are those credit ratings assigned at the initiative of sp’s and not at the request of the issuer or its agents inactive qualifiers no longer applied or outstanding  this symbol indicated continuance of the ratings is contingent upon sp’s receipt of an executed copy of the escrow agreement or closing documentation confirming investments and cash flows discontinued use in august  c this qualifier was used to provide additional information to investors that the bank may terminate its obligation to purchase tendered bonds if the longterm credit rating of the issuer is below an investmentgrade level andor the issuer’s bonds are deemed taxable discontinued use in january  pr the letters ‘pr’ indicate that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk q a ‘q’ subscript indicates that the rating is based solely on quantitative analysis of publicly available information discontinued use in april  r the ‘r’ modifier was assigned to securities containing extraordinary risks particularly market risks that are not covered in the credit rating the absence of an ‘r’ modifier should not be taken as an indication that an obligation will not exhibit extraordinary noncredit related risks sp discontinued the use of the ‘r’ modifier for most obligations in june  and for the balance of obligations mainly structured finance transactions in november  fitch ratings “fitch” a shortterm issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the shortterm vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation shortterm ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as “short term” based on market convention typically this means up to  months for corporate sovereign and structured obligations and up to  months for obligations in us public finance markets   b f highest shortterm credit quality indicates the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments may have an added “” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature   f good shortterm credit quality good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial obligations   f fair shortterm credit quality the intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate   b speculative shortterm credit quality minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions     c high shortterm default risk default is a real possibility   rd restricted default indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments although it continues to meet other obligations applicable to entity ratings only   d indicates a broadbased default event for an entity or the default of a specific shortterm obligation limitations of the shortterm ratings scale specific limitations relevant to the shortterm ratings scale include     •   the ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood over any given time period     •   the ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer’s securities or stock or the likelihood that this value may change     •   the ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer’s securities or stock     •   the ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an obligation should an obligation default     •   the ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer or transaction’s profile other that the agency’s opinion on the relative vulnerability to default of the rated issuer or obligation moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” moody’s shortterm ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor shortterm financial obligations ratings may be assigned to issuers shortterm programs or to individual shortterm debt instruments such obligations generally have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months unless explicitly noted moody’s employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers   p issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations   p issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have a strong ability to repay shortterm debt obligations   p issuers or supporting institutions rated prime have an acceptable ability to repay shortterm obligations   np issuers or supporting institutions rated not prime do not fall within any of the prime rating categories   note canadian issuers rated p or p have their shortterm ratings enhanced by the seniormost long term rating of the issuer its guarantor or supportprovider dominion bond rating service “dbrs” the dbrs shortterm debt rating scale provides an opinion on the risk that an issuer will not meet its shortterm financial obligations in a timely manner ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer and the relative ranking of claims the r and r rating categories are further denoted by the subcategories “high” “middle” and “low”   b r high highest credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is exceptionally high unlikely to be adversely affected by future events   r middle superior credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is very high differs from r high by a relatively modest degree unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events   r low good credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is substantial overall strength is not as favourable as higher rating categories may be vulnerable to future events but qualifying negative factors are considered manageable   r high upper end of adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable may be vulnerable to future events   r middle adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable may be vulnerable to future events or may be exposed to other factors that could reduce credit quality   r low lower end of adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable may be vulnerable to future events a number of challenges are present that could affect the issuer’s ability to meet such obligations   r lowest end of adequate credit quality there is a capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due may be vulnerable to future events and the certainty of meeting such obligations could be impacted by a variety of developments   r speculative credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is uncertain   r highly speculative credit quality there is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to meet shortterm financial obligations as they fall due   d a financial obligation has not been met or it is clear that a financial obligation will not be met in the near future or a debt instrument has been subject to a distressed exchange a downgrade to d may not immediately follow an insolvency or restructuring filing as grace periods other procedural considerations or extenuating circumstance may exist description of bank ratings moody’s moody’s bank financial strength ratings bfsrs represent moody’s opinion of a bank’s intrinsic safety and soundness and as such exclude certain external credit risks and credit support elements that are addressed by moody’s bank deposit ratings in addition to commercial banks moody’s bfsrs may also be assigned to other types of financial institutions such as multilateral development banks governmentsponsored financial institutions and national development financial institutions unlike moody’s bank deposit ratings bsfrs do not address the probability of timely payment instead bsfrs are a measure of the likelihood that a bank will require assistance from third parties such as its owners its industry group or official institutions bsfrs do not take into account the probability that the bank will receive such external support nor do they address risks arising from sovereign actions that may interfere with a bank’s ability to honor its domestic or foreign currency obligations factors considered in the assignment of bsfrs include bankspecific elements such as financial fundamentals franchise value and business and asset diversification although bsfrs exclude the external factors specified above they do take into account other risk factors in the bank’s operating environment including the strength and prospective performance of the economy as well as the structure and relative fragility of the financial system and the quality of banking regulation and supervision   a banks rated a possess superior intrinsic financial strength typically they will be institutions with highly valuable and defensible business franchises strong financial fundamentals and a very predictable and stable operating environment   b banks rated b possess strong intrinsic financial strength typically they will be institutions with valuable and defensible business franchises good financial fundamentals and a predictable and stable operating environment   b c banks rated c possess adequate intrinsic financial strength typically they will be institutions with more limited but still valuable business franchises these banks will display either acceptable financial fundamentals within a predictable and stable operating environment or good financial fundamentals within a less predictable and stable operating environment   d banks rated d display modest intrinsic financial strength potentially requiring some outside support at times such institutions may be limited by one or more of the following factors a weak business franchise financial fundamentals that are deficient in one or more respects or an unpredictable and unstable operating environment   e banks rated e display very modest intrinsic financial strength with a higher likelihood of periodic outside support or an eventual need for outside assistance such institutions may be limited by one or more of the following factors a weak and limited business franchise financial fundamentals that are materially deficient in one or more respects or a highly unpredictable or unstable operating environment where appropriate a “” modifier will be appended to ratings below the “a” category and a “” modifier will be appended to ratings above the “e” category to distinguish those banks that fall in the higher and lower ends respectively of the generic rating category description of longterm credit ratings sp longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on standard  poor’s analysis of the following considerations     •   likelihood of payment — capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation     •   nature of and provisions of the obligation     •   protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors’ rights issue ratings are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations   aaa an obligation rated ‘aaa’ has the highest rating assigned by sp the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong   aa an obligation rated ‘aa’ differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong   a an obligation rated ‘a’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong   bbb an obligation rated ‘bbb’ exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated ‘bb’ ‘b’ ‘ccc’ ‘cc’ and ‘c’ are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics ‘bb’ indicates the least degree of speculation and ‘c’ the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions   bb an obligation rated ‘bb’ is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   b b an obligation rated ‘b’ is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated ‘bb’ but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   ccc an obligation rated ‘ccc’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation   cc an obligation rated ‘cc’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment   c a ‘c’ rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the ‘c’ rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instrument’s terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par   d an obligation rated ‘d’ is in payment default the ‘d’ rating category is used when payments on an obligation including a regulatory capital instrument are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor’s believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the ‘d’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized an obligation’s rating is lowered to ‘d’ upon completion of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par plus or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories   nr this indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poor’s does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy moody’s longterm obligation ratings moody’s longterm ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of financial obligations with an original maturity of one year or more they address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised such ratings use moody’s global scale and reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of default   aaa obligations rated aaa are judged to be of the highest quality with minimal credit risk   aa obligations rated aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk   a obligations rated a are considered uppermedium grade and are subject to low credit risk   baa obligations rated baa are subject to moderate credit risk they are considered mediumgrade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics   ba obligations rated ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk   b obligations rated b are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk   caa obligations rated caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk   ca obligations rated ca are highly speculative and are likely in or very near default with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest   c obligations rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest   b moody’s applies numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classified from aa through caa the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category fitch rated entities in a number of sectors including financial and nonfinancial corporations sovereigns and insurance companies are generally assigned issuer default ratings idrs idrs opine on an entity’s relative vulnerability to default on financial obligations the “threshold” default risk addressed by the idr is generally that of the financial obligations whose nonpayment would best reflect the uncured failure of that entity as such idrs also address relative vulnerability to bankruptcy administrative receivership or similar concepts although the agency recognizes that issuers may also make preemptive and therefore voluntary use of such mechanisms in aggregate idrs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on the agency’s view of their relative vulnerability to default rather than a prediction of a specific percentage likelihood of default   aaa highest credit quality ‘aaa’ ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk they are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events   aa very high credit quality ‘aa’ ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk they indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events     a high credit quality ‘a’ ratings denote expectations of low credit risk the capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong this capacity may nevertheless be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings   bbb good credit quality ‘bbb’ ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity   bb speculative ‘bb’ ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk particularly in the event of adverse economic change over time however business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met   b highly speculative ‘b’ ratings indicate that material default risk is present but a limited margin of safety remains financial commitments are currently being met however capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to deterioration in the business and economic environment   ccc substantial credit risk default is a real possibility   cc very high levels of credit risk default of some kind appears probable   c exceptionally high levels of credit risk default is imminent or inevitable or the issuer is in standstill conditions that are indicative of a ‘c’ category rating for an issuer include     •   the issuer has entered into a grace or cure period following nonpayment of a material financial obligation     •   the issuer has entered into a temporary negotiated waiver or standstill agreement following a payment default on a material financial obligation or     •   fitch otherwise believes a condition of ‘rd’ or ‘d’ to be imminent or inevitable including through the formal announcement of a coercive debt exchange   rd restricted default ‘rd’ ratings indicate an issuer that in fitch’s opinion has experienced an uncured payment default on a bond loan or other material financial obligation but which has not entered into bankruptcy filings administration receivership liquidation or other formal windingup procedure and which has not otherwise ceased business this would include     •   the selective payment default on a specific class or currency of debt   b   •   the uncured expiry of any applicable grace period cure period or default forbearance period following a payment default on a bank loan capital markets security or other material financial obligation     •   the extension of multiple waivers or forbearance periods upon a payment default on one or more material financial obligations either in series or in parallel or     •   execution of a coercive debt exchange on one or more material financial obligations   d default ‘d’ ratings indicate an issuer that in fitch ratings’ opinion has entered into bankruptcy filings administration receivership liquidation or other formal windingup procedure or which has otherwise ceased business default ratings are not assigned prospectively to entities or their obligations within this context nonpayment on an instrument that contains a deferral feature or grace period will generally not be considered a default until after the expiration of the deferral or grace period unless a default is otherwise driven by bankruptcy or other similar circumstance or by a coercive debt exchange “imminent” default typically refers to the occasion where a payment default has been intimated by the issuer and is all but inevitable this may for example be where an issuer has missed a scheduled payment but as is typical has a grace period during which it may cure the payment default another alternative would be where an issuer has formally announced a coercive debt exchange but the date of the exchange still lies several days or weeks in the immediate future in all cases the assignment of a default rating reflects the agency’s opinion as to the most appropriate rating category consistent with the rest of its universe of ratings and may differ from the definition of default under the terms of an issuer’s financial obligations or local commercial practice note the modifiers “” or “” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories such suffixes are not added to the ‘aaa’ longterm idr category or to longterm idr categories below ‘b’ limitations of the issuer credit rating scale specific limitations relevant to the issuer credit rating scale include     •   the ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood over any given time period     •   the ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer’s securities or stock or the likelihood that this value may change     •   the ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer’s securities or stock     •   the ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an obligation should an issuer default     •   the ratings do not opine on the suitability of an issuer as a counterparty to trade credit     •   the ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer’s business operational or financial profile other than the agency’s opinion on its relative vulnerability to default dbrs longterm obligations the dbrs longterm rating scale provides an opinion on the risk of default that is the risk that an issuer will fail to satisfy its financial obligations in accordance with the terms under which an obligations has been issued ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer and the relative ranking of claims all rating categories other than aaa and d also contain subcategories “high” and “low” the absence of either a “high” or “low” designation indicates the rating is in the middle of the category   aaa highest credit quality the capacity for the payment of financial obligations is exceptionally high and unlikely to be adversely affected by future events   aa superior credit quality the capacity for the payment of financial obligations is considered high credit quality differs from aaa only to a small degree unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events   b a good credit quality the capacity for the payment of financial obligations is substantial but of lesser credit quality than aa may be vulnerable to future events but qualifying negative factors are considered manageable   bbb adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of financial obligations is considered acceptable may be vulnerable to future events   bb speculative non investmentgrade credit quality the capacity for the payment of financial obligations is uncertain vulnerable to future events   b highly speculative credit quality there is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to meet financial obligations   cccccc very highly speculative credit quality in danger of defaulting on financial obligations there is little difference between these three categories although cc and c ratings are normally applied to obligations that are seen as highly likely to default or subordinated to obligations rated in the ccc to b range obligations in respect of which default has not technically taken place but is considered inevitable may be rated in the c category   d a financial obligation has not been met or it is clear that a financial obligation will not be met in the near future or a debt instrument has been subject to a distressed exchange a downgrade to d may not immediately follow an insolvency or restructuring filing as grace periods or extenuating circumstances may exist description of insurance ratings moody’s insurance financial strength ratings moody’s insurance financial strength ratings are opinions of the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company insurance financial strength ratings shown in connection with propertycasualty groups represent the ratings of individual companies within those groups as displayed in moody’s insurance industry ratings list the rating of an individual propertycasualty company may be based on the benefit of its participation in an intercompany pooling agreement pooling agreements may or may not provide for continuation of inforce policyholder obligations by pool members in the event that the propertycasualty insurer is sold to a third party or otherwise removed from the pooling agreement moody’s assumes in these ratings that the pooling agreement will not be modified by the members of the pool to reduce the benefits of pool participation and that the insurer will remain in the pool moody’s makes no representation or warranty that such pooling agreement will not be modified over time nor does moody’s opine on the probability that the rated entity may be sold or otherwise removed from the pooling agreement longterm insurance financial strength ratings moody’s rating symbols for insurance financial strength ratings are identical to those used to indicate the credit quality of longterm obligations these rating gradations provide investors with a system for measuring an insurance company’s ability to meet its senior policyholder claims and obligations   aaa insurance companies rated aaa offer exceptional financial security while the credit profile of these companies is likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair their fundamentally strong position   aa insurance companies rated aa offer excellent financial security together with the aaa group they constitute what are generally known as highgrade companies they are rated lower than aaa companies because longterm risks appear somewhat larger   a insurance companies rated a offer good financial security however elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future   b baa insurance companies rated baa offer adequate financial security however certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time   ba insurance companies rated ba offer questionable financial security often the ability of these companies to meet policyholder obligations may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded in the future   b insurance companies rated b offer poor financial security assurance of punctual payment of policyholder obligations over any long period of time is small   caa insurance companies rated caa offer very poor financial security they may be in default on their policyholder obligations or there may be present elements of danger with respect to punctual payment of policyholder obligations and claims   ca insurance companies rated ca offer extremely poor financial security such companies are often in default on their policyholder obligations or have other marked shortcomings   c insurance companies rated c are the lowestrated class of insurance company and can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever offering financial security moody’s appends numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classification from aa through caa the modifier  indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category shortterm insurance financial strength ratings shortterm insurance financial strength ratings are opinions of the ability of the insurance company to repay punctually its shortterm senior policyholder claims and obligations the ratings apply to senior policyholder obligations that mature or are payable within one year or less specific obligations are considered unrated unless individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company   p insurers or supporting institutions rated prime have a superior ability for repayment of senior shortterm policyholder claims and obligations   p insurers or supporting institutions rated prime have a strong ability for repayment of senior shortterm policyholder claims and obligations   p insurers or supporting institutions rated prime have an acceptable ability for repayment of senior shortterm policyholder claims and obligations   np insurers or supporting institutions rated not prime np do not fall within any of the prime rating categories when ratings are supported by the credit of another entity or entities then the name or names of such supporting entity or entities are listed within parenthesis beneath the name of the insurer or there is a footnote referring to the name or names of the supporting entity or entities in assigning ratings to such insurers moody’s evaluates the financial strength of the affiliated insurance companies commercial banks corporations foreign governments or other entities but only as one factor in the total rating assessment moody’s makes no representation and gives no opinion on the legal validity or enforceability of any support arrangement sp insurer financial strength rating definitions a sp’s insurer financial strength rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms insurer financial strength ratings are also assigned to health maintenance organizations and similar health plans with respect to their ability to pay under their policies and contracts in accordance with their terms   b this opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser furthermore the opinion does not take into account deductibles surrender or cancellation penalties timeliness of payment nor the likelihood of the use of a defense such as fraud to deny claims for organizations with crossborder or multinational operations including those conducted by subsidiaries or branch offices the ratings do not take into account potential that may exist for foreign exchange restrictions to prevent financial obligations from being met insurer financial strength ratings do not refer to an organization’s ability to meet nonpolicy ie debt obligations assignment of ratings to debt issued by insurers or to debt issues that are fully or partially supported by insurance policies contracts or guarantees is a separate process from the determination of insurer financial strength ratings and follows procedures consistent with issue credit rating definitions and practices an insurer financial strength rating is not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by an insurer longterm insurer financial strength ratings an insurer rated ‘bbb’ or higher is regarded as having financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments   aaa an insurer rated ‘aaa’ has extremely strong financial security characteristics ‘aaa’ is the highest insurer financial strength rating assigned by sp   aa an insurer rated ‘aa’ has very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher   a an insurer rated ‘a’ has strong financial security characteristics but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings   bbb an insurer rated ‘bbb’ has good financial security characteristics but is more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are higherrated insurers an insurer rated ‘bb’ or lower is regarded as having vulnerable characteristics that may outweigh its strengths ‘bb’ indicates the least degree of vulnerability within the range ‘cc’ the highest   bb an insurer rated ‘bb’ has marginal financial security characteristics positive attributes exist but adverse business conditions could lead to insufficient ability to meet financial commitments   b an insurer rated ‘b’ has weak financial security characteristics adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments   ccc an insurer rated ‘ccc’ has very weak financial security characteristics and is dependent on favorable business conditions to meet financial commitments   cc an insurer rated ‘cc’ has extremely weak financial security characteristics and is likely not to meet some of its financial commitments   r an insurer rated ‘r’ is under regulatory supervision owing to its financial condition during the pendency of the regulatory supervision the regulators may have the power to favor one class of obligations over others or pay some obligations and not others the rating does not apply to insurers subject only to nonfinancial actions such as market conduct violations   nr an insurer designated ‘nr’ is not rated which implies no opinion about the insurer’s financial security ratings from ‘aa’ to ‘ccc’ may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories fitch insurer financial strength ratings the insurer financial strength ifs rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization the ifs rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations such as guaranteed investment contracts the ifs rating reflects both the ability of the insurer to meet these obligations on a timely basis and expected recoveries received   b by claimants in the event the insurer stops making payments or payments are interrupted due to either the failure of the insurer or some form of regulatory intervention in the context of the ifs rating the timeliness of payments is considered relative to both contract andor policy terms but also recognizes the possibility of reasonable delays caused by circumstances common to the insurance industry including claims reviews fraud investigations and coverage disputes the ifs rating does not encompass policyholder obligations residing in separate accounts unitlinked products or segregated funds for which the policyholder bears investment or other risks however any guarantees provided to the policyholder with respect to such obligations are included in the ifs rating expected recoveries are based on the agency’s assessments of the sufficiency of an insurance company’s assets to fund policyholder obligations in a scenario in which payments have ceased or been interrupted accordingly expected recoveries exclude the impact of recoveries obtained from any government sponsored guaranty or policyholder protection funds expected recoveries also exclude the impact of collateralization or security such as letters of credit or trusteed assets supporting select reinsurance obligations ifs ratings can be assigned to insurance and reinsurance companies in any insurance sector including the life  annuity nonlife propertycasualty health mortgage financial guaranty residual value and title insurance sectors as well as to managed care companies such as health maintenance organizations the ifs rating does not address the quality of an insurer’s claims handling services or the relative value of products sold the ifs rating uses the same symbols used by the agency for its international and national credit ratings of longterm or shortterm debt issues however the definitions associated with the ratings reflect the unique aspects of the ifs rating within an insurance industry context obligations for which a payment interruption has occurred due to either the insolvency or failure of the insurer or some form of regulatory intervention will generally be rated between ‘b’ and ‘c’ on the longterm ifs rating scales both international and national international shortterm ifs ratings assigned under the same circumstances will align with the insurer’s international longterm ifs rating longterm international ifs ratings the following rating scale applies to foreign currency and local currency ratings ratings of ‘bbb’ and higher are considered to be “secure” and those of ‘bb’ and lower are considered to be “vulnerable”   aaa exceptionally strong ‘aaa’ ifs ratings denote the lowest expectation of ceased or interrupted payments they are assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations this capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events   aa very strong ‘aa’ ifs ratings denote a very low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments they indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations this capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events   a strong ‘a’ ifs ratings denote a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments they indicate strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations this capacity may nonetheless be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings   bbb good ‘bbb’ ifs ratings indicate that there is currently a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments the capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations on a timely basis is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and economic conditions are more likely to impact this capacity   bb moderately weak ‘bb’ ifs ratings indicate that there is an elevated vulnerability to ceased or interrupted payments particularly as the result of adverse economic or market changes over time however business or financial alternatives may be available to allow for policyholder and contract obligations to be met in a timely manner   b weak ‘b’ ifs ratings indicate two possible conditions if obligations are still being met on a timely basis there is significant risk that ceased or interrupted payments could occur in the future but a limited margin of safety remains capacity for continued timely payments is contingent upon   b   a sustained favorable business and economic environment and favorable market conditions alternatively a ‘b’ ifs rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments but with the potential for extremely high recoveries such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of ‘rr’ outstanding   ccc very weak ‘ccc’ ifs ratings indicate two possible conditions if obligations are still being met on a timely basis there is a real possibility that ceased or interrupted payments could occur in the future capacity for continued timely payments is solely reliant upon a sustained favorable business and economic environment and favorable market conditions alternatively a ‘ccc’ ifs rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments and with the potential for average to superior recoveries such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of ‘rr’ superior ‘rr’ good and ‘rr’ average   cc extremely weak ‘cc’ ifs ratings indicate two possible conditions if obligations are still being met on a timely basis it is probable that ceased or interrupted payments will occur in the future alternatively a ‘cc’ ifs rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments with the potential for average to belowaverage recoveries such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of ‘rr’ average or ‘rr’ below average   c distressed ‘c’ ifs ratings indicate two possible conditions if obligations are still being met on a timely basis ceased or interrupted payments are imminent alternatively a ‘c’ ifs rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments and with the potential for below average to poor recoveries such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of ‘rr’ below average or ‘rr’ poor “” or “” may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating category such suffixes are not added to ratings in the ‘aaa’ category or to ratings below the ‘b’ category shortterm ifs ratings a shortterm insurer financial strength rating stifs rating provides an assessment of the nearterm financial health of an insurance organization and its capacity to meet senior obligations to policyholders and contractholders that would be expected to be due within one year the analysis supporting the stifs rating encompasses all of the factors considered within the context of the ifs rating but with greater weighting given to an insurer’s nearterm liquidity financial flexibility and regulatory solvency characteristics and less weight given to longerterm issues such as competitiveness and earnings trends the agency will only assign a stifs rating to insurers that also have been assigned an ifs rating currently stifs ratings are used primarily by us life insurance companies that sell shortterm funding agreements the stifs rating uses the same international ratings scale used by the agency for shortterm debt and issuer ratings   f insurers are viewed as having a strong capacity to meet their nearterm obligations when an insurer rated in this rating category is designated with a  sign it is viewed as having a very strong capacity to meet nearterm obligations   f insurers are viewed as having a moderately strong capacity to meet their nearterm obligations   f insurers are viewed as having an adequate capacity to meet their nearterm obligations   b insurers are viewed as having a weak capacity to meet their nearterm obligations   c insurers are viewed as having a very weak capacity to meet their nearterm obligations recovery ratings recovery ratings are assigned to selected individual securities and obligations these currently are published for most individual obligations of corporate issuers with idrs in the ‘b’ rating category and below and for most distressed or defaulted structured finance obligations rated “ccc” or below among the factors that affect recovery rates for securities are the collateral the seniority relative to other obligations in the capital structure where appropriate and the expected value of the company or underlying collateral in distress   b the recovery rating scale is based upon the expected relative recovery characteristics of an obligation upon the curing of a default emergence from insolvency or following the liquidation or termination of the obligor or its associated collateral for structured finance recovery ratings are designed to estimate recoveries on a forwardlooking basis while taking into account the time value of money recovery ratings are an ordinal scale and do not attempt to precisely predict a given level of recovery as a guideline in developing the rating assessments the agency employs broad theoretical recovery bands in its ratings approach based on historical averages but actual recoveries for a given security may deviate materially from historical averages   rr outstanding recovery prospects given default ‘rr’ rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering – of current principal and related interest   rr superior recovery prospects given default ‘rr’ rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering – of current principal and related interest   rr good recovery prospects given default ‘rr’ rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering – of current principal and related interest   rr average recovery prospects given default ‘rr’ rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering – of current principal and related interest   rr below average recovery prospects given default ‘rr’ rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering – of current principal and related interest   rr poor recovery prospects given default ‘rr’ rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering – of current principal and related interest limitations of the recovery ratings scale specific limitations relevant to the recovery ratings scale include     •   the ratings do not predict a specific percentage of recovery should a default occur     •   the ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer’s securities or stock or the likelihood that this value may change     •   the ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer’s securities or stock     •   the ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer or transaction’s profile other than the agency’s opinion on the relative loss severity of the rated obligation should the obligation default recovery ratings in particular reflect a fundamental analysis of the underlying relationship between financial claims on an entity or transaction and potential sources to meet those claims the size of such sources and claims is subject to a wide variety of dynamic factors outside the agency’s analysis which will influence actual recovery rates description of shortterm municipal bond ratings moody’s shortterm obligation ratings there are three rating categories for shortterm municipal obligations that are considered investment grade these ratings are designated as municipal investment grade mig and are divided into three levels — mig  through mig  in addition those shortterm obligations that are of speculative quality are designated sg or speculative grade mig ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation   mig  this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows highly reliable liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing   b mig  this designation denotes strong credit quality margins of protection are ample although not so large as in the preceding group   mig  this designation denotes acceptable credit quality liquidity and cashflow protection may be narrow and market access for refinancing is likely to be less wellestablished   sg this designation denotes speculativequality credit quality debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection demand obligation ratings in the case of variable rate demand obligations vrdos a twocomponent rating is assigned a long or shortterm debt rating and a demand obligation rating the first element represents moody’s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with scheduled principal and interest payments the second element represents moody’s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the ability to receive purchase price upon demand “demand feature” using a variation of the mig rating scale the variable municipal investment grade or vmig rating when either the long or shortterm aspect of a vrdo is not rated that piece is designated nr eg aaanr or nrvmig  vmig rating expirations are a function of each issue’s specific structural or credit features   vmig  this designation denotes superior credit quality excellent protection is afforded by the superior shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand   vmig  this designation denotes strong credit quality good protection is afforded by the strong shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand   vmig  this designation denotes acceptable credit quality adequate protection is afforded by the satisfactory shortterm credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand   sg this designation denotes speculativegrade credit quality demand features rated in this category may be supported by a liquidity provider that does not have an investment grade shortterm rating or may lack the structural andor legal protections necessary to ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand sp municipal shortterm note ratings a sp’s us municipal note rating reflects sp’s opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to the notes notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating notes with an original maturity of more than three years will most likely receive a longterm debt rating in determining which type of rating if any to assign sp’s analysis will review the following considerations     •   amortization schedule — the larger the final maturity relative to other maturities the more likely it will be treated as a note and     •   source of payment — the more dependent the issue is on the market for its refinancing the more likely it will be treated as a note note rating symbols are as follows   sp strong capacity to pay principal and interest an issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus  designation   sp satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes   sp speculative capacity to pay principal and interest   b description of preferred stock ratings dbrs preferred share rating scale the dbrs preferred share rating scale is used in the canadian securities market and is meant to give an indication of the risk that a borrower will not fulfill its full obligations in a timely manner with respect to both dividend and principal commitments every dbrs rating is based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the borrowing entity each rating category is denoted by the subcategories “high” and “low” the absence of either a “high” or “low” designation indicates the rating is in the middle of the category this scale may also apply to certain hybrid securities in which case references to dividend throughout will reflect interest commitments of the hybrid security   pfd preferred shares rated pfd are of superior credit quality and are supported by entities with strong earnings and balance sheet characteristics pfd securities generally correspond with companies whose senior bonds are rated in the aaa or aa categories as is the case with all rating categories the relationship between senior debt ratings and preferred share ratings should be understood as one where the senior debt rating effectively sets a ceiling for the preferred shares issued by the entity however there are cases where the preferred share rating could be lower than the normal relationship with the issuer’s senior debt rating   pfd preferred shares rated pfd are of satisfactory credit quality protection of dividends and principal is still substantial but earnings the balance sheet and coverage ratios are not as strong as pfd rated companies generally pfd ratings correspond with companies whose senior bonds are rated in the “a” category   pfd preferred shares rated pfd are of adequate credit quality while protection of dividends and principal is still considered acceptable the issuing entity is more susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions and there may be other adverse conditions present which detract from debt protection pfd ratings generally correspond with companies whose senior bonds are rated in the higher end of the bbb category   pfd preferred shares rated pfd are speculative where the degree of protection afforded to dividends and principal is uncertain particularly during periods of economic adversity companies with preferred shares rated pfd generally coincide with entities that have senior bond ratings ranging from the lower end of the bbb category through the bb category   pfd preferred shares rated pfd are highly speculative and the ability of the entity to maintain timely dividend and principal payments in the future is highly uncertain entities with a pfd rating generally have senior bond ratings of b or lower preferred shares rated pfd often have characteristics that if not remedied may lead to default   d a security rated d implies the dividend or principal payment is in default per the legal documents the issuer has made it clear that this will be the case in the near future or in certain cases that there has been a distressed exchange as such the non payment of a dividend does not necessarily give rise to the assignment of a d rating in some cases dbrs may not assign a d rating under a bankruptcy announcement scenario as allowances for grace periods may exist in the underlying legal documentation once assigned the d rating will continue until such time as the rating is discontinued or reinstated by dbrs   b
