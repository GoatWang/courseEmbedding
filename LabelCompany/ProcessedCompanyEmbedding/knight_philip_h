httpwwwnikecom ■ in  philip h knight began selling track shoes out of the trunk of his car forty years later he presided over the largest and most visible athletic apparel company in the world from  to  knight and his former track coach bill bowerman distributed japanesemade running shoes in america and gradually laid the foundation for the nike empire by the late s the nike swoosh trademark had become ubiquitous and knight was well on his way toward managing a multibilliondollar company beginnings of nike three events shaped knights future as the leader of nike the first occurred in  when he met bowerman his coach on the university of oregon track team bowerman was a former olympian whose passion for athletes and innovation would eventually inspire knight to create a business dedicated to those two things when knight began his business selling shoes to track athletes bowerman became his partner the philip h knight apwide world photos  second event occurred when knight was attending business school at stanford university in response to an assignment from professor frank shallenberger knight devised a business and marketing plan for importing highquality running shoes from japan and selling them in the united states at a high profit margin in a sense the vision of nike was born in that class the third event occurred in  when knight traveled to japan and met with executives from the onitsaka company which distributed tiger running shoes knight talked himself into a distribution contract with the company and when the executives asked which company he represented knight blurted out the first thing to come into his head blue ribbon sports the trip initiated knights lifelong fascination with japanese culture and presaged the globalization of nike blue ribbon sports in  knight and bill bowerman both invested  to start blue ribbon sports which would work together with the onitsaka company to develop and distribute running shoes for the north american market as the company struggled to grow knight worked as a certified public accountant and taught at portland state university over the next few years brs retail stores opened in santa monica california and eugene oregon and the company began to assemble employees who would later take on key roles at nike in  alone knight sold  million worth of tiger shoes by the end of  contract disagreements with onitsaka prompted knight and bowerman to consider starting their own shoe company knight paid a former portland state student to develop the swoosh design and jeff johnson a blue ribbon sports employee literally dreamed up the nike name the first model of shoe the cortez debuted at the  olympic trials and in that first year nike had revenues of more than  million focusing on the athlete being an athlete himself knight wanted to shape his company around the needs of athletes he also wanted to create products that the worlds greatest athletes would want to use and be associated with at first knight reached out to olympic track athletes such as the longdistance runner steve prefontaine who would influence other runners to try the shoes in  nike approached the tennis star john mcenroe and signed him to an endorsement deal this choice of spokesperson reflected knights vision that the great athlete was the ultimate free spirit by  nike had captured onehalf of the athletic shoe market and carried out its initial public offering on the new york stock exchange the escalating wealth of the company allowed nike to sign additional topflight athletes to endorsement contracts including highly lucrative relationships with michael jordan and tiger woods weathering criticism as nikes market share grew throughout the s and s so did public criticism of the companys business strategies much of this criticism focused directly on knight whose enigmatic personality and casual appearance became a focus of the news media at the  olympic games michael jordan and other national basketball association players with nike endorsements refused to appear on television with the insignia of their official reebok sweat suits showing when knight in trying to defuse the controversy failed to vigorously support the athletes his relationship with some of them was strained the greatest controversy knight had to confront in the s was growing criticism of how nike contracted with sweatshops in southeast asia to produce its shoes although knight eventually responded to nikes critics with a program of reforms he and nike continued to be a prime focus of many antiglobalization groups continual expansion knight was vigilant to keep nike at the top of the industry in the late s when reebok briefly supplanted nike as the most profitable athletic shoe company knight streamlined the nike campus in beaverton oregon and gave it a corporate atmosphere while maintaining the image of a company run by casually rebellious athletes in the s despite criticism knight involved the company in environmental and community service activities at the same time nike branched out into hockey golf and soccer apparel opened huge niketown stores in shopping malls and continued its dominance in the area of trackandfield apparel as the result of this aggressive expansion nike had more than  billion in yearly sales before  knight was said to be not fond of advertising yet slogans such as just do it and images such as that of michael jordan soaring through the air cemented nikes place in the industry nike advertisements portrayed great athletes as objects worthy of worship but also implied that everyone has greatness within themselves the global power of these messages was such that in  nikes international sales exceeded its us revenues for the first time in the companys history see

campaign and called for dave frohnmayer president of the school to support the workers rights consortium wrc on april   students began a sitin at johnson hall the uos administrative center in early april an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization fair labor association fla would receive no consideration from the university as it was perceived as a group founded funded and backed by nike and other corporations and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations university president dave frohnmayer subsequently signed a oneyear contract with the wrc and knights reaction was to withdraw a us million commitment toward the autzen stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university in a public statement knight criticized the wrc for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided while praising the fla for being balanced in its approach in the face of ongoing conflict with students frohnmayer sided with knights assertion that the wrc was providing unbalanced representation and in october  according to the eugene weekly frohnmayer stated  he would refuse to pay dues to the wrc based on a legal opinion from uo general counsel melinda grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability grier claimed the wrc had not yet incorporated had not yet filed as a nonprofit and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment on february   the oregon university system enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business

would refuse to pay dues to the wrc based on a legal opinion from uo general counsel melinda grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability grier claimed the wrc had

misguided while praising the fla for being balanced in its approach in the face of ongoing conflict with students frohnmayer sided with knights assertion that the wrc was providing unbalanced representation and in october  according to the eugene weekly frohnmayer stated  he would refuse to pay dues to the wrc based on a legal opinion from uo general counsel melinda grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability grier claimed the wrc had not yet incorporated had not yet filed as a nonprofit and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment on
