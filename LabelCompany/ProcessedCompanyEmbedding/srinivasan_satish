biology research program my 0 the heart pumps blood which carries oxygen and other nutrients throughout the body plasma is released from blood vessels to nourish the tissues the lymphatic system functions to return this tissue fluid to blood circulation a condition called lymphedema results when the lymphatic vasculature is damaged accumulating fluids cause swelling in the tissues that can lead to infections inflammation and pain surgical damage to lymphatic vessels causes lymphedema in millions of people every year currently only conservative treatments like massage and compression bandages are available in my lab we are studying the genes and signaling pathways responsible for the development and growth of the lymphatic vasculature we also focus on the role of the valves that regulate fluid flow within the vascular system valves are present within lymphatic vessels veins and in the heart a range of diseases such as spider veins varicose veins lymphedema and cardiac valve defects occur if the valves are not formed correctly or if they are damaged by injury or disease by studying the genes responsible for the formation or functioning of valves we can develop better strategies to repair these problems research my goals are to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating lymphatic and valvular endothelial cell development and maintenance the mammalian lymphatic vasculature is important for returning the extravasated plasma fluids in tissue space back to blood circulation absorption of digested lipids from the intestine and in immune surveillance lymphedema is a disfiguring and mobility restricting disease that results due to the abnormal functioning of the lymphatic vasculature lymphedema is a common disorder that results either due to mutations in genes that regulate lymphatic vascular development or more often due to infection or surgical damage to the lymphatic vessels lymphatic vasculature is also considered as a major route for tumor metastasis especially melanoma and breast cancer despite its importance diagnosis of lymphatic disorders and the identification of new targets to treat those ailments are limited valves regulate the unidirectional flow of fluids blood or lymph in the mammalian vascular system valves are present in the heart veins and the lymphatic vessels and are crucial for the normal physiology of the cardiovascular system in addition there is also a unique type of valve known as the lymphovenous valve that regulates the return of lymph fluid including all of the digested lipids approximately  liters per day in an average human being back to venous circulation congenital cardiac valve defects are common causes for childhood mortality and morbidity calcification of cardiac valves occurs in approximately 0 of people who are at least  years old this leads to valvular stenosis that could result in atherosclerosis pulmonary edema thromboembolism cardiac hypertrophy and sudden cardiac death a highfat diet is known to aggravate this disease infection and noninfection cancer related endocarditis also damages cardiac valves in the aging population a range of venous valve defects such as spider veins varicose veins and venous insufficiency are common incompetent venous valves results in ineffective blood flow causing pooling of blood and thrombosis this result in embolism problems in wound healing and tissue necrosis in severe cases this leads to the stroke or amputation of the limbs defects in formation or functioning of lymphatic valves cause lymphedema lymphectomy performed during breast cancer treatment frequently damages both lymphatic vessels and valves resulting in lymphedema no information is currently available regarding lymphovenous valves in human disease although using mouse models i have recently demonstrated that defects in these valves could lead to lymphedema and chylothorax srinivasan and oliver  i believe that similar to the other cardiovascular valves they are likely to undergo aging related degeneration despite their importance our understanding of valves during normal development and in disease is limited with increase in the median age of the general population and with improving treatment options for cancer we have an urgent need to better understand the biology of valves and develop treatment methodologies to treat valve disorders beyond conventional synthetic replacement valves that are associated with significant mortality and morbidity despite their differences the development of both lymphatic and valvular endothelial cells is regulated by a common set of transcription factors and signaling molecules our goal is to understand these molecular mechanisms and translate this knowledge into effective treatments brief cv
