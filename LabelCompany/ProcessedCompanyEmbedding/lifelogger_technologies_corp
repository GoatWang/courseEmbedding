machine longshort equitysummaryinvestor interest in wearable cameras has caused a rise in lifeloggers stock price however a failed kickstarter campaign indicates a lack of consumer interest in lifeloggers potential product lifelogger has continually missed product release targets over the past  months and appears to be behind on its current plan lifelogger spent just  on rd and has no patents lifelogger is running out of cash  auditors have issued a going concern clause expressing doubt about lifeloggers ability to remain in business the market currently values lifelogger at over  million with no product minimal consumer interest no patents and a rapidly depleting cash balance the author believes shares have  downside author updatemay    amlogg filed its q today  the company generated  revenue of course it has no product and a  operating loss  cash was down to  at march    the company has been issuing stock as payment for services to some vendors at a price of c  i expect logg has burned through most of its remaining cash since march  and expect a capital raise very soon  i continue to believe that this stock will ultimately be a zero  fueled by enthusiasm over the potential for wearable cameras lifelogger otcqblogg shares have risen fivefold from their  low while wearable camera market growth is evidenced by the tremendous success of gopro nasdaqgpro selling millions in sporting applications and tasers tasr rapid growth in wearable cameras for law enforcement personnel lifelogger has yet to release a product as the company has repeatedly delayed its product launch discussed below moreover a failed kickstarter campaign indicates that consumers lack interest in lifeloggers product lifelogger ended  with just  in cash but expects that it will burn through  during  implying that the company will have to raise capital soon or shutter its doors with minimal customer interest no product no patents continued losses a rapidly depleting cash position investors should avoid lifelogger shares despite these many negatives at  per share the market is valuing lifelogger at over  million enterprising investors may wish to consider shorting lifelogger shares at last check interactive brokers had many shares available for borrow as i expect that ultimately lifelogger shares will prove to be worthless background formerly snap online a web marketing company which never achieved more than  in annual revenue in january of  the company changed its name to lifelogger and began focusing on the wearable camera market according to the most recent k lifelogger has three fulltime employees the companys ceo is steve garner who has a background in real estate consumer interest there does not seem to be a market for lifelogger last year lifelogger attempted a kickstarter campaign the campaign lasted  days ending in july of  but lifelogger only received contributions of  well short of its  target indicating minimal interest in its product continued launch delays the company has yet to introduce a commercial product and has consistently missed target launch dates at the beginning  ces consumer electronic show lifelogger ceo steve garner said the company would be mass producing in may of  and be available to customers in june of  can be seen at  in the video as mentioned above the company launched a kickstarter campaign in may but failed to attract much interest while lifeloggers kickstarter campaign failed it was able to raise  during the second half of   in september and another  in december  despite receiving over x the funding sought by the kickstarter campaign lifelogger still has not released a product further in the companys december  presentation lifelogger targeted public beta testing to begin in may source company presentation on its website lifelogger solicits visitors to participate in its beta testing i signed up to participate in beta testing but received an email telling me that beta testing had not yet begun it seems likely that there will be continued delays given the companys lack of financial resources discussed below it seems inconceivable that lifelogger will commercialize a product any time in the near future further given how many offerings are already in the marketplace there are at least  different makers of wearable cameras available today at amazon it is unclear how lifelogger would differentiate itself if the company were able to bring a product to market financial distress  auditor issues going concern clause lifelogger had just  in cash as of december   the company is rapidly burning cash and will likely only be able to fund another  months of operation without another equity raise based on the expected  annual burn rate cited below in the liquidity and capital resources section this lead its accountants to issue a going concern clause source k as you can see above auditors have expressed substantial doubt about the companys ability to remain in business intellectual property without cash it is unclear how lifelogger can fund an rd program during  lifelogger spent just  on rd let alone attempt to market its product to customers further the only intellectual property the company owns is the name lifelogger as shown below lifelogger does not own any patents  this was confirmed by lena cati the companys investor contact lena works for the equity group an investor relations firm that represents lifelogger source k conclusion despite all of these negatives the company has a market capitalization of more than  million with continued operating losses a rapidly depleting cash balance no product and no patents the author expects that shares will ultimately prove to be worthless disclosure the author is short logg gpro the author
