hsn” business startupstartup fundamentals  lessons on innovation from joy mangano the “queen of hsn”by robert f brands  june   share on facebook tweet on twitter the movie joy tells the story of joy mangano aka the “queen of hsn” a serial innovator and multimillionaire entrepreneur who is most famously known for her miracle mop inventionwhile the movie starring jennifer lawrence as its title character is an entertaining and inspirational film it’s not a wholly accurate representation of mangano’s ragstoriches life story while the movie’s general premise closely aligns with mangano’s life story the accuracy of the bigscreen adaptation of mangano’s life is not what’s most relevant here more importantly we can glean so many lessons about business acumen and innovation from mangano here are four of the most acute business takeaways and innovation lessons don’t sit on great ideaswhile working at a vet’s office as a teenager mangano came up with the idea of fluorescent collar for animals to wear at night to increase their visibility to cars she didn’t act on this idea and when hartz a large pet supply company brought a similar product to market a year later mangano made a promise to herself that the next time she had a great idea she would bring it to market first in many categories being firsttomarket gives you a substantive advantage while teenaged mangano didn’t have the knowledge or financial wherewithal to get legal protection for her fluorescent collar idea this example still serves as a lesson for today’s innovators a key imperative for a successful innovation process is idea management as to which the intellectual property attorney is essential to the care feeding and protection of your ideas moreover patents are important tools for both offensive and defensive strategy the best ideas can often be found right in front of you necessity can sometimes breed invention after her  divorce mangano was struggling to pay the bills while working two jobs as a waitress and an airlinereservation manager and living with her three kids it was also in  that her idea for the miracle mop was born mangano says she was tired of the tedious mopping process—bending down putting her hands in dirty water manually ringing out the dirty mop—and knew there had to be a better way mangano’s better way was a selfwringing mop which later got named the miracle mop sometimes it’s more than having just a great product it’s the person that can make the product in  mangano borrowed money to make the miracle mop prototype and was fulfilling orders from her own home that first year she managed to sell a few thousand mops from home and then took her product to qvc as she explained to abc news “at first it was demonstrated on tv without me…and it didn’t do so well they wanted to return the mop” but mangano begged the qvc producers for a chance to sell it herself on air—and that chance paid off she sold  mops in  minutes “i got on stage and the phones went crazy and we sold out every last mop” oftentimes for an innovation to succeed you have to realize that the power of the innovation and brand lies within you as a person mangano started her onair career at qvc and then sold her company to hsn in  she’s still the face of the network hence her “queen of hsn” nickname and remains one of their most successful sellers always be innovating while the miracle mop is mangano’s most famous invention it’s definitely neither her only invention nor her most successful one her biggest hit is actually huggable hangers with  million sold to date impressively she also holds more than a hundred patents to her name some have been blockbusters and others have been failures while all it takes is one great hit it’s too risky to put all your eggs in one basket as such one should always be innovating  note the movie “joy” was released in us theatres on christmas day  as of may  you can rent or watch the movie on amazon video or itunes to watch the
